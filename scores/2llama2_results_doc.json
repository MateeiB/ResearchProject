    "doc": "Republican U.S House candidate Roger Williams of Texas promises to \"end the fraud of Obamacare\" in a mailer to Austin-area voters we spotted April 11, 2012.His mailer lists among promises broken by President Obama the notion that the 2010 overhaul of health care laws would create jobs. Under \"Promise Broken,\" the mailer says: \"The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office concluded ObamaCare will cost the U.S. more than 800,000 jobs.\"Really?Williams\u2019 footnoted backup was a Feb. 11, 2011, blog post on AmericanThinker.com saying that Doug Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, had just testified to the House Budget Committee that as of 2020-21, the law was projected to reduce U.S. employment by 800,000.PolitiFact researchers have explored this testimony and topic before, most recently for a June 2011 Truth-O-Meter article after U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann said in a Republican presidential debate: \"The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, has said that Obamacare will kill 800,000 jobs. What could the president be thinking by passing a bill like this, knowing full well it will kill 800,000 jobs?\"Broadly, the projection is open to misinterpretation.The CBO is a nonpartisan agency that provides economic analyses to members of Congress on how legislation will affect the federal budget and the economy. And in August 2010, it published a new outlook that considered the jobs impact of the just-approved health care law.While the CBO had determined the law would reduce \"the amount of labor used in the economy,\" that was not the same as concluding that 800,000 jobs would be shed.Let\u2019s begin with the negative effects the health care law could have on employment.The law was expected to cost some employers money, particularly large ones. Under its provisions, employers aren't required to offer insurance, yet if they don't and their workers make low wages and qualify for tax credits to buy insurance, then the employers will have to pay a fine. (This part of the law takes effect in 2014.) Even so, the CBO has said, fines imposed on large employers will affect low-wage workers the most.The CBO also projected the effects to be somewhat limited. \"To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation\u2019s economic productivity could be enhanced,\" the CBO said in its report. \"It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives.\"Still, that's not where the 800,000 jobs number comes from. It primarily comes from workers who choose not to work because they no longer have to work at jobs just to keep their health coverage.Here's how the CBO put it: \"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the legislation, on net, will reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by a small amount\u2014roughly half a percent\u2014primarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply. That net effect reflects changes in incentives in the labor market that operate in both directions: Some provisions of the legislation will discourage people from working more hours or entering the workforce, and other provisions will encourage them to work more. Moreover, many people will be unaffected by those provisions and will face the same incentives regarding work as they do under current law.\" Basically, the CBO was saying that that once some people working mostly to keep their health insurance have other options -- to enroll in Medicaid, or to qualify for tax breaks to buy insurance from a health exchange -- they might choose to work less. The CBO describes this as a \"small segment\" of the population, about half a percent of the labor force. Notably, the CBO doesn't use the 800,000 jobs number in its report; critics of the law have extrapolated that number by calculating what half a percent of the workforce equals. Then again, as noted, then-CBO director Douglas Elmendorf confirmed that number in his February 2011 testimony.  Elmendorf also explained, though, that the number was an extrapolation, and might not be precise. He said: \"That means that if the reduction in the labor used was workers working the average number of hours in the economy and earning the average wage, that there would be a reduction of 800,000 workers. \"In fact, as we mentioned in the -- in our announcements last summer, the legislation also creates incentives that might affect the number of hours people work, might affect the tendency to work with lower and higher income people. We haven't tried to quantify those things. But the impact is that these 800,000 (jobs) might not be exactly the number ...\" The CBO report also noted that the health care law could actually help economic productivity: \"To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation\u2019s economic productivity could be enhanced. It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives.\" PolitiFact rated Bachmann\u2019s claim -- that the law \"will kill 800,000 jobs\" -- Mostly False because it exaggerated the CBO\u2019s conclusions in a misleading fashion and included no qualifiers.When we inquired, a CBO staff spokeswoman, Deborah Kilroe, had no comment on the earlier PolitiFact analysis. Kilroe did say the CBO had done no additional analyses of projected reductions in employment due to the 2010 law."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, the label \"True\" is an appropriate description of the claim that more than 50 percent of immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras use at least one major welfare program once they arrive in the US. The article cites data from the Center for Immigration Studies, which relied on Census Bureau data to make this assertion.\n\nThe evidence presented in the article supports the claim that a significant portion of immigrants from these countries use welfare programs. According to the data, 57 percent of households headed by immigrants from El Salvador, 54 percent of Honduran households, and 49 percent of Guatemalan immigrant households use at least one major welfare program, compared to 24 percent of native households. These numbers suggest that a higher percentage of immigrants from these countries use welfare programs than native households.\n\nIt is worth noting that the article also highlights some limitations and caveats related to the data. For example, it notes that including children in the household's total income can lead to an inflated estimate of welfare use, and that some programs, such as Medicaid, may have a higher usage rate among immigrants than native households. However, these limitations do not alter the overall conclusion that a significant portion of immigrants from these countries use welfare programs.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is reasonable to label the claim that more than 50 percent of immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras use at least one major welfare program once they arrive in the US as true.",
    "doc": "The crisis at the border brought on by thousands of young people seeking entry, some with a parent and many without, has fueled an immigration debate that was already overheated. Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly took the government\u2019s ad hoc measures to stanch the influx and deal with those who are already here as proof of a broader problem with immigrants from Central America, particularly those from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. \"Our welfare system is strained to the limit now, so is the public school system,\" O\u2019Reilly said on his July 8, 2014, show The O\u2019Reilly Factor. \"About 50 percent of them lack a high school education. And more than 50 percent of immigrants from those three countries use at least one major welfare program once they get here. So the Obama administration is allowing millions of people to come in without the skills to compete in the marketplace. That is creating an underclass.\" A reader asked us to dig into the claim that more than 50 percent of the people from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras use at least one welfare program. We asked O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show for the sources behind that statement and did not hear back. But a little before his program, the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for lower immigration levels, released a fact sheet with the numbers O\u2019Reilly used. \"57 percent of households headed by immigrants from El Salvador use at least one major welfare program, as do 54 percent of Honduran households, and 49 percent of Guatemalan immigrant households. Among native households it is 24 percent,\" the fact sheet said. The publication relied on Census Bureau data, which counted \"welfare\" programs as including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps (now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP), Medicaid, free and reduced school lunches, Supplemental Security Income (SSI is for poor elderly, blind or disabled people), housing aid, and the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) food assistance program. We should note that several of those welfare-type programs are not available to people living here without permission -- including food stamps, TANF, housing subsidies, non-emergency Medicaid and SSI. The fact sheet made no distinction in the legal status of immigrants, nor did O\u2019Reilly. That aside, immigration researchers we reached said the statistics presented by the Center for Immigration Studies and repeated by O\u2019Reilly are reasonably accurate. Giovanni Peri, a professor of economics at the University California-Davis, said, \"the Center for Immigration Studies probably did it correctly from Current Population Statistics data.\" Another economist, Marianne Bitler at the University of California-Irvine, agreed. \"My guess is that their analysis is accurate for the family units they describe,\" Bitler said. That said, there are a couple of caveats researchers said are worth mentioning. Bitler noted how programs that help children could cause an entire household to be included in the tally. The Census, Bitler said, \"measures whether anyone in the household is getting SNAP, but not whether all residents are getting it. Similarly, I imagine a lot of the Medicaid use they capture is by children.\" Leighton Ku, a professor of health policy at George Washington University, gave an example of how this could play out. \"Suppose there is a family where the father is a Central American legal immigrant, a small business owner,\" Ku said. \"The wife is a U.S.-born citizen and their two children are U.S.-born citizens. One young child gets Medicaid or CHIP (health insurance for children), another gets school lunch and that is the only assistance they get. The whole household is now considered an \u2018immigrant welfare user.\u2019 \" The result: a higher percentage. Steven Camarota, the author of the Center for Immigration Studies fact sheet, defends his approach. \"It makes sense to calculate welfare by household because eligibility for most programs is based on household income,\" Camarota said. Another caveat: This difference in how people coming from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras use welfare programs depends on the specific program. Camarota himself noted in a 2012 study that immigrants use cash welfare programs -- TANF, SSI and state cash payments -- at about the same rate as people who were born here. \"Use of cash tends to be quite similar for immigrant and native households,\" Camarota wrote. \"If by \u2018welfare\u2019 one only means cash assistance programs, then immigrant use is roughly the same as that of natives.\" The numbers in that analysis showed 5.4 percent of U.S. natives received such aid, compared to 7.4 percent of Guatemalans, 5.3 percent of Honduransand 5 percent of Salvadorans. The gap substantially widens, however, when you include food aid (which included food stamps and free-reduced school lunches) and health care."

    "doc": "North Carolina prides itself on its role in the American Revolution, even claiming to be \"first in freedom.\" And ahead of Independence Day, Republican state Rep. Kelly Hastings hearkened back to the country\u2019s beginnings as he promised to protect taxpayers. \"The Seven Years\u2019 Warled to near bankruptcy for many countries; Britain\u2019s need to raise taxes fueled the American desire for independence,\" Hastings said in a tweet Sunday. \"I pray that I maintain the wisdom to spend money wisely, prevent budget deficits, and efficiently manage debt. In turn, we can continue to cut taxes and protect the taxpayers.\" The background to Hastings\u2019 promise: Gov. Roy Cooper had announced Friday that he would veto state House and Senate Republicans\u2019 proposed budget. Among other things, the budget did not include a plan for Medicaid expansion, which Cooper said was a must months before the budget was proposed. Many Republicans are wary of Medicaid expansion because they fear its reliance on federal tax dollars could backfire. Hastings, a five-term House member from Cherryville, said in an email interview Tuesday that he based his tweet on knowledge from history classes and the Declaration of Independence. \"I appreciate the role that North Carolina played in our independence,\" Hastings added. \"According to William S. Powell, the author of \u2018North Carolina: A History,\u2019 the Halifax Resolves document was the first official state action for independence.\" The adoption of the Halifax Resolves by North Carolina was the first official action calling for independence from Great Britain. The date of the resolution, April 12, 1776, appears on the North Carolina flag. It\u2019s part of the reason some North Carolina license plates say\"First in Freedom.\" The famous phrase \"no taxation without representation\" has been remembered as the inspiration for the American Revolution, but were taxes the main cause for revolution? We decided to investigate further. The Seven Years\u2019 War In Hastings\u2019 tweet, he referenced the Seven Years\u2019 War, a conflict started in 1756 between Great Britain and France, among other countries. In North America, the skirmish began as the French and Indian War with a border dispute with the French over the upper Ohio River Valley. The British forces, led by a young George Washington, were defeated by the French at Fort Necessity. Soon after, Great Britain retaliated. The scuffle escalated into a worldwide conflict because of the immense imperial power Great Britain, France and their European allies held around the world. At the time, Great Britain controlled the 13 colonies from the coast to the Appalachian Mountains, and France controlled the surrounding land west of the Appalachians from Louisiana stretching up to Canada. The Seven Years\u2019 War was a long and expensive affair for all parties involved. In the 1762 Treaty of Paris, France and Spain also lost a considerable amount of territory. However, even though Great Britain won the war because of its strong navy, it spent a great deal of money on the conflict \u2014 which it then tried to get from the colonies. \u2018Taxation without representation\u2019 Following the end of the French and Indian War, a series of taxes and policies, including the Stamp Act, the Townshend Tariffs and the Tea Act, were implemented in the Americas in order to help Great Britain cover the cost of winning a war in the colonies. Kathleen DuVal, professor of history at UNC Chapel Hill, said that colonists were equally as upset about being taxed as they were angry that they were not represented in the British government. \"Colonists did pay local taxes, which they viewed as legitimate because local governments, including colonial legislatures like North Carolina\u2019s, were locally elected,\" DuVal said. The colonists believed that, as British citizens, they should only be taxed with their consent and being taxed without representation was therefore tyranny. Hence the slogan, \"no taxation without representation.\" \"The new taxes that Parliament passed to pay down the Seven Years\u2019 War debt were an important cause of the Revolution, but the fact that colonists weren\u2019t represented in Parliament was central to their cause,\" DuVal said. \"The \u2018representation\u2019 in the phrase \u2018taxation without representation\u2019 was at least as important as the \u2018taxation.\u2019\" While taxation was a main cause for revolution, the reason why it was so abhorrent was not that the taxes were high and needed to be cut. It was a problem because the colonies had no say in how they wanted to be taxed. \"Among other things, the Revolution was not about a desire to CUT taxes,\" said Wayne E. Lee, a professor of Peace, War and Defense at UNC Chapel Hilll. Furthermore, if Britain had offered the colonists representation in Parliament before the war gained more momentum, the movement for independence probably would have fizzled out, DuVal said."

    "doc": "Campaigning in his home state of Texas, Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul told a crowd at Texas A&M University that he thinks the country is moving in the wrong direction.In addition to saying that the nation has \"too much tyranny,\" the Lake Jackson congressman criticized the number of people behind bars, saying he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s a reflection of how \"bad\" Americans are. His explanation: \"I think we have way too many laws on the books is what I think. Just on Jan. 1 of this year, there were 40,000 new laws put on the books in one day.\"Paul went on to say that he would like to be the first president to \"get rid of 40,000 laws,\" following up with a verbal walloping of the daily-published Federal Register, where proposed and new regulations are listed. He called the publication incomprehensible and said it should be shrinking, not growing.We wondered whether Paul was correct about the number of laws that went into effect on the first day of 2012.A quick Google search led us to the likely basis of such a figure. In a Dec. 27, 2011, press release, the National Conference of State Legislatures said U.S. states and territories passed more than 40,000 bills and resolutions into law in 2011. Yet, the release also said, laws do not always take effect at the start of a year. When we inquired about Paul\u2019s statement, campaign spokesman Gary Howard told us he thought Paul \"was including regulations found in the Federal Register.\" That seemed a possibility given the next part of his remarks.If so, though, Paul\u2019s count was way off.James Gattuso, a senior fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us that typically, the number of federal regulations put in place in a single year \u2014 and not all at the start of each year \u2014 ranges from 3,000 to 4,000, all of which are published in the Federal Register.Susan Dudley, director of George Washington University\u2019s Regulatory Studies Center who served as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under President George W. Bush, concurred with Gattuso\u2019s figure. She pointed us to a chart posted on the Federal Register\u2019s website that lists the number of new and proposed rules by year, starting in 1976. The 2011 total was 3,807. According to the data, the 1970s and 1980s were the high mark for regulations, when the total number of rules put in place were in the 6,000s and 7,000s.Dudley said those figures represent the most comprehensive statistics on federal regulations, big and small, from agencies throughout the government.Adding the number of proposed rules doesn\u2019t bring the total much closer to 40,000. In 2011, according to the data, there were 2,898 proposed rules, for a new and proposed regulation total of 6,705. And, again, that\u2019s for the whole year, not a single day.What if we include the number of federal laws effective Jan. 1, 2012?We didn\u2019t find an easy way to count the number of federal laws, if any, that went into effect then. Some legislation that is signed by the president specifies a future date that it will become effective while others take effect as soon as the president signs them. Also, the impact of some laws is not felt until a federal agency issues corresponding regulations.However, there\u2019s no indication that the number is anywhere close to 40,000.According to the White House website, President Barack Obama signed into law eight pieces of legislation in the nine days before Jan. 1, 2012, including a major appropriations bill and one that included a two-month extension of a payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits.Also, the Congressional Record of Jan. 3, 2012 says that in the previous 12 months, about 80 bills had become law.State legislatures, meanwhile, were much more active.The National Conference of State Legislatures\u2019 news release, noting that \"laws do not always become effective on Jan. 1,\" detailed some that did. A taste: Laws requiring businesses to enroll in the federal E-Verify program to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States were set to go into effect in Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina and Georgia, according to the release. Also, same-sex couples in Delaware and Hawaii earned the right to enter into civil unions.In a telephone interview and via email, Meagan Dorsch, a conference spokeswoman, told us that the group\u2019s researchers based its 40,000 figure on data they keep themselves through bill tracking, though they did not pin down exactly how many of those 40,000 pieces of legislation became effective the first day of 2012.Another hitch: We noticed that the 40,000 total includes both bills that have passed into law and resolutions, which often lack the significance of statutes. In its glossary of legislative terms, the NCSL defines a resolution as a document that \"expresses the sentiment or intent of the legislature or a chamber, that governs the business of the legislature or a chamber, or that expresses recognition by the legislature or a chamber.\" A snapshot: In 2011, Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed 129 concurrent resolutions sent to him by lawmakers, ranging from one memorializing the late Gov. Dolph Briscoe Jr. to another instructing a clerk to make technical corrections to Senate Bill 1420, which had to do with the Texas Department of Transportation.We asked Dorsch for a breakdown of the 40,000 figure by resolution and bill. She said the group did not separate bills from resolutions in making its count.Finally, we found two other entities with information on state-level bills passing into law.The Council of State Governments, based in Lexington, Ky., publishes data on the number of bills and resolutions that states enact each year. Information for 2011 isn\u2019t ready yet, but for some perspective, we checked out 2010. Corralling only bills enacted by state legislatures and not vetoed by the governor, we counted 14,227.A couple of notes on these figures: First, five states, including Texas, didn\u2019t have regular legislative sessions in 2010. Second, setting aside enacted resolutions may overlook some that have the force of law or would be considered substantive, like proposed constitutional amendments.If resolutions approved during 2010 regular and special sessions are included in our count, the total rises by about 13,000 \u2014 to 27,240. A note about these figures: The council had no information on resolutions for seven of the states that held regular sessions in 2010.Finally, we enlisted StateScape \u2014 a research firm in Alexandria, Va., that says it collects every measure introduced by state legislatures. Chad Robinson, the firm\u2019s research director, told us by email that its data shows that legislatures enacted 18,562 bills, excluding non-statutory resolutions, in 2011, a year when all state legislatures convened.That\u2019s less than half of 40,000.And it could even be that states are starting to approve fewer new laws. Robinson said by telephone that according to the firm's data, more bills passed into law in the previous two odd-numbered years when every state legislature was in session -- 20,238 bills passed into law in 2009 and 21,031 bills passed into law in 2007."

A few days ago, Nugent posted a horrific photo on Facebook of a bearded man, bloody knife in hand, squatting behind five gory heads. \"One of the subhuman mongrels our president set free,\" Nugent wrote in the caption. \"Feel safer yet?\" (Nugent created a controversy earlier this year when he called President Barack Obama a \"subhuman mongrel.\") A reader alerted us thatNugent's post was spreading fast (users have shared it more than 100,000 times)so we wanted to check whether the man in the photo is one of the five Taliban leaders released from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in exchange for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. He is not and there is no way that he could be. The image reportedly was tweeted by the man in the photo on March 15 and not one of the five Taliban prisoners. We say reportedly because the original tweet has since been removed. However,we can use news accounts to piece together what happened -- and why this image is not of the Taliban prisoners. For starters, the five Taliban officials were released May 31, 2014, more than two months after the image was first released. Tha man who originally tweeted the imagegoes by the name Abdurahman.Abdurahmancame from Iraq and lived in Holland for 10 years before returning to fight in Syria and Iraq. The image was the source ofan article in de Volkskrant, a major Dutch newspaper, on March 17.The article identifies the man in the image as Khalid K. from Almere, Netherlands. Although the photo itself is no longer available on the Web, the description in the Volkskrant article matches the image in Nugent\u2019s post. An American blog post from March 23 leaves no doubt the images are the same. The site D.C. Clothesline links back to the Volkskrant and includes the photo. On April 17, Live Leak, a British-based image and video sharing website, carried an entry with the photo. The headline was, \"Dutch-Iraqi ISIS terrorist cannibal butcher and behead five Al Qaeda terrorists beheader(sic).\" How'd things get mixed up? The image returned recently with people claiming it was Mohammad Fazl, one of the five Taliban prisoners swapped in exchange for Bergdahl. The urban myth website Snopes reviewed the revival of the disturbing photo on June 10. It noted thatthe image had appeared many times on Facebook with the claim that the man was \"Mohammad Fazi (sic), just one of those great terrorists that this administration traded for the deserter. He seems like a reallyproud terrorist in this photo. I sure hope everyone feels safer knowing this guy is now free.\" Without using Mohammed Fazl\u2019s name, Nugent apparently borrowed much from such posts. Fazl is a former Taliban deputy defense minister, one of the five men released from Guantanamo. Mohammed Fazl (left) and Abdurahman (right). We contacted Nugent\u2019s office for comment and did not hear back."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, I believe that the correct label for Gayle Smith's claim is \"Conflicting\". The evidence shows that while there has been some progress in reducing the number of out-of-school children globally, the trend is not necessarily positive and may even be reversing.\n\nThe article cites a United Nations report that states the number of out-of-school children has fallen by \"almost half\" since 2000. However, upon closer inspection, the actual decline is only 43%, which is significantly less than the claim made by Gayle Smith. Additionally, the article notes that current trends could be negative, rather than positive, and highlights that there has been largely no progress since 2007.\n\nFurthermore, the article points out that regional variation is significant, with some regions making much faster progress than others. For example, Southern Asia, which includes India, drove down the number of out-of-school children by nearly 70 percent, while Northern Africa saw a decrease of nearly 90 percent. On the other hand, Latin America and the Caribbean have seen a growth in the number of out-of-school children since 2010.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that Gayle Smith's claim of \"half as many children out of school today as there were 15 years ago\" is overstated and may not accurately reflect the current situation. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is the most appropriate.",
    "doc": "The new head of the U.S. Agency for International Development Gayle Smith gave policymakers a first look at her vision of what USAID should be doing. As she steps into the early rounds of defending the administration's budget request, Smith said in a speech on Capitol Hill that she\u2019s grateful that most of America\u2019s foreign assistance debate enjoys a lot of bipartisan support. She listed a number of fronts where this has helped lead to global progress, from curtailing the spread of HIV/AIDSto reducing extreme poverty. Smith also mentioned successes in education. \"I think everyone in the room knows that this is a moment of extraordinary progress,\" Smith said. \"Over the last 30 years, extreme poverty has been cut in half. Boys and girls are enrolling in primary school at nearly equal rates, and there are half as many children out of school today as there were 15 years ago.\" We wanted to fact-check Smith\u2019s claim about how many children are out of school. For the record, the first part of Smith\u2019s statement about boys and girls enrolling at equal rates is largely on the money. According to the World Bank, most parts of the world are at or close to parity in terms of seeing equal percentages of girls and boys who go to school. The two regions that lag behind are Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, but the gap is not enormous and they have made a lot of progress since 2000. Now, are there half as many children out of school today as there were 15 years ago? Benjamin Edwards, spokesman for USAID, told us that Smith\u2019s source was the United Nations 2015 Millennium Development Goals report. In the section on education, it says, \"Currently, 57 million children of primary school age are estimated to be out of school, down from 100 million in 2000.\" And in a list of bullet points, the report says the number has \"fallen by almost half.\" We note that if you do the math, the actual estimated decline is 43 percent. So what we have is a sort of statistical glide. The writers of a UN report massaged 43 percent to make it \"almost half,\" then someone at USAID moved things a bit further by dropping the qualifier \"almost\" and Smith ends up saying \"there are half as many children out of school.\" This might not matter, except there\u2019s reason to question the underlying estimate in that UN report. In fact, while the gains since 2000 are significant, current trends could be negative, not positive. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, better known as UNESCO, is the keeper of the original data. The most recent information goes only to 2013. Based on UNESCO's actual figures, the number of out-of-school children fell by 40 percent from 2000-13, as we can see in this table: 2000 2013 Change 2000-13 World 98,654,408 59,256,395 40% Caucasus and Central Asia 358,127 342,111 4% Latin America & the Caribbean 3,330,636 4,066,213 -22% Northern Africa 1,935,001 232,304 88% Sub-Saharan Africa 42,873,204 32,960,434 23% Western Asia 3,039,656 2,045,168 33% Eastern Asia 5,924,921 2,680,949 55% South-Eastern Asia 4,745,734 3,636,624 23% Southern Asia 33,849,211 10,349,757 69% Oceania 330,316 188,308 43% So based on hard data, the gains look less and less like \"about half.\" On top of that, in its 2015 report on out-of-school children, UNESCO flagged that there has been largely no progress since 2007. That year, about 60 million young children were not in school. And the agency warned that the situation could deteriorate. \"Progress has stalled and there are serious concerns that unless something changes \u2014 and fast \u2014 hard-won achievements on primary enrollment could begin to erode,\" the report said. A 2015 UNESCO policy paper put the problem in starker terms. It highlighted that the number of out-of-school children has been rising since 2010. That is true for both primary and secondary school-age children. Curiously, the writers of the UN Millennium Development Goals report had this information and posited that progress, at least globally, would continue. We looked at their statistical annex and found no explanation for this positive forecast. Elaine Unterhalter, professor of education and international development at University College London, told us there\u2019s even more reason today to doubt that steady progress is under way. \"The gains are based on data before the large-scale refugee crisis engulfing Syria and Iraq, and the internal displacement in Nigeria and Sudan,\" Unterhalter said. \"So, while definitely there are gains, we must be cautious about over-claiming.\" Uneven gains and stalled progress While Smith\u2019s figure is a bit high and runs counter to the trends since 2010, a further flaw is that it masks enormous regional variation. Southern Asia, which includes India, drove down the number of out-of-school children by nearly 70 percent. Northern Africa, reaching from Morocco to Egypt, had far fewer children to educate but saw nearly a 90 percent decrease in those that were not in school. Those gains stand in sharp contrast to the numbers for Latin America and the Caribbean where the problem grew worse, not better. In Sub-Saharan Africa with the largest number of young children, the decline was only about 25 percent. Sub-Saharan Africa faces a particular challenge. It is a region where the rising population of school-age children is rapidly outstripping the capacity of governments to expand their education systems. In its 2015 report, UNESCO said that decreases in just 11 nations accounted for over half of the global decline. Nicole Bella, a senior policy analyst at UNESCO, told us a key factor in those gains was pretty basic -- money. \"Low- and lower-middle income countries have allocated a higher percentage of Gross National Product to education since 1999, and aid to education has more than doubled in real terms,\" Bella said. Governments built more schools, hired more teachers and cut or eliminated school fees. Bella said some also started feeding students and passed laws designed to reach kids who live in poorer households. She noted that the poorest children are \"four times more likely not to go to school than the richest children, and five times more likely not to complete primary school.\" But Bella told us that government efforts to get more children into school have slowed. Unterhalter said that there\u2019s no simple solution to dealing with the remaining out-of-school children. The issues are many, and so a wide range of strategies would need to be brought to bear. Major hurdles The UNESCO study found that the single greatest reason why children aren\u2019t in school when they should be is war and other forms of armed conflict. Fighting destroys schools, scatters students and teachers, and often draws teenagers directly into the conflict as fighters themselves. Following the impact of war on schooling, the report cites \"entrenched gender roles\" that systematically reduce the opportunities for girls to go to school in the first place, or to remain in school if they start. The demand for child labor, and the family\u2019s need for a child to work, also diverts children from an education. One of the original Millennium Development Goals was to ensure that every child would be able to complete primary school. That goal has not been met and according to UNESCO, there is a real risk it will slide further out of reach."

The evidence provided in the article does not support this claim.\n\nFirstly, the article states that the United States argued for continued detention of Khairullah Khairkhwa, one of the five men released to Qatar in the Bergdahl deal, in a court case in 2011. However, the administration did not go to court to keep him in jail because they considered him a huge risk. Instead, the United States argued that Khairkhwa was a member of the Taliban or al-Qaida or associated forces at the time of his capture, which is supported by evidence from the Taliban's highest governing body and Khairkhwa's known association with Osama bin Laden.\n\nSecondly, the article quotes a law professor, Mark Denbeaux, who states that the decision does not say that it's the U.S. trying to keep them here, but rather defending the standard that someone is a lawful enemy combatant. This suggests that the administration's goal in detaining Khairkhwa was not to keep him in jail because of the perceived risk he posed, but rather to defend their right to detain him as a member of a terrorist organization.\n\nFinally, the article mentions that there were varying opinions within the administration on whether Khairkhwa was a risk, with some considering him \"high risk\" and others considering him more of a civilian than a military figure. This suggests that the administration did not have a unified view on the risk posed by Khairkhwa, which undermines the claim that they went to court to keep him in jail because of his perceived risk.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim that the Obama administration went to court to keep one of these five in jail at Guantanamo just three years ago because he was such a huge risk is Conflicting.

    "doc": "The merits of the prisoner exchange that resulted in the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from his Taliban captors continued to be a point of contention on this week\u2019s political Sunday shows. On Fox News Sunday, panelists debated the potential political fallout in the midterms and the 2016 elections from President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to swap five high-level Taliban officials from the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for Bergdahl. Stephen Hayes, a columnist for the conservative Weekly Standard, said he thought Obama\u2019s maneuver would be \"politically problematic.\" \"I think at a very base level, people who aren't following politics day in and day out, are looking at this Guantanamo five and saying, \u2018Why in the world would we do this?\u2019\" Hayes said. \"And the conflicts that we're hearing within the administration's own story. The administration went to court to keep one of these five in jail at Guantanamo just three years ago because he was such a huge risk, such a risk to U.S. national security. And now they're letting him walk. Those are the things you don't have to have a Ph.D. in national security studies to understand.\" Did Hayes find an example of the administration insisting one of the detainees was a risk, and then letting him walk free? (PolitiFact looked at the five freed prisoners in more detail here.) We asked Hayes to make the case to us. He showed us a recent column he wrote on Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa, one of the five men released to Qatar in the Bergdahl deal. He also sent us a link to a 2011 court case where he said the United States argued for continued detainment of Khairkhwa, a former Taliban governor, spokesman and Minister of the Interior. But this wasn\u2019t Obama\u2019s Justice Department going to court to keep Khairkhwa in jail because he was \"such a huge risk,\" as Hayes said. Actually, Khairkhwa, captured in 2002, was appealing for his release, saying he was being held illegally. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Guantanamo Bay detainees had the right to challenge the legality of their confinement. At question wasn\u2019t whether the Obama administration considered Khairkhwa a risk. They didn\u2019t have to prove that. In fact, the court makes that clear in its ruling: \"The government's authority to detain an enemy combatant is not dependent on whether an individual would pose a threat to the United States or its allies if released.\" This stemmed from a 2010 court decision, Awad vs. Obama, in which Adham Mohammed Ali Awad, a Yemeni national, argued that he was no longer a threat to the United States and therefore his detention was unlawful. But the court said that wasn\u2019t an issue. Rather, the Obama administration simply had to prove that, under the Authorization for Use of Military Force granted by Congress, Khairkhwa was a member of the Taliban or al-Qaida or associated forces at the time of his capture. The United States had ample evidence to make their case. Khairkhwa was part of the Taliban\u2019s highest governing body and was a known associate of Osama bin Laden. Therefore, most of the administration\u2019s case against Khairkhwa is centered on his past ties to the Taliban. There is no discussion of the risk he may or may not pose if he returned to Afghanistan. \"It\u2019s fair to say whoever said that hasn\u2019t read the decision,\" said Mark Denbeaux, a law professor at Seton Hall University who has represented multiple Guantanamo Bay prisoners. \"It doesn\u2019t say that it\u2019s the U.S. trying to keep them here, it\u2019s the U.S. defending the standard that someone is a lawful enemy combatant.\" \"The hearing (for Khairkhwa) took six years, and it concluded that he was a combatant for the Taliban, not that he was a terrorist,\" he added. \"They didn\u2019t even need to find out if he had attacked Americans.\" That\u2019s not to say the government did not view Khairkhwa as a risk. There were varying opinions on that from within the administration. In documents released by Wikileaks, the Department of Defense labeled Khairkhwa as \"high risk\" and warranted continued detention. Khairkhwa, according to Wikileaks documents, was highly intelligent and may have known more about \"the inner workings of the Taliban than any other detainee held.\" The administration, however, also once considered releasing Khairkhwa, who is a friend of Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai, in an effort to bring peace between the Taliban and the new Afghanistan government. The military considered him \"as more of a civilian than a military figure,\" according to Reuters."

    "justification": "The claim that \"71 percent of doctors say Hillary's health concerns are 'serious' and 'could be disqualifying'\" is false. The supporting article text provides several reasons why this label is appropriate:\n\n1. The survey was conducted by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), a small conservative/libertarian medical group with a largely conservative or libertarian membership. As the article notes, the AAPS has publicized discredited ideas such as vaccines causing autism and abortion increasing the risk of breast cancer. This raises questions about the objectivity and credibility of the survey results.\n2. The survey was poorly designed, as noted in the article. For example, respondents were given no choice but to agree with the statement that the concerns \"should be addressed as with full release of medical records,\" which could have influenced their answers. Additionally, the survey did not ask about each respondent's medical specialty, lumping together the evaluations of neurologists and gynecologists without context.\n3. The article highlights that the poll was based on a two-day online survey begun by the AAPS on Sept. 5, with only 3,700 known physicians on its email list receiving the invitation to participate. This is a small sample size compared to the American Medical Association's reported 224,503 members in 2012.\n4. The AAPS news release does not mention that the survey was limited to its members, further adding to the questionable validity of the results.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the claim of a significant consensus among doctors about Hillary Clinton's health is overstated and unreliable. The evidence provided undermines the credibility of the survey and suggests that any conclusion based on it would be misleading. Therefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate.",
    "doc": "Hillary's Clinton's physician said she's in good overall health, but that hasn't quelled speculation on the internet and elsewhere about the fitness of the Democratic nominee for president. That speculation was reinvigorated Sept. 11, 2016, when Clinton faltered while prematurely leaving a public event and her campaign revealed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier. In most cases, pneumonia is a short-term health problem. But on Sept. 8, three days before that illness came to light, a series of headlines surfaced on the Drudge Report, InfoWars and other conservative-leaning sites which typically reported that \"71 percent of doctors say Hillary's health concerns are 'serious' and 'could be disqualifying.'\" The sites used words like \"Bombshell poll\" and \"Shock Poll!\" At first blush, that sounds like a strong physician consensus. As it turns out, it's not 71 percent of doctors at all. It's 71 percent of doctors on the email list of a small conservative/libertarian medical group. In our previous reporting on the health of both Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump, we\u2019ve noted the folly of trying to diagnose a candidate's physical or mental health without actually examining that candidate. In mental health circles, it's considered unethical. The poll being cited by the bloggers is based on a two-day online survey begun Sept. 5 by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a Tucson-based organization with a largely conservative or libertarian membership that's concerned about the intrusion of government into medicine. The AAPS spent decades trying to block the implementation of Medicare, according to documentation on its website, and it opposes Obamacare. It has publicized the discredited ideas that vaccines can cause autism and abortion increases the risk of breast cancer. The group claims about 5,000 members. To give that some perspective, the American Medical Association, the nation's largest, reported 224,503 members in 2012. When we contacted AAPS, executive director Dr. Jane Orient and the group's webmaster and business manager, Jeremy Snavely, said the email invitation to participate in the Survey Monkey poll went to 3,700 known physicians on its email list. The email was opened by 1,050 people; 250 responded during the two-day window. Orient said the six-question survey was simply designed to see how its members felt about allegations made about Clinton's health. It was not an attempt to survey a representative sample of physicians, which would have been prohibitively expensive, she said. In response to the second question, 91 percent said they were aware \"of questions raised about the impact of past and current medical conditions on Hillary Clinton's fitness to serve as President.\" In the fourth question, 71 percent said their \"impression about the concerns\" was \"Serious \u2014 could be disqualifying for the position of President of the U.S.\" And in the fifth question, asked if they were aware of health issues Clinton had reported in the past and, in the final question, 73 percent said that any of those health issues would influence their vote for president. The poll was poorly designed. For example, in Question 4, 21 percent said the concern was \"likely overblown.\" But to give that answer, a doctor had no choice but to agree with the statement that the concerns \"should be addressed as with full release of medical records.\" The survey did not ask about each respondent's medical specialty, so the evaluations of neurologists, who might have better training on concussion issues, were lumped together with the responses of gynecologists. It did not ask the respondents if they had read the letter from Clinton's doctor asserting she had fully recovered from her 2012 concussion and blood clot in the brain or inquire where they had gotten their information on Clinton's health. And the survey did not ask comparable questions about Trump, whose doctor did not offer as much detail as Clinton's doctor and, instead, boasted that, if elected, Trump \"will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\" Orient, who designed the survey, said it was not asking members to diagnose Clinton. \"We were just asking whether they thought the concerns that had been raised were serious or not,\" she said. She said members weren't asked about Trump because he hasn't been accused of having serious physical problems. The AAPS news release makes no reference to only offering the survey to its members, so it\u2019s not entirely surprising that the bloggers would omit this detail, too. When we asked Orient about that significant omission, she said via email, \"This is what the press release said: 'Nearly 71 percent of 250 physicians responding to an informal internet survey by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS).' No other claims were made for it.\""

Taking a look at the numbers O\u2019Rourke spokesman Chris Evans said his figures came from a January news release from the city of El Paso that looked at the annual number of murders per year in El Paso over the past 59 years \u2014from 1960 to 2018. During that time period, the year with the most murders was 1993, when 56 murders were recorded in the city. The next closest year was 1980, when there were 54 murders. In 1964 and 2010, there were just five murders in the city. In 1965, there were nine murders, the only other year over this period when the total number of murders was in the single digits. Over the entire 59-year period included, the city averaged 23 murders per year. Over the past 10 years, from 2008 to 2018, El Paso averaged 18.1 murders per year. O\u2019Rourke frequently touts crime figures from El Paso to say that the city is among the safest in the country. The FBI cautions against using its uniform crime statistics to rank localities and researchers warn against ranking communities by relative safety. Without ranking localities, FBI data shows that El Paso\u2019s violent crime rate has been significantly lower than the average for all localities of a similar size (those with a population between 500,000 and 999,999 people) every year from 1985 until 2017, the latest available year from the FBI."

    "doc": "Speaking Oct. 21, 2011 in Plymouth, New Hampshire, Vice President Joe Biden did not confirm the death of former Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi, even as rumors of his death were flying. But the vice president was happy to credit the Obama administration with a job well done.\"In this case, America spent $2 billion total and didn\u2019t lose a single life,\" Biden told an audience at Plymouth State University. \"This is more the prescription for how we deal with the world going forward than we have in the past,\" he said, arguing that the cost of the operation in Libya was low, both in lives and dollars, compared to other military operations. Biden is right about the fatalities. Few American soldiers set foot in Libya during the seven-month campaign, led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and certainly no fatalities were reported, according to Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Elizabeth Robbins.But is he correct about the $2 billion figure? We decided to take a look.Reached for comment, Biden\u2019s office conceded that the vice president\u2019s numbers were on the high side, saying that he wanted to leave room for spending that might not be accounted for.Instead, the VP\u2019s office deferred to the Department of Defense, which reports that total spending for the Libya intervention reached $1.1 billion through September 30, 2011.The Pentagon\u2019s estimate covers the costs of daily military operations, munitions used, humanitarian assistance and the draw-down of supplies, according to Robbins, the department spokeswoman. But that figure likely doesn't include diplomatic and intelligence operations, among other costs absorbed by the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and other federal agencies, according to military analysts and academics.In most military engagements, the U.S. State Department absorbs some costs, including jet fuel for travel to meetings, among other diplomatic efforts, according to John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, an online security information database. \"Any place that you are aware of that has uniformed military personnel, there were State Department personnel involved in getting them into it,\" Pike said.Further, the CIA. regularly conducts classified intelligence missions that are often not included in Pentagon estimates, Pike said.These costs, among others associated with military efforts, are nearly impossible to track. Neither the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Accountability Office nor the White House Office of Management and Budget monitor these numbers, according agency media relations representatives. And the North Atlantic Treaty Organization does not differentiate costs by country, according to a NATO spokesman.Even if there are many peripheral costs, however, they pale in comparison to the Defense Department totals, according to analysts.The operational costs of war are typically so high -- $330 billion so far in Afghanistan and $708 billion in Iraq, according to Pentagon estimates -- that diplomatic, intelligence and other supplementary costs barely make a drop in the budget, according to Todd Harrison, senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a public policy research institute in Washington, D.C.\"There could be additional costs to the operation outside the DoD budget. \u2026 However, these costs are likely to be small relative to the military costs of the operation,\" Harrison wrote in an email. \"I suspect they would only add a few percent to the total cost.\""

The number of cancellations in Kentucky is not 40 times higher than the number of signups for private plans and Medicaid coverage, but rather significantly lower. Therefore, the correct label for this claim is \"False\".",
    "doc": "Now that more than 8 million Americans have signed up for coverage under Obamacare, the White House has all but declared victory after the law\u2019s initially troubled rollout. But many of the law\u2019s critics continue to see the law as a disaster. A reader sent us a newsletter to constituents released by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a critic of the law and a potential presidential candidate in 2016. Here\u2019s an excerpt from the newsletter, which was dated May 2, 2014: \"Since the implementation of Obamacare, hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians have received cancellation notices from their current health care providers. For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage. Obamacare has been presented to the American people through twisted rhetoric, smoke and mirrors. Obamacare is not good for America and it certainly (is) not good for Kentucky. I would like (to) hear how Obamacare affected you, your family or your small business. Share your story by visiting mywebsite.\" The claim that leapt out at us was, \"For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage.\" Could that really be true? We took a look at the data. How many Kentuckians have received cancellation notices? Tracking cancellations isn\u2019t so easy, because cancellations are issued by private health insurance companies, and regulations differ in each state. The Associated Press assembled a comprehensive, 50-state look at Obamacare-related cancellations and concluded that, in Kentucky, 130,000 people received cancellation notices. Meanwhile, the Kentucky Department of Insurance has put the number at 168,000. So a reasonable number for cancellations in Kentucky is probably between 130,000 and 168,000. How many Kentuckians have signed up for Obamacare? The answer depends on your definition of \"Obamacare.\" The broader measure includes both signups for private insurance at the state-run Kynect insurance marketplace, as well as signups for Medicaid, the longstanding government-run health insurance program for the poor that Kentucky chose to expand under Obamacare. In late April 2014, the state announced that 82,795 Kentuckians had purchased private plans on Kynect and 330,615 others had qualified for Medicaid coverage, for a total of 413,410. Data from the federal Department of Health and Human Services that counts a few more weeks of signups had slightly higher numbers. Comparing the two numbers Using just these numbers, Paul is either wrong or very wrong. The smaller number -- private-insurance number of signups (82,795) -- is exceeded by the number of cancellations (up to 168,000), but at most, the discrepancy is only twice as big, not 40 times as big. But it\u2019s not clear that this is the right number to use. Paul\u2019s newsletter didn\u2019t only refer to private plans, and the Medicaid expansion was just as much a part of Obamacare as the marketplaces for private health insurance plans. So if you include both types of signups (413,410), then the combined Medicaid and private-insurance signups in Kentucky actually exceeded the number of cancellations by more than double. So Paul\u2019s claim is not just off-base, it\u2019s actually going in the opposite direction. In fact, the 40-times-higher claim is ridiculously off-base. If you take the smallest possible number of signups (82,795, counting just the new private plans) and multiply it by 40, you\u2019d need more than 3.3 million cancellations to make the math work. Yet as of 2011-12, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there were only about 2.2 million Kentuckians who had insurance that could even theoretically be canceled -- either insurance purchased individually or provided by employer. The remainder either had government-provided insurance such as Medicare or Medicaid or were uninsured. Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said that the number of employers who drop coverage in the future \"could be a real issue,\" but for the 2014 statistics, she said, Paul\u2019s calculation seemed \"wildly off base.\" Our inquiries to Paul\u2019s office were not returned."

    "justification": "The claim that Donald Trump's foundation \"took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself\" is true based on the evidence provided in the article. The Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold found through a review of 17 years of tax filings by the Donald J. Trump Foundation and interviews with over 200 individuals and groups who were listed as recipients of its gifts, that nearly all of the money in recent years has come from people other than Trump, with his most recent personal gift to the foundation's coffers dating from 2008. Fahrenthold also found two cases where Trump used his money from the charity to buy himself a gift, including the six-foot-tall painting of himself that Obama referenced in his speech. The auction for the painting was held in 2006 but the check wasn't cut until 2007, a year in which almost all of the money in the Trump Foundation was other people's money. Specifically, according to Fahrenthold's reporting, Trump himself gave $35,000 to the foundation that year, but other donors gave $4.055 million, primarily a single $4 million gift from Vince and Linda McMahon, the founders of the WWE wrestling empire. Using the most generous calculation, Trump's own money accounted for less than 1% of the total amount that entered the foundation that year, $4,094,238. Therefore, it can be concluded that the claim is true based on the evidence provided in the article.",
    "doc": "President Barack Obama went to Philadelphia on Sept. 13 to campaign for Hillary Clinton, who was recovering from pneumonia. In his speech, Obama didn\u2019t hold back in his critique of Clinton\u2019s opponent, Donald Trump. In one particularly vivid line, Obama took a shot at Trump\u2019s foundation, contrasting it with the Clintons\u2019 foundation, which focuses on improving global health. The Clinton Foundation has been attacked by critics for taking money from donors who might have business before a future President Clinton. But Obama was having none of it. \"You want to debate foundations and charities?\" Obama said. \"One candidate's family foundation has saved countless lives around the world. The other candidate's foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself.\" Obama added, to laughter, \"I mean, you know, he had the taste not to go for the 10-foot version, but\u2026\" We have previously written about how the Clinton Foundation helped 9 million people receive lower-cost HIV/AIDS medicine, as well as the foundation\u2019s controversies. But what about Obama\u2019s statement that Trump\u2019s foundation \"took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself\"? The White House confirmed that the statement stems from a widely read Washington Post story by reporter David Fahrenthold, who\u2019s written a series of stories aboutTrump Foundation and has inquired with organizations around the country to see if they actually received money from the real estate mogul. Fahrenthold provided new details of his investigations in a Sept. 10, 2016, Post article headlined, \"How Donald Trump retooled his charity to spend other people\u2019s money.\" Based on a review of 17 years of tax filings by the Donald J. Trump Foundation and interviews with more than 200 individuals and groups who were listed as recipients of its gifts, Fahrenthold found that \"nearly all\" of its money in recent years has come from people other than Trump, with his most recent personal gift to the foundation\u2019s coffers dating from 2008. Experts told Fahrenthold that such an arrangement \"is almost unheard of for a family foundation.\" The story by Fahrenthold includes the anecdote referenced by Obama in Philadelphia, which Fahrenthold wrote was one of two cases he found in which Trump used his money from the charity to \"buy himself a gift.\" By doing so, he wrote, the foundation appeared to be flouting IRS rules by buying items that only seemed to be for Trump\u2019s benefit. \"In 2007, for instance, Trump and his wife, Melania, attended a benefit for a children\u2019s charity held at Mar-a-Lago. The night\u2019s entertainment was Michael Israel, who bills himself as \u2018the original speed painter.\u2019 His frenetic act involved painting giant portraits in five to seven minutes \u2014 then auctioning off the art he\u2019d just created. \"He painted Trump. \"Melania Trump bid $10,000. \"Nobody tried to outbid her. \" \u2018The auctioneer was just pretty bold, so he said, \"You know what just happened: When you started bidding, nobody\u2019s going to bid against you, and I think it\u2019s only fair that you double the bid,\" 'Israel said in an interview last week. \"Melania Trump increased her bid to $20,000. \" \u2018I understand it went to one of his golf courses,\u2019 Israel said of the painting. \"The Trump Foundation paid the $20,000, according to the charity that held the benefit.\" Fahrenthold\u2019s article notes that the Post submitted detailed questions to the campaign but officials declined to comment. The campaign did not respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact for this article. We asked Fahrenthold whether Obama\u2019s version jibed with his reporting. \"It seems pretty accurate to me,\" Fahrenthold told PolitiFact. \"I talked to both the charity that held the auction and the artist who made the painting. They told me Melania Trump had actually been the one bidding on the painting at the auction, which she won for $20,000 -- half went to charity, half went to the artist. But the actual check came from the Trump Foundation, of which Donald is president and Melania is not an officer of any kind.\" He added that the auction seems to have been held in 2006 but the check wasn\u2019t cut until 2007, a year in which \"almost all of the money in the Trump Foundation was other people\u2019s money.\" Specifically, according to Fahrenthold\u2019s reporting, the Trump Foundation began that year with $4,238 in the bank. Trump himself gave $35,000 to the foundation that year. But other donors gave $4.055 million, primarily a single $4 million gift from Vince and Linda McMahon, the founders of the WWE wrestling empire. Using the most generous calculation, Fahrenthold said, Trump\u2019s own money accounted for less than 1 percent of the total amount that entered the foundation that year, $4,094,238. \"So it was almost all other people\u2019s money,\" he said. So where is the painting? That\u2019s a bit more mysterious. Even crowdsourcing the search through Twitter hasn\u2019t produced a verified image of the painting. \"I can\u2019t find the damn thing,\" Fahrenthold said. \"It\u2019s out there somewhere. Neither the painter nor the charity -- the Children's Place at Home Safe, in Boca Raton, Fla. -- have been able to provide a picture of it.\""

    "doc": "It is a favored line among Republican candidates to charge their Democratic opponents with cutting Medicare. U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, leveled the attack at least four times in the first half hour of Wednesday\u2019s Florida U.S. Senate debate.Mack said incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson \"voted to cut $700 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare.\"PolitiFact has addressed this claim many times, in many ways, in many states.Obamacare refers to the Affordable Care Act. It does not literally cut funding from the Medicare program\u2019s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. We should note that the Republican plan championed by GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan also trims Medicare spending by almost exactly the same amount.The spending reductions fall largely on insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. The overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future, even with the health care law\u2019s cost-saving measures. The law tries to limit the program\u2019s growth, though, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget.  $716 billion The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $716 billion. Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. One impact of the law is it extends the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by eight years to 2024.There is a connection between the Medicare cost savings and the health care law. At the time the health care law was being finalized, Democrats said it was important that the new law not add to the deficit. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law\u2019s new spending.Some of the new spending goes toward Medicare recipients. It increases coverage for prescription drugs and offers preventive care at no cost to the patient. More significantly, though, the law moves to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. It also expands Medicaid, the state insurance program for the poor. The savings from Medicare offset that spending. The health law also imposes new taxes, primarily on the wealthy and on the health care industry. That, too, offsets the new spending."

    "doc": "Have Republican voters advanced a candidate for attorney general who tried to make abortion more accessible? Texas Right to Life said in a March 21, 2014, email blast about state Rep. Dan Branch of Dallas, \"In 2005, Branch tried to expand third-trimester abortions in Texas!\" The blast said the change \"would have endangered disabled, unborn babies.\" Well, it was an amendment to an amended amendment, and it would have provided an exception to an abortion restriction that didn\u2019t yet exist. Does that mean Branch \"tried to expand\" late-term abortions? Branch faces state Sen. Ken Paxton of McKinney in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the GOP nomination in the race to replace Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. Backup: An amendment to an amendment By email, Texas Right to Life legislative director John Seago pointed us to an amendment Branch offered May 16, 2005, as the House was considering Senate Bill 419 to maintain the state medical regulatory agencies. From the front of the House chamber, Republican Rep. Will Hartnett of Dallas put forward an amendment to the state\u2019s Occupations Code prohibiting third-trimester abortions \"when the abortion is not necessary to prevent the death of the woman.\" Hartnett\u2019s move--which won legislative approval and the backing of Republicans including Branch--amounted to a tightening of the existing state law, which barred third-trimester abortions unless the physician performing the abortion found the action \"necessary to prevent the death or a substantial risk of serious impairment to the physical or mental health of the woman; or the fetus has a severe and irreversible abnormality, identified by reliable diagnostic procedures.\" (That law was left in place, however, though the new restrictions superseded the old language due to a long-time legal provision stating that when laws are irreconciliable with one another, the law of more recent enactment prevails.) During House consideration of his proposal, Hartnett amended it to bar third-trimester abortions if \"the viable unborn child does not have a severe, irreversible brain impairment.\" Branch then proposed adding \"or vital organ\" after \"brain:\" Recapping: Hartnett\u2019s amended amendment would allow late abortions if a \"viable unborn child\" had irreversible brain damage. Branch\u2019s amendment, which Hartnett opposed, would have added another exception, allowing third-trimester abortions if the viable unborn child had irreversible damage to vital organs. Branch offers rationale not mentioned in '05 debate We sought to interview Branch about why he offered his amendment. Branch campaign spokesman Enrique Marquez told us via email that Branch \"was concerned that, by focusing arbitrarily on the brain, to the exclusion of the heart or lungs, the Legislature might give a court an excuse to question the rational basis of the law.\" Branch didn\u2019t explicitly mention potential court concerns in the House floor debate, according to the House\u2019s archived online video (debate on Branch\u2019s amendment starts at the 2:08:11 mark). But he repeatedly said it was rational to roll in irreversible vital organ damage if Hartnett\u2019s amendment already specified irreversible brain damage as an exception. Branch said, \"What this is merely attempting to do is to be intellectually honest with the fact that there are other vital organs besides the brain in a third-trimester fetus. That\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to do.\" Branch, saying he was \"strongly opposed as a general matter to third-trimester abortions,\" told the House, \"If you\u2019re going to have this exception for severe, irreversible brain damage, then my point is, as a son of a neurosurgeon, as a brother of a neurosurgeon, as someone who\u2019s lived through this with multiple children and multiple miscarriages, the term \u2018or vital organ\u2019 merely says that the heart -- it acknowledges that the heart or the lack of lungs or the kidney or the liver are all also vital organs in addition to the brain.\" Branch in debate: 'Pro-life position' After about 40 minutes of debate on his proposal, Branch said, \"I hope you understand I\u2019m coming from this in a pro-life position; I\u2019m really just trying to be careful and precise and intellectually honest. If we\u2019re going to make this exception for the brain, then we ought to include absolutely essential organs.\" Hartnett, moving to table Branch\u2019s proposal, told House members that \"vital organ\" was too broad: \"I just think ... we\u2019re getting into the posture of trying to water it down by drip, drip, erosion,\" he said. \"You can live without a kidney is my understanding, you can live without a lung, you can live without just about anything except your brain, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re drawing the line at the brain.\" The House tabled Branch\u2019s amendment before voting to adopt the Hartnett amendment and another that Hartnett offered requiring girls under age 18 to have a parent's permission before getting an abortion. In the end, both Hartnett measures were regarded as tightening abortion restrictions. News stories from May 17, 2005, described the amendments as abortion limits, including a Fort Worth Star-Telegram story that quoted Hartnett as saying, \"It's important for our (abortion laws) to be drawn tighter, rather than broader, to protect the children and to give these children an opportunity to be born.\" So Hartnett\u2019s measure tightened abortion limits; Branch\u2019s amendment would have added a second exception to one of them. Groups diverge Returning to the present day: In the Texas Right to Life email, Texas Eagle Forum leader Cathie Adams and state Rep. Jodie Laubenberg, R-Parker, author of abortion restrictions that the Republican-led 2013 Legislature approved, are quoted as saying Branch's amendment would have expanded access to abortion. On the other hand, Joe Pojman, executive director of Austin-based anti-abortion group Texas Alliance for Life (which endorsed Branch on April 11, 2014), told us by email that his organization regards it as \"as highly misleading and disingenuous\" to say Branch tried to expand late-term abortions. Pojman said neither Hartnett\u2019s fetal brain-damage exception nor Branch\u2019s vital-organ exception would have expanded third-trimester abortions because the existing restrictions -- which lawmakers left in place -- didn\u2019t significantly limit late abortions. \"Third-trimester abortions were effectively legal in Texas in 2005\" because of the mother\u2019s-mental-health clause, he said."

The evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim.\n\nFirstly, the chart provided in the article shows that the number of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood has essentially held steady, with marginal increases and a modest peak in 2009. This contradicts the claim that in 2013, there were more abortions than in 2006.\n\nSecondly, the article states that medical experts pointed to changing guidelines for Pap smears, the screening test for cervical cancer, as the reason for the decline in cancer screenings and preventive services provided by Planned Parenthood. This suggests that the decrease in non-abortion services is not due to an increase in abortions, but rather a change in medical guidelines.\n\nThirdly, the article provides data on the number of services provided by Planned Parenthood from 2006 to 2013, which shows that while abortions have remained steady, other services such as STI/STD testing and treatment have increased by 50 percent since 2006. This further contradicts the claim that Planned Parenthood prioritizes abortions over other services.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim that in 2006, Planned Parenthood performed more prevention services and cancer screenings than abortions, but in 2013, there were more abortions, is false.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, sparred with Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards during a high-profile hearing on Sept. 29. One of their face-offs originated with a chart Chaffetz flashed, indicating that Planned Parenthood performed more abortions than \"life-saving procedures\" in 2013, a complete reversal from just seven years ago. The chartfeatures a pair of lines crossing \u2014 one headed upward (abortions) and the other headed downward (cancer screening and prevention services). When referring to the chart in the hearing, Chaffetz said, \"In pink, that's the reduction in the breast exams, and the red is the increase in the abortions. That's what's going on in your organization.\" \"This is a slide that has never been shown to me before,\" Richards responded. \"Excuse me, my lawyer is informing me that the source of this is actually Americans United for Life, which is an anti-abortion group. So, I would check your source.\" \"Then we will get to the bottom of the truth of that,\" Chaffetz agreed. Many news outlets characterized the chart as misleading, so we too wanted to get to the bottom of the truth. As it turns out, Richards\u2019 lawyer was correct about the source of the chart -- it comes from an Americans United for Life web post from June 2015. The chart, we found, gives a misleading impression. The numbers listed on the chart are based on actual statistics, but they are small and were hard to read during the televised hearings. The chart\u2019s most prominent feature \u2014 the much larger crossed arrows \u2014 suggests a conclusion that\u2019s flat wrong. We reached out to Chaffetz\u2019s office but did not hear back. A spokesperson for Americans United for Life told PolitiFact that the graphic is accurate and honest. Experts, however, begged to differ. \"That graphic is a damn lie,\" said Alberto Cairo, who researches visual communication at the University of Miami. \"Regardless of whatever people think of this issue, this distortion is ethically wrong.\" Dueling axes Chaffetz\u2019s chart falls into a category known as a dual-axis chart. On the left side, cancer screenings and prevention services are plotted in the millions. On the right side, abortions are plotted in the hundreds of thousands. But the way the chart was assembled is problematic. For starters, dual-axis charts are particularly susceptible to showing spurious correlations. With two axes, trend lines can be exaggerated and manipulated, as most people ignore the axis labels that put the numbers in context. \"It forces your brain to see a relationship that isn\u2019t there,\" Cairo said. \"As economist Gary Smith once said, \u2018If you double the axes, you can double the mischief.\u2019 \" Second, it\u2019s even more inappropriate to use a dual-axis chart when comparing equivalent measures (in this case, the number of services performed by Planned Parenthood) using different scales, said Enrico Bertini, a professor at New York University who studies data visualization and who called the chart \"scandalous.\" Typically, dual-axis charts are used to compare lines that represent different things \u2014 \"for instance, abortion rates and cost,\" said Bertini. \"But in this case the unit is the same.\" \"You cannot put two measures, one in the millions and one in the hundreds, without making it explicit,\" Cairo said. \"We map data into visual properties \u2014 height, length, color \u2014 but we need to keep the proportions. We cannot force the data to adopt a shape we like.\" Finally, perhaps the most egregious decision was to not label the axes. Experts told us that, given this decision, they cannot rule out purposeful deception. \"By claiming to combine these two lines into one graph and then omitting the y-axis, we are being misled into to making a false comparison of two non-equivalent contexts,\" said Noah Iliinsky, a visualization and information designer based in Seattle. \"The graph is absolutely misleading, and intentionally so.\" Iliinsky also said he saw \"propagandized design choices\" in the choice of the arrowheads, which suggest a \"strong continuation of these trends, which we don\u2019t know to be true.\" Corrected charts With guidance from the experts, we compiled the number of abortions and cancer screenings/prevention services from Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual reports from 2006 to 2013 (we could not find a report from 2008). Here\u2019s what the chart should look like: As you can see from the chart, the number of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood has essentially held steady, with marginal increases and a modest peak in 2009. It is true, however, that the organization now provides fewer cancer screenings and preventive services, though medical experts said that\u2019s more likely due to changing health guidelines than the organization prioritizing abortions. Spokespersons for Planned Parenthood and for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both pointed to changing guidelines for Pap smears, the screening test for cervical cancer. Medical groups used to recommend an annual Pap, but now suggests the test every three or five years for most women. Planned Parenthood also provides an array of other services such as STI/STD testing and treatment \u2014services that have gone up by 50 percent since 2006 \u2014as well as pregnancy tests. Here\u2019s how all of the services have changed from 2006 to 2013: < A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood told PolitiFact that the number of services provided in each category tend to fluctuate from year to year for myriad reasons, ranging from changes in laws and medical practices to the opening or closure of Planned Parenthood clinics. Megan Christin, a spokesperson for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, speculated that the decline in contraception could be due to a growth in the use of IUDs, which last for five to eight years. Overall, if we compare abortions and non-abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood \u2014and if we use standard scales on the axes, we see largely consistent trend lines for both:"

    "doc": "Among the flurry of policies President Donald Trump put in force in his first week was to reimpose a ban on taxpayer dollars going to overseas groups that have anything to do with abortion. The so-called Mexico City policy was born under President Ronald Reagan and since then, with partisan regularity, Republican presidents invoke it and Democratic ones reject it. On the Senate floor, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., warned that Trump\u2019s version was even more extreme than those of his GOP predecessors. \"Previously, under President Reagan and the Bush administrations, this policy applied only to family planning funding,\" Shaheen said. \"But under President Trump's order, it applies to every program that falls under global health assistance. This means that it puts at risk 15 times more funding and millions more women and families.\" We compared the policies of all four Republican presidents and found that on paper, Shaheen\u2019s number is largely correct, but there\u2019s uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s policy. The first Mexico City policy Reagan administration officials announced a new U.S. family planning policy at the 1984 International Conference on Population in Mexico City. It required all nongovernmental organizations, foreign and domestic, receivingaid from the United States to agree that they would not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other countries. This applied to U.S. family planning programs run by the U.S. Agency for International Development. President George H. W. Bush left the Reagan policy in place.President Bill Clinton rescinded it, andPresident George W. Bush brought it back with the focus still on family planning through the U.S. Agency for International Development. But in 2003, Bush expanded the reach of the policy, instructing the secretary of state to apply it to \"all assistance for voluntary population planning.\" Even as he did that, Bush excluded a number of groups and programs. \"Such organizations do not include multilateral organizations that are associations of governments,\" Bush wrote. \"This policy shall not apply to foreign assistance furnished pursuant to the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003.\" With those words, Bush exempted some of the largest and highest profile global health programs. Those programs, experts told us, dwarfed any other programs at the State Department that Bush\u2019s order might have affected. Trump\u2019s presidential memorandum to reinstate the Mexico City policy is broader. In addition to the head of USAID, it is addressed to the departments of State and Health and Human Services. \"I direct the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to the extent allowable by law, to implement a plan to extend the requirements of the reinstated Memorandum to global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies.\" The operative phrase is \"global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies.\" Trump\u2019s order provides no exceptions. It\u2019s unclear exactly how the Trump administration will interpret those words. We asked the White House press office for details and did not hear back. The experts we reached told us they too were in the dark. Comparing family planning and global health programs The pipeline of family planning and global health programs is more complicated than you might expect. Governments agencies often contract with nonprofits which in turn subcontract out to smaller organizations in countries around the world. Jennifer Kates, director of global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said this makes it difficult to know the real impact of the order. \"Not all of the organizations that directly or indirectly receive U.S. government global health support carry out the activities prohibited by the policy, but figuring that out will take some time,\" Kates told us. However, Kates said that in theory, Trump\u2019s policy puts a lot more funding on the line. \"Whereas family planning assistance represents about $600 million per year, global health funding overall is close to $10 billion,\" Kates said. Data gathered by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation allows us to tease out exactly which programs Bush exempted from the Mexico City policy, but that Trump has included (see this IHME data graphic). Remember, Bush kept money for HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis off the table, as well as U.S. support for programs involving multiple nations, the big ones being the Global Fund and United Nations programs. Add all of those up and you get $9.7 billion. That\u2019s about 15 times as much money as the United States spends on family planning, which was the core program affected across all three previous Republican administrations. Shaheen said millions of women and families might be affected. In spending, the single largest global health program is the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. According to the latest report to Congress, PEPFAR treated 9.5 million people in 2015, at a cost of about $6.8 billion. Trump, along with his Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, has voiced support for PEPFAR. But in theory, since many HIV/AIDS programs include a family planning component, the programs that touch those people might be affected by Trump\u2019s Mexico City policy. If the policy extends to malaria programs, the numbers climb dramatically. In 2015, American dollars protected over 16 million people with indoor spraying and many more through the distribution of nearly 30 million bed nets."

    "doc": "Republican Eric Esshaki, a former nurse, is vying to unseat incumbent Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Rochester Hills, in Michigan's 11th congressional district, which she flipped from red to blue in 2018. In an ad, Esshaki attacks Stevens on health care, promising to stop her plan for \"socialized medicine.\" \"She\u2019d eliminate 100,000 doctors and nurses,\" the ad says. The evidence Essahaki\u2019s campaign cites comes from a report funded by a group lobbying against Medicare for All that makes problematic assumptions to support its analysis. While some progressive Democrats are pushing for a single-payer system to replace private insurance, others are calling for a public option, a government-sponsored program that would be available alongside private plans through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges. Stevens has publicly been on both sides of this divide, but her latest position is in favor of the public option. At the time Esshaki\u2019s campaign produced the ad, Stevens had already moved away from Medicare for All, campaigning instead on a public option. Although her stance on Medicare for All has shifted over time, she told PolitiFact Michigan she does not support Medicare for All. What\u2019s the difference between Medicare for All and a public option? Medicare for All would create a single, national health insurance plan supported by payroll taxes that would cover every American, mostly eliminating private health insurance. Under public option proposals, by contrast, Americans would have the choice of a government health plan in addition to private insurance options. Some critics argue this would inevitably lead to a single-payer national system if private insurers aren\u2019t able to compete with the government\u2019s prices and quality. But advocates of a public option have differing ideas of the role it would play in the health care system. Those who support a modest version envision the public plan as a kind of last resort for those who cannot find affordable private insurance, while others see it as a transitional step toward Medicare for All. Would Stevens\u2019 health care plan eliminate 100,000 doctors and nurses? Esshaki bases his claim that Stevens\u2019 health care plan would eliminate 100,000 doctors and nurses on a report published this year by FTI Consulting, a global consulting firm with offices around the world, that projects a loss of nearly 45,000 physicians and 1.2 million nurses by 2050 under Medicare for All. The report was funded by Partnership for America\u2019s Health Care Future (PAHCF), a group of medical professionals, hospitals, health insurers and pharmaceutical companies lobbying against Medicare for All and public option proposals. The report notes that countries where physicians are paid more have more physicians. The FTI analysis then assumes that Medicare payment rates would remain constant under Medicare for All, and looks at how a decline in incomes would affect the supply of physicians in the U.S. But \"the relationship between physician salaries and physician supply is an association and not necessarily causal\" warns Joelle Abramowitz, a University of Michigan economist. Meanwhile, \"the calculation assumes that all other components of Medicare as it is currently implemented for seniors will remain the same under Medicare for All, which is likely not the case,\" Abramowitz said. Esshaki\u2019s campaign shared another report with PolitiFact Michigan that found that a public option would eliminate the jobs of 420,000 health care employees. This report was also funded by PAHCF and assumes that a public option would reimburse health care providers at current Medicare rates. It does not specify how many doctors and nurses are included in this figure. Robert Pollin, an economist at the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst told Kaiser Health News that Medicare for All would entail significant job losses. \"Every proponent of Medicare for All \u2014 including myself \u2014 has to recognize that the biggest source of cost-saving is layoffs,\" he said. But experts predict most of the job losses under Medicare for All would be in the health insurance industry, such as insurance brokers, medical billing workers and other administrative roles. Some argue that Medicare for All, by decreasing the number of uninsured Americans, would increase demand for health care providers, including doctors, physician assistants and nurses. Stevens supports a public option over Medicare for All During her 2018 campaign, Stevens advocated for Medicare for All. In a June 2018 tweet she wrote, \"Medicare for all. NOW.\" That same month, during a candidate forum, the former Obama administration official said, \"We absolutely need to propose legislation to provide Medicare for All.\" This did not remain her position for long. A month before she won her seat, BuzzFeed reported Stevens supports a voluntary public option instead of Medicare for All. In a debate days before she was elected, Stevens said, \"I think that Medicare for All is a place where we can grow and go into, but for right now we need to focus on the cost of prescription drugs.\" A Medium article written by a member of Michigan for Single Payer in early 2019 notes Stevens has \"said in private\" that she supports a Medicare for All bill \"but has not done so publicly.\" Stevens has not co-sponsored Medicare for All bills late introduced in the current Congress. Back on the campaign trail, Stevens has said she supports a public option instead of Medicare for All. \"We need to work together to fix the Affordable Care Act (ACA), not dismantle it,\" her website reads. When asked to clarify her stance on Medicare for All, Stevens told PolitiFact Michigan, \"I do not support Medicare for All. I believe we can expand and improve on the Affordable Care Act to achieve the goal I have spent my life fighting for: the right for every American to have healthcare.\""

The evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim.\n\nFirstly, the article mentions that there are two clinics in El Paso that provide cervical cancer screenings, Reproductive Services of El Paso and Hill Top Women\u2019s Reproductive Clinic. This means that women in El Paso do have access to cervical cancer screenings within their own city, and therefore would not need to drive 550 miles each way to San Antonio for such services.\n\nSecondly, the article quotes Adriana Valdes, co-director of outreach and case management at the Cancer and Chronic Disease Consortium, who states that there are many organizations and institutions in El Paso that provide access to cervical cancer screenings and diagnostic services. Valdes also mentions that her organization manages El Paso clinics' participation in the state's Breast and Cervical Cancer Services program, which provides low-cost or free screenings to women in need.

    "doc": "The Texas Democratic Party sent out an email blast July 3, 2013, seeking signatures on a petition calling (ultimately without success) for hearings to be held around the state on a legislative measure tightening restrictions on abortion in Texas. Signed by party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, the letter said, \"If this bill passes, someone living in El Paso would have to drive 550 miles each way to San Antonio for something as simple as cervical cancer screening at a clinic.\" House Bill 2, which a House committee approved the day Hinojosa\u2019s email went out and was awaiting Senate consideration as we posted this article, would ban most abortions after 20 weeks and toughen standards for abortion clinics. Opponents have said a provision that clinics must upgrade to the standards of ambulatory surgical centers could lead 36 of 42 clinics that perform most Texas abortions to shut down. When we contacted the Democratic Party about Hinojosa\u2019s claim, spokeswoman Tanene Allison told us by email that although the chairman\u2019s San Antonio reference could be read as saying no El Paso facility would continue to provide such services, it was not intended that way. Hinojosa \"does recognize that there may be other clinics open for these screenings in El Paso,\" Allison said. \"Our intention was to say that if you go to the clinics that are covered under HB2, you would have to drive 550 miles to get some of the services that you normally get locally,\" Allison said. \"We certainly could have been clearer and will be in future emails.\" Still, we checked on conditions in El Paso for ourselves. El Paso, a city with 672,538 residents as of 2012, is at Texas\u2019 western edge, but it\u2019s not isolated. It\u2019s across the Rio Grande from the more than 1 million residents of Mexico\u2019s Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, and inside the U.S., it\u2019s closer to Albuquerque, N.M. (population 555,417) and the nation\u2019s sixth-largest city (Phoenix, population 1.5 million) than it is to San Antonio. Two El Paso clinics could shutter if the measure becomes law, according to a July 10, 2013, El Paso Times news story. The clinics appear on a Department of State Health Services list of abortion facilities we received by email June 25, 2013. Reproductive Services of El Paso, near downtown, provides cancer screenings and other services, while Hill Top Women\u2019s Reproductive Clinic solely offers abortions and pregnancy tests, according to the clinics\u2019 websites. We called both clinics, but did not hear back. So, if Reproductive Services were to shut down, would El Paso women have to drive 550 miles to get a test for cervical cancer? \"That\u2019s unbelievable. That\u2019s not possible. I don\u2019t even know where to start,\" said Adriana Valdes, co-director of outreach and case management at the Cancer and Chronic Disease Consortium, which manages El Paso clinics\u2019 participation in the state\u2019s Breast and Cervical Cancer Services program. \"There are a lot of organizations and institutions here that can provide access to those services,\" Valdes told us by phone. Lawmakers \"need to put all the facts together\" before making decisions that could affect funding for women\u2019s health \"coming into needy communities like ours,\" she said. \"Many towns and hospitals are committing their monies to diagnostic screenings and diagnostic services and none of them are providing abortion services.\" Valdes said she was not aware of the two clinics listed as abortion facilities, but said that any time a facility closes, it has a big impact on the women in the area who rely on its services. \"We have central locations,\" she said. \"Those are not long distances.\" Access to transportation is a concern, she said, but the biggest issue can be making sure women know the services are available, especially with patients who get used to going to a single facility for years and don\u2019t know of other options. Education and advice for such women is a main function of her organization, which subcontracts with 12 to 14 clinics and some private health care providers to help women get breast and cervical cancer screenings at low or no cost, Valdes said, and gives ongoing assistance to women diagnosed with cancer. The clinics do not provide abortions, she said, and so would not be directly affected by the legislation, although it could mean more women would seek their \"already overwhelmed\" services. Access to cervical cancer screenings in El Paso decreased when Planned Parenthood clinics in El Paso closed, we learned from Valdes and Theresa Byrd, a professor at Texas Tech University\u2019s Paul L. Foster School of Medicine in El Paso. According to the 2013 El Paso Times news story and another from June 27, 2009, all six Planned Parenthood clinics in El Paso closed in 2009 because of financial problems. Byrd, who helped develop a intervention program being tested now in El Paso and other cities to increase the prevalence of cervical cancer screenings among Mexican American women, told us that if the abortion measure became law, \"the situation would stay about the same\" in El Paso regarding cervical cancer screening. That is, such tests would still be available. Byrd said, \"In El Paso, is it easy to get service? No. You might have to wait, and it\u2019s probably not as easy as it would be in other communities\" such as Houston. \"But can you get them? Yes.\" For women who have health insurance, Byrd said, the path starts with a visit to the obstetrician/gynecologist or family doctor. \"So many women in our community are uninsured that many of them use our federally qualified health centers,\" she said, naming El Paso\u2019s three major providers in the state program: Centro San Vicente, Project Vida and Centro de Salud Familiar La Fe. Three or more health fairs held each year in El Paso also offer screenings, Byrd said, and cervical cancer tests are available in Ju\u00e1rez as well. Among health care options in El Paso is University Medical Center, which according to an online fact sheet is the largest public hospital on the U.S./Mexico border. Spokesman Jethro Armijo told us by phone that the hospital has seven outpatient clinics offering women\u2019s health care including cervical cancer screenings. The clinics do not offer abortions and are located throughout the county, he said."

    "doc": "President Barack Obama is playing an environmental joke on us, according to a video by progressive activist group Credo Action. This week, Obama traveled to Alaska to promote his climate change agenda. But some environmental activists see the visit as hypocritical, considering some of his other policy decisions, such as permitting oil drilling in the Arctic. To highlight what it sees as contradictory policies, Credo Action released an annotated version of a White House video promoting the Alaska trip. Credo\u2019s video says Obama\u2019s trip is antithetical to some of his own policies, including \"proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030.\" Credo is right that mining 10 billion tons of coal in quick order would more than negate any carbon reductions from Obama\u2019s EPA plan. There\u2019s just one problem: There\u2019s no proposal to mine 10 billiontons of coal. What proposal? Credo\u2019s source is a 2015 report by Greenpeace, another progressive environmental activist group. The report references the federal coal lease program, by which the government leases public lands to private companies for coal mining. The report said that a field office of the Bureau of Land Management in Buffalo, Wy., is proposing several new leases that would amount to 10.2 billion tons of coal. Greenpeace estimated that burning all 10.2 billion tons would result in almost 17 billion tons of carbon pollution. That dwarfs what the Environmental Protection Agency says Obama's Clean Power Plan will cut in carbon emissions. According to the EPA, the Clean Power Plan will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector by about 870 million tons annually by 2030. Greenpeace used a National Resources Defense Council estimate of the cumulative emission reductionsthrough2030 -- 5.3 billion tons. Greenpeace\u2019s carbon pollution calculation is reasonable, said Michael Mann, executive director of the Institute for Energy Studies at the University of North Dakota. Roughly 2.4 pounds of carbon are produced per pound of subbituminous coal (found in Wyoming) burned. The problem is that this 10.2 billion new tons of coal proposal is nonexistent. Greenpeace -- and others who have quoted this figure -- are distorting a single line buried in a 3,000-page report. In May 2015, the Wyoming field office released a resource management plan, which says the bureau \"has estimated that it would issue 28 coal leases encompassing 106,400 acres with approximately 10.2 billion tons of coal...over the next 20 years.\" But this is not a proposal or prediction. This is an outer-bounds estimate generated solely for the purposes of analysis, bureau spokeswoman Kristen Lenhardt told PolitiFact. The figures refer to the maximum amount of development possible within the 20-year lifespan of the resource management plan. The many regulatory steps that happen before land is offered for a coal lease, as well as shifts in market demand, would affect the actual amount of land available. \"It was not a plan for how much coal may, or may not be, leased in future years,\" she said. \"It is highly unlikely that actual development during the period of the plan will be anywhere close to this number of leases or acres.\" Also noteworthy is the fact that the resource management plan did not designate any new lands for coal lease consideration. These 106,400 acres identified by the report were already categorized as lands that could be available for mining. Even if this were a real proposal, Credo\u2019s timeline is unrealistic. It assumes that all 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal would be burned by 2030, which would require a staggering increase in coal use. The country has consumed around 1 billion tons of coal annually in recent years, and that\u2019s including coal produced all over the country, not just Wyoming. There are not nearly enough power plants in the country for this to work, Mann said. The United States has fewer than 520 coal-fired plants, and that number is on the decline. \"If we replaced all of the coal that is currently burned with this new coal from Wyoming, we still would not use that much coal,\" Mann said."

    "justification": "The claim \"Says the federal government hosted a conference and 'ordered 250 muffins at 16 bucks a piece.'\" is compatible with the evidence provided. The evidence states that the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General found that during a conference in August 2007, the government was billed $4,200 for 250 muffins at a cost of $16 each. This is the basis for Bill O'Reilly's claim that the federal government spent excessively on muffins at a conference.\n\nThe label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because while the evidence does indicate that the government was billed a significant amount for muffins, it does not provide enough information to determine if the cost of $16 per muffin is accurate or reasonable. The report notes that the hotel's headquarters issued a statement indicating that invoices sometimes do not fully reflect the services provided, which could suggest that the cost of the muffins may be higher than initially stated. Additionally, the inspector general's office responded to Hilton's statement with its own statement, indicating that even if the $4,200 fee included additional food and beverage items, the OIG believes that many individual food and beverage items listed on conference invoices and paid by the Department were very costly.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the evidence provided, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because while there is evidence to support the claim that the government was billed a significant amount for muffins at a conference, there is not enough information to determine if the cost of $16 per muffin is accurate or reasonable.",
    "doc": "The $16 muffin: It\u2019s just another piece of evidence that federal spending is out of control, according to pundit Bill O\u2019Reilly and others who have pounced on an inspector general's report as evidence of a wasteful Washington.O\u2019Reilly left his usual perch hosting The O\u2019Reilly Factor on Fox News to visit Jon Stewart, host of Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show. The announced topic was O\u2019Reilly\u2019s new book about Abraham Lincoln.But the segment quickly became two powerful pundits from opposite sides of the political spectrum debating the role of government in society.That, and trying to crack each other up.\"The $16 dollar muffin -- do we all know what the $16 muffin is?\" O\u2019Reilly said, looking around. Stewart hadn\u2019t heard, which seemed to delight O\u2019Reilly, while the audience guffawed.\"Look, $16 muffin,\" O\u2019Reilly explained. \"Broke the story last week on \u2018The Factor.\u2019 You were otherwise occupied, making your little wise remarks, not reading what\u2019s happening. They had a bunch of conferences for pin heads, the federal government\u2019s, and they ordered 250 muffins at 16 bucks a piece.\"\"That\u2019s a lot for muffins,\" Stewart said, playing the straight guy.\"Yeah!\" said O\u2019Reilly.The trouble with O\u2019Reilly\u2019s anecdote is that it\u2019s not entirely accurate.The $16 muffin started with a 122-page report released Sept. 20, 2011, from the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Inspector General. The report followed a 2007 audit that found few internal controls on conference spending, especially for food and beverages. New guidelines were issued, and this year\u2019s report was a check-up to see how the department was doing.Not so great, according to the recent report.\"All the conferences occurred at major hotels that applied service fees \u2013 usually around 20 percent \u2013 to the cost of already expensive menu items. Our assessment of food and beverage charges revealed that some DOJ components did not minimize conference costs as required by federal and DOJ guidelines. For example, one conference served $16 muffins, while another served Beef Wellington hors d\u2019oeuvres that cost $7.32 per serving,\" the report said.\"In our opinion, the lack of documentation we found regarding the necessity of costly food and beverage items indicated that not all sponsors were seriously questioning the need for expensive meals and refreshments at their events,\" it added.Media reports summarized the inspector general\u2019s overall negative findings, but couldn\u2019t resist starting with the $16 muffin. In fairness, it was a verbatim quote from the report.However, reading deeper into the report revealed that the $16 muffins were not completely a la carte. The department received some complimentary beverages and some fruit, though whether additional items were served at breakfast or at a later break is not quite clear.Justice Department officials also told the inspector general that they were provided the meeting space without charge, though the report notes it\u2019s departmental policy to use federal government meeting spaces whenever possible. And, the inspector general found that conference planners didn\u2019t do any kind of cost breakdowns to show that the government got a better deal overall when it purchased food and received free meeting space.The conference was held at the Capital Hilton Hotel in Washington in August 2007, and after the $16 muffin made headlines, the hotel\u2019s headquarters issued a statement saying that invoices sometimes don\u2019t fully reflect the services provided.\"Hilton has a long standing practice of working with government agencies to plan meetings and events that fall within their budgets,\" said the statement from Hilton Worldwide Corporate Headquarters. \"Dining receipts are often abbreviated and do not reflect the full pre-contracted menu and service provided, as is the case with recent media reports of breakfast items approved for some government meetings. In Washington, the contracted breakfast included fresh fruit, coffee, juice, and muffins, plus tax and gratuity, for an inclusive price of $16 per person.\"The Washington Post reported that if a person off the street went into the Capital Hilton Hotel and ordered pastries, coffee and a fruit plate, it would cost $29.15. That includes tax but no tip.The inspector general\u2019s office responded to Hilton\u2019s statement with its own statement:\"The $16 muffin was based on documentation obtained during the audit showing that the Department was invoiced by the Capital Hilton Hotel $4,200 including gratuity and service charge for 250 muffins. Although we made repeated attempts over several months to reach the Capital Hilton during the course of the audit to discuss its billing, it was not responsive to our numerous requests. Since our report was issued, the Capital Hilton has stated that other food and beverage items, such as coffee, tea, and fruit, were included in the charged amount, but did not provide any supporting documentation. Even if the $4,200 fee included additional food and beverage items, the OIG believes, as stated in our report, that many individual food and beverage items listed on conference invoices and paid by the Department were very costly.\""

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) donor lookup and a similar tool offered by the Center for Responsive Politics show seven donations made by Donald Trump to Clinton's presidential campaign, with a total amount of $17,000. However, the Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier stated that between Trump and his children, it is ten times the amount, indicating that the money donated by Trump's family members should be included in the count. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.\n\nThe evidence provided shows that Donald Trump made seven donations to Clinton's presidential campaign, with a total amount of $17,000.

Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.\n\nIt is worth noting that the evidence does not provide any information about the timing or circumstances of these donations, which could affect the interpretation of the data. Additionally, the article mentions that Trump's wife and children also made donations to Clinton's campaign, but it does not provide details on the amount or frequency of these donations.",
    "doc": "During the Republican presidential debate in Detroit, Ted Cruz went after Donald Trump by bringing up the real estate developer\u2019s past donations to the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton. Cruz said, \"Donald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once, not twice, not three times. Ten times. And four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. It wasn't that she was the New York senator and it was a cost of doing business. It was to her presidential campaign.\" We found that Cruz has a point that Trump has given multiple donations to Clinton, including to her presidential campaign. However, Cruz\u2019s count is too high, and with the presidential donations, there is less than meets the eye. (We aren\u2019t looking at Trump\u2019s donations to the Clinton Foundation.) We looked up donations by Trump both in the Federal Election Commission donor lookup and a similar tool offered by the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that tracks campaign contributions. Cruz\u2019s number -- 10 donations -- matches the number of donations that come up when searching the FEC site for donations by \"Donald Trump.\" However, searching that way lumps in donations made by Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. Weeding out the son\u2019s donations requires clicking into the scanned images of his donation disclosure forms. Here\u2019s a summary of the elder Trump\u2019s donations to Clinton: Date Amount Senate or presidential 05/01/2002 $1,000 Senate 03/23/2005 $1,000 Senate 09/30/2005 $900 Senate 12/02/2005 $1,000 Senate 11/01/2006 $200 Senate 11/12/2007 $600 Presidential 11/09/2009 $1,700 Presidential 11/10/2009 -$2,300 (refund) Presidential This data supports Cruz\u2019s general point that Trump has made multiple donations to Clinton over the years. But Cruz is off on the specifics in several ways. First, the number of total donations isn\u2019t 10, as Cruz said, but seven. The number of donations to her presidential campaign wasn\u2019t four, as Cruz said, but two. Second, the total amount of Trump donations to Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign were refunded in November 2009. Who requested this refund -- Trump or Clinton -- was not recorded in the documentation. Third, the timing of both Trump\u2019s biggest presidential donation and the refund is also curious. The money was not spent and refunded during the heat of the 2008 presidential primary campaign, when Clinton was running. Rather, the transactions came a full year after Barack Obama -- Clinton\u2019s primary rival -- had already been elected president. If we can learn any more about the circumstances of these donations and refunds, we will update this article. Members of Trump\u2019s immediate family also gave money to Clinton over the years. His wife, Melania, gave one donation of $2,000 to Clinton\u2019s Senate campaign in 2006. His daughter, Ivanka, gave three donations totaling $4,400 to Clinton\u2019s Senate campaign in 2006 and 2007. And Donald Trump Jr. gave three donations worth $6,100 in 2006 and 2007, minus a refund of $1,700 in 2008. On net, the younger Trump gave $2,100 in donations to Clinton\u2019s Senate campaign and $2,300 to her presidential campaign. Indeed, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told PolitiFact that \"between Trump and his children, it is 10times. It is all Donald Trump's money.\" However, we don't consider this money to be Trump's -- his wife and the children who donated are adults -- and Cruz didn't refer to Trump's family at large."

That\u2019s more than credit card debt\" as True. The evidence from various sources, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Reserve System, confirms that student debt has surpassed credit card debt in recent years.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's report, in the first three months of 2014, student loan debt totaled $1.1 trillion, while credit card debt hit $659 billion. This indicates that student debt is currently higher than credit card debt. Additionally, the evidence from the Urban Institute suggests that the increase in student debt during the Great Recession was due to more people going back to school because of the job situation, which further supports the claim.\n\nFurthermore, the statistic cited by Senator Mark Warner during his re-election stump speech, \"Right now, America has $1.1 trillion of student debt. That\u2019s more than credit card debt,\" is consistent with the data provided in the evidence. Therefore, based on the evidence presented, it is appropriate to label the claim as True.",
    "doc": "Sen. Mark Warner\u2019s re-election stump speech dwells on giving everyone an equal opportunity and high on that list is an affordable college education. Warner and many of his fellow Democrats have called for legislation that would ease student debt by allowing students to refinance their federal college loans at substantially lower interest rates and limit their loan repayments to 10 percent of their annual income. President Barack Obama endorsed those measures during a speech Monday.. Warner, during a recent speech of his own, said, \"Right now, America has $1.1 trillion of student debt. That\u2019s more than credit card debt.\" This statistic caught our attention, so we put it to the Truth-O-Meter. David Turner, spokesman for Warner\u2019s campaign, backed up the statement by sending us a speech by an official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and data from the Federal Reserve System. Both of those sources say that student debt has topped $1 trillion and the speech noted that it had surpassed credit cards. But the best data comes from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which publishes debt statistics every quarter. In the most recent report, covering first three months of 2014, student loan debt totaled $1.1 trillion, while credit card debt hit $659 billion. The largest type of debt for Americans is mortgages, which came in at $8.2 trillion in the first quarter. Student loan debt is No. 2, followed by automobile loans at $875 billion and credit card debt in making up $11.7 trillion in all debt. Student debt began to outpace credit card debt in the second quarter of 2010, when college loans hit $762 billion. Student debt topped the $1 trillion mark in the third quarter of last year. Average tuition across the nation increased 79.5 percent from 2003-2013, according to data from the U.S. Labor Department. For comparison, the Consumer Price Index grew by 26.7 percent during the same span and average wages grew by 30.1 percent. Credit card debt, by contrast, has gradually fallen from $843 billion in early 2009 to its $659 billion level this year. Much of the decrease occurred during the recession when people cut back on spending. But the recession exacerbated college debts, according to Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. She cited two reasons: \"You have to remember that during the time of the Great Recession, more people were going back to school because of the job situation, so they were taking on more debt,\" she said. A study she co-wrote tackled the demographics of people with student loan debt. It found that student loan debt, for those ages 29 to 37, had increased by $10,381 on average from 1989 to 2010, while car loans had increased $302, credit card debt had increased $1,215 and other debt had decreased $2,078. In 2012, 40 percent of Americans in their 20s had student debt, 30 percent in their 30s owed on student loans, 19 percent of Americans in their 40s, 12 percent in their 50s and 4 percent in their 60s. This included students and parents who borrowed to send their children to college."

    "justification": "The claim \"Nearly 45 percent of the women who receive health screenings through (the Women\u2019s Health Program) do so at a Planned Parenthood health center\" is appropriate because it provides a specific and accurate figure regarding the proportion of women in the program who receive services from Planned Parenthood clinics.

    "doc": "Speaking out against the exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from a Texas family planning program for low-income women, five Democratic legislators aired a statistic indicating that the group is a crucial provider. \"Nearly 45 percent of the women who receive health screenings through this program do so at a Planned Parenthood health center,\" said a commentary in the March 6, 2012, Austin American-Statesman by Austin state Reps. Elliott Naishtat, Dawnna Dukes, Eddie Rodriguez, Mark Strama and Donna Howard. We looked into that figure amid debate over the state\u2019s decision, which led the Obama administration to set in motion a phased-in cutoff of about $30 million in annual federal funds for the Texas Medicaid Women\u2019s Health Program, which has served tens of thousands of women a year since its launch in 2007. To participate in the program, providers may not perform elective abortions. Since the program\u2019s start, dozens of Planned Parenthood health centers in Texas have qualified because they don\u2019t provide abortions and are legally separated from Planned Parenthood clinics that do. That is changing, however. The Texas health and human services commissioner signed a rule in February 2012 barring entities affiliated with abortion providers from the program, which had the effect of disqualifying Planned Parenthood health centers that do not provide abortions. In response, the Obama administration declined to renew the program, arguing that Texas\u2019 new rule violates federal law by restricting women\u2019s abilities to choose their own caregivers. Perry has pledged to continue the program with state money \u2014 and without Planned Parenthood. Under the program, participating women may receive health screenings, including a Pap smear, during the one family planning exam per fiscal year that the program covers. Examples of other screenings, related to family planning, that women can get during their visit: breast exam, pregnancy test, routine urinalysis, as well as testing for diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases and high blood pressure. Screenings are not covered outside of the annual exam. The program also pays for birth control such as pills and condoms. Naishtat aide Nancy Walker told us by email that the \"nearly 45 percent\" figure came from \"multiple sources,\" including the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. She said the agency told her that in fiscal 2010, about 46 percent of clients in the state\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Program had received services from Planned Parenthood \u2014 which, we noticed, is a wider description than the legislators\u2019 reference solely to \"health screenings.\" Commission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman told us that the state has not compiled data on where women in the program receive health screenings. Asked about the figure that Naishtat\u2019s aide cited from the commission, Goodman told us that the figure is based on a data analysis for fiscal 2010 \u2014 Sept. 1, 2009, through Aug. 31, 2010 \u2014 showing that of the 106,711 women who were served by the program, 49,162 received a service from a Planned Parenthood clinic. That\u2019s 46.1 percent. We wondered, though, if it\u2019s correct to assume that all women in the program received health screenings, as the Democrats\u2019 article suggests. Goodman speculated that it might be, pointing out that all women in the program are entitled to an annual exam with health screenings. Also, the Democrats\u2019 article leaves the impression that the referenced women solely depended on Planned Parenthood clinics for their screenings. That might not be so. According to the commission\u2019s figures, 27,256 of the 49,162 Women\u2019s Health Program clients who were served by Planned Parenthood in fiscal 2010 also received a Women\u2019s Health Program service from a provider not linked to Planned Parenthood. In a previous fact-check, we laid out a couple of possible explanations for those women being served by both Planned Parenthood and another type of provider. For one, some portion of the 27,256 women may have had their exams and screenings at a Planned Parenthood clinic and then any tests processed at an outside lab. In those cases \u2014 and the state couldn\u2019t tell us how many of them there were \u2014 the only \"services\" that a woman would have received from a non-Planned Parenthood provider was lab testing. These women would not affect the Democrats\u2019 statistic, since they received their screenings at Planned Parenthood. But under the program, it\u2019s also possible for women to switch providers during the year and receive another exam and screenings. So some portion of the 27,256 women may have received screenings from both a Planned Parenthood and a non-Planned Parenthood provider during fiscal 2010. And if the number were large enough, the percentage of women in the program who received their screenings exclusively from a Planned Parenthood clinic would be smaller than 46 percent. Goodman told us the state has not teased out the detailed data that would settle this issue."

This further supports the claim that the worker never paid back the loan.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, the label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim made by Brendan Doherty in the article.",
    "doc": "EDITOR's NOTE: On Sept. 16, 2012, PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as Mostly False a statement by Republican congressional candidate Brendan Doherty that was directed at U.S. Rep. David Cicilline. Doherty said: \"The Providence Economic Development Partnership . . which you [Cicilline] chaired, loaned $103,000 in taxpayer funds to one of your campaign workers. The worker never paid back the loan.\" In light of additional evidence, we are changing our rating to Mostly True and providing this new analysis.Republican congressional candidate Brendan Doherty leveled a host of charges against his Democratic opponent U.S. Rep. David Cicilline one day after Cicilline\u2019s primary win.Among what Doherty called Cicilline\u2019s \"most serious deceptions\" was this claim directed at the former mayor: \"The Providence Economic Development Partnership ... which you chaired, loaned $103,000 in taxpayer funds to one of your campaign workers. The worker never paid back the loan.\"The borrower in question was Erasmo Ramirez, who worked on Cicilline\u2019s 2002 campaign. He was thrust into the public spotlight last month when he surfaced in an undercover video talking to an aide to Anthony Gemma, Cicilline\u2019s primary opponent. Ramirez is heard saying he manipulated absentee ballots when he worked for Cicilline\u2019s campaign and he could do the same for Gemma if he was put on the Gemma payroll.After the release of the taped solicitation, The Providence Journal published a story showing that the city\u2019s Economic Development Partnership program had given Ramirez a $103,000 loan in 2004 to help start a restaurant on Union Avenue.Cicilline spokesman Eric Hyers told The Journal at the time that the loan \"has been repaid in full.\"But Doherty\u2019s campaign cited an Aug. 30 story by GoLocalProv which reported Ramirez never paid back the loan.One campaign had the story wrong, so we decided to check the records ourselves.Minutes of the partnership\u2019s meetings show the development agency first approved loaning Ramirez $103,000 on Feb. 17, 2004. The loan was just one of several Ramirez had taken out for his proposed El Portal Family Restaurant, at 207 Union Ave. -- a project estimated to cost $706,000.To secure the loan, Ramirez offered up as his main collateral two other pieces of property he owned, but the project met immediate obstacles. On four separate occasions, between January 2005 and June 2006, Ramirez sought and received from the development agency permission to delay making loan payments. (He also requested a second, $65,000 loan, but was denied.)Ultimately the restaurant never opened. The city moved to foreclose on the restaurant property when Ramirez failed to pay his taxes. And on Sept. 8, 2006, real estate records show, the city sold the property at public auction. Westcott Development Inc. bought it for the amount owed in outstanding taxes: $10,485.22.But what about Ramirez\u2019s defaulted $103,000 loan?In our initial story, we said that Ramirez sold one of his collateral properties to cover the loan, a house at 529 Union Ave. But further investigation shows that the travel of that transaction was anything but that simple.Paperwork describing in detail what happened with that property was missing from the public files we examined at the Providence Economic Development Partnership. The agency\u2019s new lawyer, John Garrahy, told us Tuesday that a previous city attorney considered the documents private under attorney/client privilege and did not place them in the public file.Garrahy was reluctant to immediately turn them over to PolitiFact until he checked whether they were still considered private. But he explained over the phone that while the development agency did eventually receive a check for $96,016.74 to cover most of Ramirez\u2019s loan debt -- as PolitiFact reported Sunday -- the check did not come from Ramirez.As it turns out, when Ramirez sold the collateral property at 529 Union Ave., the title insurance company failed to discover the lien that the development agency had placed on it.The lien didn\u2019t come to light until the agency sought to foreclose on the property, which didn\u2019t make its new owner, Larry King, of Warwick, happy. He sued both Ramirez and the agency, alleging that he had been duped.Ultimately, in January 2007, the title insurance company paid the $96,000 to the development agency and King\u2019s complaint against the development agency was settled.As for King\u2019s complaint against Ramirez? King\u2019s lawyer Brian LaPlante told us Tuesday it wasn\u2019t pursued because Ramirez filed for bankruptcy.The development agency also waived the remaining $16,016.74 Ramirez owed it in interest, late fees and penalties."

The study cited only talks about \"a sort of domino effect,\" without providing detailed mechanisms for how aid leads to increased trade and job creation.\n2.

No other studies are mentioned that reach the same conclusion, suggesting that the claim may not be supported by more recent research.\n3. Limited scope: The study only looks at the impact of agricultural research on trade and employment in developing countries. It does not consider other factors that could affect the relationship between foreign aid and US jobs, such as changes in global market conditions or technological advancements.\n4. Caveats and qualifications: Several experts interviewed for the article express skepticism about Fan's claim, noting that the causal chain from aid to trade to job creation is complex and difficult to quantify. They also mention that the study cited has limitations in terms of its methodology and the assumptions it makes.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim may have been intended to highlight the potential benefits of foreign aid for agricultural research, the evidence provided does not provide a clear or convincing argument for a 4:1 return on investment in terms of trade and job creation in the US. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate.",
    "doc": "While the details are vague, foreign aid is on the chopping block in President Donald Trump\u2019s pending budget. Non-military assistance accounts for less than 1 percent of federal spending and defenders of aid would like to argue that it actually pays dividends to America. Shenggen Fan, the head of the International Food Policy Research Institute, a widely respected organization, said his group had a study showing very specific paybacks tied to aid. \"If we help the countries developing to invest in agriculture research, every $1 invested will bring $4 (in) trade with the countries and the United States,\" Fan said Feb. 2 at a meeting in Washington. \"So if you're investing in foreign aid, you\u2019re generating employment back in the U.S. It helps economic growth here in this country.\" Fan\u2019s office said he was referring to a 1996 article that described a sort of domino effect. Agricultural research leads to higher production, which in turn delivers economic growth and the extra income generates demand for more imports. \"When the flow of additional imports over time is taken into account, the $1 investment in agricultural research generates $4.39 of additional imports,\" the article said. That seems to back up Fan\u2019s point, but it terms of what it means for sales by American companies, he pushed the findings a little too far. The article specifically noted that there\u2019s no guarantee \"that a particular donor country captures the gains from the increase in exports.\" Put another way, an investment of $1 might spur $4 in trade, but there\u2019s no guarantee the original investor will be the one to benefit. Fan posted an item later that dialed back on the trade gains, writing that they would help \"economies like the United States or Germany.\" In addition, that study is 20 years old, and we could find no other study that reached the same conclusion. Fan\u2019s office cited a 2006 analysis from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. The center wanted to gauge the economic impact of the work it funded. It did find that research boosted trade, but for a number of reasons, that result didn\u2019t do much to bolster Fan\u2019s case. In the first case, the Australians defined trade gains broadly to include increased sales by Aussie firms to developed countries such as Japan. On top of that, they didn\u2019t find a 4-to-1 payback on trade. When we crunched their numbers, it was more like 1-to-1. The authors also warned that their dollar amounts were based on projected rather than actual benefits. \"It is possible that these benefits never actually emerged or that the benefits that did emerge were considerably greater,\" they wrote. We asked a number of researchers if they knew of any study that linked foreign aid for agricultural research to greater exports for American firms. Not one could think of such work. \"We are not aware of other quantitative estimates of a relationship between investment in agriculture in foreign countries and trade,\" Cheryl Christensen of the USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service told us. The consensus that emerged was that the domino effect Fan had in mind might take place in some countries, but no analysis had pulled all the pieces together. \"I believe that our foreign aid to agriculture is effective and can boost agricultural production and rural income in developing countries,\" Phillip Abbott, professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, told us. \"As countries grow, they may well -- many do -- need more food than they can produce themselves, and this leads to greater imports, including agriculture imports from U.S. agriculture. Turning this into a causal chain with a fixed multiplier, as claimed by Fan, is a stretch.\" Robert Paarlberg at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School said plenty of research ties aid to greater productivity and rising incomes. \"But it starts to become difficult when you look for links back to foreign aid, especially agricultural development aid,\" Paarlberg said. \"There the links remain plausible, at least in countries capable of using aid well, but they become too remote to estimate with any confidence.\""

The Hate Crime Statistics Act defines hate crimes as \"crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, gender and gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.\" There are two main programs for data collection on hate crimes in the United States: the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program and the National Crime Victimization Survey.\n\nThe FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program aggregates voluntary data from law enforcement agencies around the country, but it relies solely on crimes that are reported to the police. This program estimated 5,796 hate crime incidents in 2012, which is significantly lower than Brooks' claimed number of at least 200,000 to 300,000 hate crimes per year. However, the National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, asked nearly 160,000 people annually whether or not they have been victims of crime, including hate crimes. In 2012, the survey estimated that 293,800 hate crime victimizations occurred, which is in line with Brooks' statement.\n\nThere are several reasons why the FBI's data may underreport the number of hate crimes:\n\n1. Agency non-participation: Some states with high percentages of African-American victims have low participation rates in the UCR program.\n2. Lack of reporting: Local police officers may be incapable of properly identifying hate crimes when they are reported to them, leading to undercounting.\n3. Victim reluctance: Immigrants or other victims may be reluctant to report incidents to the police due to language barriers or cultural norms.\n4. Overcounting: The National Crime Victimization Survey may overcount the incidence of hate crimes as it simply asks victims whether or not they think they were targeted because of bias related to their membership in a protected category.\n\nBased on these factors, it is likely that the true number of hate crimes in the United States is closer to Brooks' claimed number than the FBI's estimated 5,796 incidents. Therefore, we label the claim as True.",
    "doc": "After the Charleston church shooting, residents of the South Carolina city came together to rally behind the families of the nine victims. One notable moment came during suspect Dylann Roof\u2019s arraignment, when a relative of one of the dead told him, \"You hurt me. You hurt a lot of people. But God forgives you. I forgive you.\" Some pundits see the response as proof that race relations in the United States are improving; others are more skeptical, with many pointing out that the number of hate crimes committed has remained stubbornly steady and worryingly high. NAACP President Cornell William Brooks falls firmly into the latter category. \"The level of hate crimes in this country has remained constant over years,\" he said on Face the Nation. \"We have to allocate resources to address these hate groups and these hate crimes. The fact of the matter is, the Justice Department underestimates the degree of hate crimes in this country because they have to rely on self-reporting. That is a challenge. And the fact that we have at least 200,000 to 300,000 hate crimes in a given year is unconscionable and inconsistent with our values as Americans.\" Brooks\u2019claim about the number of hate crimes surprised us, so we decided to see if we could confirm the number. Conflicting collections Written for the purpose of collecting statistics on the phenomenon, the Hate Crime Statistics Act defines hate crimes as \"crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, gender and gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.\" There are two main programs for data collection on hate crimes in the United States. The first is the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, known as UCR, which aggregates voluntary data from law enforcement agencies around the country. The agencies reported 5,796 hate crime incidents for 2012, much lower than the amount Brooks claimed. But the UCR program relies solely on crimes that are reported to the police. In an attempt to account for crimes not reported to the police, the federal government instituted the National Crime Victimization Survey in 1973. This household survey, currently conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, asks nearly 160,000 people annually whether or not they have been the victims of crime. In 2012, the survey estimated that 293,800 hate crime victimizations occurred, well in line with Brooks\u2019statement. So, what accounts for this surprising discrepancy? For one, the two methods simply approach the problem differently. The FBI program asks the police to report the number of hate crimes they have logged in a year, while the survey asks possible victims if they have experienced a hate crime. Beyond that, however, there are serious questions about how the methodology of each study affects its results. To begin with, the UCR program is generally considered highly susceptible to underreporting as a result of agency non-participation. \"There is a structural and institutional problem, which is that a lot of agencies aren\u2019t participating,\" said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University. \"For instance, states with the highest percentage of African-Americans are participating least in the program, but 31.3 percent of victims are African-American. They\u2019re the single largest group victimized.\" Levin also cited the unbelievably low numbers of reported hate crimes in states such as Alabama (six) and Mississippi (four) as proof that agencies frequently fail to aggregate and report the number of hate crime incidents they process. The FBI\u2019s participation rates further corroborate Levin\u2019s assertion. The Anti-Defamation League compiled a table from the FBI data showing that in 2013 there were 85 cities with populations greater than 100,000 that either reported no hate crimes, or failed to report at all: notable cities on the list include Miami, Tulsa, Tampa, and Honolulu. (Hawaii\u2019s police agencies have not reported a single incident in the past two years.) Furthermore, local police officers may be incapable of properly identifying hate crimes when they are reported to them. A study on crime classification errors by James Nolan of West Virginia University found that officers undercounted hate crimes by 67 percent. Finally, experts told us some victims are reluctant to report incidents to the police. Immigrants, for example, can oftentimes perceive the language barrier as insurmountable, while other victims have grown up in an environment where reporting a crime to the police is not socially acceptable. For its part, the National Crime Victimization Survey avoids many of these issues, since it simply asks victims of a crime whether or not they think they were targeted because of bias related to their membership in a protected category (those listed in the law). On the other hand, that means the survey may overcount the incidence of hate crimes; Levin suggests that respondents \"might be reporting biased incidents that aren\u2019t crimes, or crimes that they think are prejudice-related but aren\u2019t.\" Nevertheless, the general consensus among experts is that the survey numbers come much closer to telling the truth than the FBI reports."

    "justification": "The label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim that \"Israel cut its illegal immigration rate by 99% by constructing a 143-mile fence along its southern border.\" The evidence provided in the article supports this claim.\n\nFirstly, the article cites a specific number - 16,000 - for the number of people illegally crossing Israel's southern border in 2011, which decreased to less than 20 by 2016, a 99% decrease. This is a clear and concrete example of how the fence has reduced illegal immigration.\n\nSecondly, the article quotes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying that the fence has stopped all illegal immigration, which suggests that the fence has been successful in preventing illegal crossings.\n\nThirdly, the article mentions that President Trump has touted Israel's southern barrier and given a nod to Trump's own border wall initiative, indicating that he believes the Israeli fence is effective in reducing illegal immigration.\n\nFourthly, experts interviewed in the article acknowledge that the fence has been successful in reducing illegal immigration, but caution against generalizing that the fence is the sole reason for the drop in illegal crossings. They also highlight the importance of other factors such as the scale and heavily guarded nature of the border, which can affect the effectiveness of a wall or fence.\n\nBased on these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the construction of the 143-mile fence has indeed led to a significant reduction in illegal immigration into Israel. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "Need an example of a border wall that works? Look to Israel, President Donald Trump has repeatedly said. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., echoed the idea during a Feb. 3 CNN interview, claiming that a border fence in Israel has drastically cut illegal immigration along its southern border. \"Israel ... had a real problem with illegal immigrants coming in from the southern border, about 16,000 in one year. In two years, they constructed 143-mile fence, about $2.9 million per mile, and it cut that illegal immigration rate from about 16,000 to I think 18. Cut it by 99 percent,\" Johnson said. The United States needs to pay attention to Israel and how it has handled security issues, Johnson said. \"They are under a constant state of threat. Threat of terrorism. They've dealt with it pretty effectively. We need to learn those lessons,\" Johnson added. Since Trump has signed an executive order to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, we were curious about references to Israel\u2019s border efforts and their success, as described by Johnson. Here\u2019s what we found. Israel-Egypt border fence Israel has built multiple barriers along its borders with Egypt, Lebanon, Gaza Strip and West Bank, all as safeguards against terrorism and illegal immigration. In 2015, we looked into a claim from another Wisconsin official, Gov. Scott Walker, when he said that a 500-mile fence between Israel and the West Bank was to thank for a 90 percent reduction in terrorist attacks in Israel. Experts then told us that even though there had been a drop in terrorism, the data used for Walker\u2019s analysis was outdated and the fence was only one reason for the decline. Johnson was specifically talking about a fence along the Israeli-Egyptian border. Johnson\u2019s team referred us to a January 2013 article in the Jerusalem Post about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu touring a completed 143-mile fence along the Sinai border. The article noted that an additional 8 miles of fencing was still to be completed along mountainous terrain near Eilat. When fully completed, the fence would run from Kerem Shalom (where Sinai and Israel meet the Gaza Strip) to Taba on the Red Sea, according to the article. Fence construction started in November 2010 and came with a price tag of 1.6 billion Israeli shekels, the Jerusalem Post reported. The senator's office saidan Israeli official told Johnson that the fence cost $415 million during a tour while Johnson was in Israel. (The Wall Street Journal in January 2013 pegged the fence\u2019s cost at $416 million.) To determine a $2.9 million cost per mile, Johnson divided $415 million into the 143 completed miles cited in the 2013 article. (The cost per mile goes down to about $2.7 million when factoring in the total project of about 150 miles.) So Johnson appears largely correct about the cost of the wall. How about its success in keeping people trying to cross the border illegally out? That number checks out, too. This month, Johnson, who chairs the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, released a report titled \"Securing Israel: Lessons learned from a nation under constant threat of attack.\" The report came after a trip Johnson made to Israel where he met the Israeli prime minister and other security officials. The report notes that the number of people illegally crossing the Israel-Egypt border was more than 16,000 in 2011 and less than 20 in 2016, a 99 percent decrease. Netanyahu recently touted his country\u2019s southern barrier and gave a nod to Trump, tweeting on Jan. 28, \"President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.\" President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Experts we reached out to agree that illegal immigration along Egypt\u2019s southern border has indeed significantly dropped in the years after the fence was built and that Johnson's assessment of its costs and timeframe are sound. However, they warn against generalizing that the fence is the sole reason for the drop and raise objections in comparing Israel\u2019s border issues to those in the United States. The success of barriers such as a wall or fence depend on their scale and how heavily guarded they are, said Reece Jones, a political geography professor at the University of Hawai'i-Manoa and who has written about money spent on border security projects and their consequences. On a small scale and with many guards, walls can effectively stop movement, Jones said. But Israel and the United States\u2019 southern borders are significantly different. The Israel-Egypt border fence is about 150 miles. The U.S.-Mexico border is nearly 2,000 miles. Terrain conditions and number of agents needed to monitor the border are not comparable either, Jones said. \"Most of the Israeli fence goes through open, arid terrain. Easy to access, easy to build, easy to monitor with agents,\" Jones said. The U.S.-Mexico border, on the other hand, includes very remote, mountainous terrain and spans the length of four states with cities closely intertwined with Mexico. Trump has said that border has 1 million legal border crossings daily, which experts have told us include people traveling back and forth for school, work and shopping. Investment in high-tech features such as drones, robots and sensors is also crucial for border security, not just fences, added Elisabeth Vallet, who leads a research team on border walls and is Raoul-Dandurand Chair at the University of Quebec at Montreal. Without those features, people may still go undetected or go around through another border. If illegal entries surge at another border point, then the effectiveness of the fence at one border comes into question, Vallet said. \"While the numbers show a dramatic decrease in the number of entries, the amount of credit attributed to the fence is an issue of serious debate in Israel,\" said Yonatan Jakubowicz, director of research and public relations at the Israeli Immigration Policy Center, an NGO in Israel. Some were skeptical about the fence\u2019s effectiveness when the idea was introduced in 2009, but the barrier received wider support after a terrorist attack on the border road in August 2011, Jakubowicz said. He also said that aside from the fence, additional policies have reduced illegal immigration. The number of illegal border crossings decreased drastically \"in an extremely short time\" after the implementation of an \"Anti-Infiltration Law\" in mid 2012, Jakubowicz said. Under the law, individuals caught illegally entering Israel could be detained for up to three years, Jakubowicz said. The number of people illegally crossing Israel\u2019s southern border decreased after the law came into effect, even though the fence was not fully completed, he said. \"The fact that people continued to arrive even after the total completion of the fence, with fluctuations, proves that a barrier makes illegal migration more difficult, but not impossible,\" Jakubowicz said. \"Personal interviews and close inspection of migrant diaspora news outlets show that the combination of the fence and the immigration policies are to be attributed to these numbers, and not the fence alone.\""

However, this process is ongoing, and as of the time of the article (April 2018), nearly every neighborhood park still lacks recycling.\n\nBased on these facts, it can be concluded that the statement \"Nearly every neighborhood park in Austin lacks recycling\" is accurate based on the evidence provided.",
    "doc": "Despite\u2019s Austin\u2019s \"zero-waste\" commitment, an advocacy group says that nearly every city park lacks recycling. We wondered about that declaration by the Texas Campaign for the Environment, which describes itself as the state\u2019s largest environmental group organizing support through door-to-door canvassing. An April 2018 handout from the group notes that the city adopted a zero-waste commitment in 2011 requiring businesses and landlords to provide recycling. The city has a goal of reducing trash sent to landfills by 90 percent by 2040. \"Unfortunately,\" the TCE handout says, the \"zero-waste\" requirement \"does not apply to city government operations\" and parks rank among big missed opportunities. \"As many as 293 out of 300 parks have no recycling, including almost every neighborhood park,\" the handout says. There\u2019s also good news, the handout says, in that the city has launched recycling in every recreation and cultural center and in most of Austin\u2019s biggest parks. Still, 293 of 300 parks, including nearly every neighborhood park, have no recycling? By email, Andrew Dobbs, the group\u2019s Central Texas program director, said he based his statement on an April 2018 city staff presentation to Austin\u2019s Parks and Recreation Board. A slide in the presentation says the city has 300 parks. Two subsequent slides say a pilot program has introduced recycling to Zilker, Town Lake, Walnut Creek, Bull Creek and Ramsay parks plus Walsh Boat Landing. Other slides say recycling also has been added to more than five city swimming pools, five of six city golf courses and two softball complexes. Dobbs told us the campaign knows of one other park with recycling bins thanks to a neighborhood association. The group\u2019s handout, Dobbs said, says \"as many as 293 out of 300\" parks have no recycling \"because we aren\u2019t 100% certain if other parks might have recycling added on an ad hoc basis.\" Records show Austin\u2019s Parks and Recreation Department made the recycling presentation to two city boards. By phone, we separately confirmed TCE\u2019s count of parks without recycling from Charles Vaclavik, a parks department official, who told us that plans are in motion next to expand recycling mostly along the south side of Lady Bird Lake through Roy G. Guerrero Colorado River Park. Vaclavik said Austin\u2019s parks-with-recycling count would be higher if the department had started its pilot recycling program in 2017 by concentrating on small neighborhood parks rather than installing recycling bins in large \"metropolitan\" parks the city\u2019s jewel, 351-acre Zilker Park. \"We concentrated (instead) on the activity centers that have the most people,\" Vaclavik said, seeking a \"bigger bang for the buck.\" To date, he said, the recycling pilot has diverted about 35 percent of materials previously destined to move from trash cans to a landfill. Another factor: The city has yet to budget for recycling in its parks. Liana Kallivoka, the department\u2019s assistant director, told the city\u2019s Zero Waste Advisory Commission at its April 11, 2018, meeting that department officials were drafting a request for $250,000 in recycling-specific funding in the next city budget. If approved by the Austin City Council, Kallivoka said, the money would fund a program coordinator and hundreds of pairs of waste-recycling receptacles with tops, which run $1,100 each, to follow on 150 pairs already installed in park facilities and outdoors. Shelley Parks, a city spokeswoman, told us by phone that the cost of the installed bins was covered largely by donors including the Austin Parks Foundation, the Trail Foundation, neighborhood associations and the office of City Council Member Alison Alter, who represents District 10. Generally, Kallivoka told the commission, the department\u2019s goal is to extend recycling to all parks and facilities in three phases wrapping up with the addition of recycling to neighborhood parks. Commission members approved a resolution calling for the city to create a Parks & Recreation Recycling Task Force. The resolution says, in part, that \"approximately 4 of 300 City of Austin parks and 14 of 51 City of Austin aquatic facilities currently provide recycling opportunities.\" Austin\u2019s Parks and Recreation Board voted to urge creation of the same task force at its April 24, 2018, meeting. Dobbs also spoke to the commission, saying: \"The good news is that we\u2019re at a point where everybody wants to do this.\""

In addition, we discovered ample analysis of Obama\u2019s action that calls into question whether it protected some workers but harmed others.The backgroundThe United States and China became permanent, normal trading partners in 2001, after China joined the World Trade Organization. As a condition of joining, China agreed to a provision in law that lets the U.S. government determine whether a product from China is being imported in such increased quantities that it causes \"market disruption\" to domestic producers.In the years following that agreement, several petitions were filed under the provision, called Section 421. But President George W. Bush rejected the petitions on the reasoning that any limitations on Chinese products would be filled in by other foreign exporters and American companies would not ultimately benefit.A Section 421 petition is what brought the tire question to Obama\u2019s desk.In 2009, the United Steelworkers sought relief from a surge in Chinese tire imports that the union said had cost more than 5,000 U.S. jobs since 2004. A panel with the U.S. International Trade Commission heard the case and determined that \"certain passenger vehicle and light truck tires from the People\u2019s Republic of China are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers of like or directly competitive products.\"The panel recommended a three-year tariff, of 55 percent in the first year, 45 percent in the second year and 35 percent in the third year. Obama did impose a tax, albeit a lighter one of 35 percent, 30 percent and 25 percent over three years. It was the first time a president approved Section 421 relief on imports from China.

But if that\u2019s what their response is, my experience is over time, they will lose out slowly but surely. As they protect their lack of productivity with barriers, they will become less and less competitive, the foreign guys will get more and more volume, more and more successful, they\u2019ll become more and more productive. The domestic guys get less and less productive, less and less competitive, until finally even the tariff can\u2019t hold them out and the foreign products come flooding into the marketplace and the domestic guys are gone. So putting barriers up, trying to put walls up, in my opinion is a defeating strategy and will yield ultimate decline and collapse.\"In his 2010 book, No Apology, Romney wrote that action by the government to protect individual industries should be rare and temporary.\"President Obama\u2019s action to defend American tire companies from foreign competition may make good politics by repaying unions for his support of their campaign, but it is decidedly bad for the nation and our workers. Protectionism stifles productivity,\" he wrote.Finally, in a policy memo, Romney\u2019s policy director Lanhee Chen also characterized Obama\u2019s intervention as little more than a favor to unions that backed his campaign.\"What message does it send the Chinese when President Obama takes protectionist action against China on behalf of Big Labor, undermining free trade principles for political gain? The Obama campaign has repeatedly held out its Section 421 action against Chinese tires as an example of President Obama\u2019s supposedly tough China policy.\"Did the tariff protect jobs?It\u2019s clear to us that the claims in the ad are substantially accurate. Obama did push back against China to protect American tire manufacturing jobs, and Romney did criticize him.But Romney wasn\u2019t alone, and we think it\u2019s worth examining the real effect of the tariffs on American jobs. Some pro-trade groups tell a different side of the story than the ad.The U.S.-China Business Council, a private organization comprised of companies that do business with China, said the tariff did succeed in lowering Chinese imports, as expected, but the vacuum wasn\u2019t filled by American producers.\"We\u2019re still importing a lot of tires from Indonesia, Taiwan and Mexico,\" said communications director Marc Ross. \"It just shifted supply chains.\"What\u2019s more, the council said job gains for tire makers were more likely due to the burgeoning economic recovery and improved outlook for the auto industry, more so than the tariff.The Peterson Institute study, mentioned above, did attribute 1,200 tire jobs to the tariff, but found there were other employment casualties.\"The additional money that U.S. consumers spent on tires reduced their spending on other retail goods, indirectly lowering employment in the retail industry,\" the authors wrote.The fallout? \"On balance, it seems likely that tire protectionism cost the U.S. economy around 2,531 jobs, when losses in the retail sector are offset against gains in tire manufacturing.\"As for those higher prices, the Peterson study said consumers paid an extra $1.1 billion for tires in 2011 because of the tariffs, and \"adding further to the loss column, China retaliated by imposing antidumping duties on U.S. exports of chicken parts, costing that industry around $1 billion in sales.\"The Wall Street Journal noted that the steelworkers union \"believes the measure has been a success, adding jobs to the U.S. It cites anecdotal and other evidence of production expansion across the industry. Some companies have indeed added production and employees, but whether that is a result of the tariff or the recovery in the U.S. economy isn't entirely clear.\""

    "claim": "Says New Jersey has gained \"143,000 new private-sector jobs.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The claim that New Jersey has gained 143,000 new private-sector jobs is true based on the evidence provided. The article cites data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows that New Jersey had 3,192,000 private-sector jobs in February 2010 and by August 2013, that figure was 3,334,400, indicating a gain of 142,400 jobs. While the methodology used to measure job gains may not be ideal, the numbers provided are generally accurate. Additionally, an economics professor at Rutgers University analyzed the data and found that nearly half of New Jersey's private-sector job growth came during the year reviewed, and the state's job growth rate exceeded that of neighboring states. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, the label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim.",
    "doc": "The state and national economies might not exactly be robust since the recession ended four years ago, but Chris Christie claims New Jersey has been seeing steady and sustained job growth in that time. Christie touted that growth during his four appearances Nov. 10 on the major Sunday morning news programs including Face The Nation, ABC News This Week, Fox News Sunday and Meet The Press. In fact, The Colbert Report, a faux news program on Comedy Central, poked fun at the governor\u2019s appearances during a tightly edited clips sequence shown Nov. 11. The sequence starts by Christie downplaying on each show claims of a presidential run in 2016 and instead focusing on his being New Jersey\u2019s governor. To illustrate that point, the clips then lead into Christie saying the state has gained \"143,000 new private-sector jobs.\" Christie\u2019s number is generally accurate, but the methodology used to measure the jobs gains isn\u2019t exactly ideal, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. First, the numbers. Christie\u2019s timeframe for measuring jobs was February 2010 -- his first full month in office -- to August 2013, the most recent month for which preliminary employment data is available. New Jersey had 3,192,000 private-sector jobs in February 2010, BLS data shows. By August 2013 that figure was 3,334,400. The difference? 142,400 jobs. So Christie rounded up a bit when he cited a gain of 143,000 jobs, but his number is generally solid. Those numbers also match employment data on the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development website. Next, the methodology. The timeframe cited by Christie isn\u2019t even. Experts have told PolitiFact New Jersey on numerous occasions that the best way to evaluate employment trends is to measure seasonally adjusted, year-over-year data. Seasonally adjusted data is best for review because it takes into account jobs that result from seasonal hiring patterns. So when looking at annual data, we often review December over December to get the most accurate picture of employment for that 12-month period. But in Christie\u2019s case, we\u2019re evaluating February 2010 over preliminary data for August 2013. Joseph Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, agreed that it\u2019s best to review seasonally adjusted data within the context of a year. He reviewed the BLS numbers from August 2012 to August 2013 and then looked at how New Jersey\u2019s job growth compares with neighboring states. Seneca\u2019s analysis found that nearly half the state\u2019s private-sector job growth came during the year that he reviewed: 60,300 private-sector jobs. In addition, New Jersey\u2019s job growth rate of 1.8 percent exceeded that of New York and Connecticut, both with 1.3 percent growth, and Pennsylvania, which had a growth rate of 0.9 percent. \"The latest year-over-year data indicate that New Jersey is right in the middle of the pack in terms of the rate of private-sector job growth,\" Seneca said in an e-mail, adding that much of the growth has been in education, health services, leisure and hospitality, trade, transportation and utilities."

    "claim": "North Korea has a \"substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "comparison",
    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it can be concluded that North Korea has a substantial standing army, one of the largest per capita in the world. The article cites several sources, including the U.S. Department of Defense report to Congress, which estimates that North Korea's total military personnel ranks as the fourth largest in the world. Specifically, the report states that North Korea has approximately 950,000 ground forces, 60,000 naval personnel, and 92,000 air force personnel, for a total of about 1.1 million personnel. These numbers are significantly higher than those of other countries per capita, with China having the largest active military in number of personnel, followed by the United States and India.\n\nFurthermore, the article notes that while North Korea's military hardware is largely legacy equipment based on designs from the Soviet Union and China dating back to the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, there are a few systems based on modern technology. This suggests that while North Korea's military may not be as technologically advanced as some other countries, it still maintains a significant number of personnel.\n\nAdditionally, the article cites a statement by Gen. James D. Thurman, commander of the United States-South Korea combined forces, before the House Armed Services Committee, which supports the idea that North Korea has a large military force. The Economist article also ranks North Korea fourth in overall personnel, with 1.2 million active-duty personnel, behind China, the United States, and India.\n\nBased on these sources, it can be concluded that North Korea has a substantial standing army, one of the largest per capita in the world. While its military hardware may be outdated or obsolete, its sheer number of personnel is significant and should not be underestimated. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "In recent weeks, the North Korean government has made numerous increasingly provocative statements threatening South Korea and the United States, at one point warning South Korea that \"our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now.\" As the rhetoric was escalating, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke of North Korea\u2019s military capabilities during an appearance on WJAR Channel 10\u2019s \"10 News Conference.\" Reed was asked about North Korea\u2019s recent moves and generally about what threat it could pose to the United States. Reed said that there is concern that, in five or more years, North Korea could increase its capability to launch nuclear missiles that travel longer ranges. \"They have a substantial standing army, one of the largest, certainly the largest per capita, in the world,\" he said of their conventional, non-nuclear, military. We wanted to know whether North Korea -- officially the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea -- really has such a large force, based on the best-known information. The caveat of best-known is underscored by a recent New York Times news analysis, which reported on the difficulties the United States faces getting accurate intelligence about the country and raised questions about the accuracy of information about things such as nuclear weapons. We contacted Chip Unruh, Reed\u2019s spokesman, who e-mailed links to several documents. One is a U.S. Department of Defense report to Congress on North Korea that says that country\u2019s total military -- army, air and naval capabilities -- \"ranks in personnel numbers as the fourth largest military in the world.\" It fields \"primarily legacy equipment,\" the report states, meaning hardware \"based on designs of the Soviet Union and China, dating back to the 1950s, \u201860s and \u201870s, though a few systems are based on modern technology.\" According to the Department of Defense report, at about 950,000, \"the ground forces comprise the vast majority of North Korea\u2019s military.\" The report estimates that country has some 60,000 naval personnel and 92,000 air force personnel -- a total of about 1.1 million. Several other sources provided by Unruh, including a March 28, 2012, statement before the House Armed Services Committee by Gen. James D. Thurman, commander of the United States-South Korea combined forces, supported the statement that North Korea has the fourth largest military in terms of sheer manpower, behind China, the United States and India. The 2012 U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs fact sheet said the estimated active-duty military force in North Korea is as many as 1.2 million personnel. Unruh also supplied a link to a short 2011 article and graphic in The Economist magazine. Using data from 161 countries for which such information was available, according to the magazine, the graphic said China had the largest active military in number of personnel -- more than 2.25 million -- while the United States was second with upward of 1.5 million active-duty personnel. India was third in manpower. The Economist placed North Korea fourth in overall personnel at about 1.2 million, but the Economist also noted that, if looked at per population, North Korea was, by far, the \"most heavily militarized of all,\" saying there were 49 military personnel for every 1,000 North Koreans -- a ratio greater than that of any other nation. China has a population estimated at 1.3 billion people, with 1.7 military personnel for every 1,000 Chinese, and the United States has a population estimated at more than 316 million, with 5.5 military personnel per 1,000. We checked the CIA\u2019s latest estimate, for July 2013, which put North Korea\u2019s population at about 24.7 million people. Finally, we contacted the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which issues an annual report \"The Military Balance\" on nations\u2019 military capabilities. Mark Fitzpatrick, director of the institute\u2019s nonproliferation and disarmament program, e-mailed that Reed\u2019s statement \"sounds correct to me\" but suggested checking the militaries of some smaller nations such as Israel. The Economist reported that Israel had 23 military personnel per 1,000 population. Of course, sheer manpower numbers aren\u2019t necessarily a good measure of a nation\u2019s military capability. And analysts often assert that much of North Korea\u2019s technology and hardware is outdated or obsolete. But that\u2019s beyond the scope of our analysis."

    "claim": "\"794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since B.H. Obama took office, with no special recognition from the White House.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The label \"False\" is appropriate for the claim that \"794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since B.H. Obama took office, with no special recognition from the White House.\" The evidence provided by the article undermines this claim.\n\nFirstly, the Officer Down Memorial Page, which provides the number cited in the meme, counts deaths off-duty \"while acting in an official capacity to prevent loss of property, injury, or death, or is targeted because of his/her duties as a law enforcement officer.\" This includes deaths that occurred during training exercises, while on patrol, and during other official duties. The meme's number is likely higher than the actual number of officers killed in the line of duty since Obama took office, as it includes officers who died while acting in an official capacity but may not have been targeted because of their duties as law enforcement officers.\n\nSecondly, while the number of officers killed in the line of duty has increased in recent years, according to the FBI statistics, the number of deaths has declined noticeably in recent years. The meme's claim that there has been \"no special recognition from the White House\" for fallen officers is also incorrect. Obama has appeared at several events honoring fallen law enforcement officers, including a Presidential proclamation on Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service, and a White House Rose Garden ceremony honoring the National Association of Police Organizations \"Top Cops.\" These events demonstrate that the White House has acknowledged and honored the sacrifices of fallen law enforcement officers.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that 794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since Obama took office is false. The actual number of officers killed in the line of duty during this time period is likely lower than the meme's number, and the White House has indeed recognized and honored the sacrifices of these officers through various events and proclamations.",
    "doc": "Recent events in Ferguson, Mo., have inspired waves of anger on social media. Recently, a reader asked us to check one of the memes now circulating on the Internet. The meme pairs two images. One captures several flag-draped coffins, presumably of lawenforcement officers. The other is a still from surveillance footage showing Michael Brown allegedly assaulting an employee at a convenience store that he\u2019s suspected of robbing the day he was killed by police officer Darren Wilson. To these images, the meme adds the following text: \"Want to know where racial tension and cultural divide comes from? \"794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since B.H. Obama took office, with no special recognition from the White House. \"A man robs a convenience store and assaults a cop; the White House sends three representatives to his memorial service.\" The meme appears to stem from the \"Culture Crisis in America\" Facebook community, which describes itself as \"an e-magazine for Americans subscribing to the notion that the cultural deterioration of American values rests within the root of economic and social crises across our land, and indeed, the globe.\" We\u2019ll quickly note that, according to news reports, the White House did send three representatives to the service for Brown: Broderick Johnson, chairman of the My Brother's Keeper Task Force; Marlon Marshall, deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement; and Heather Foster, an adviser in the public engagement office. (Marshall had personal as well as professional reasons to attend; he\u2019s a St. Louis native and attended high school with Brown's mother.) Here, we'll focus on the meme's claim that Obama has been indifferent to lawenforcement officers killed in the line of duty, giving them \"no special recognition.\" Is that correct? Have 794 officers been killed in the line of duty since Obama was inaugurated? The meme footnotes its figure to the website Officer Down Memorial Page, a privately run page that memorializes and keeps count of the number of police killed in action every year. Between 2009 and Dec. 2, 2014, the site counted 834 deaths. The lower number on the meme probably because the number of deaths has increased since its creator first looked up the number. Due to differences in methodology, the Officer Down Memorial Page figure is somewhat higher than the official federal statistics, which are accessible in an FBI database known as \"Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted.\" The FBI figures show 521 deaths from 2009 to 2013, roughly half from felonious homicides and half from accidents in the line of duty. If you extrapolate the numbers to include 2014, that would work out to roughly 625 deaths. That\u2019s smaller than what was cited in the meme, but given the diversity of criteria that can be used to calculate this statistic, we\u2019re not overly concerned about the meme\u2019s number. (The Officer Down Memorial Page, for instance, counts deaths off-duty \"while acting in an official capacity to prevent loss of property, injury, or death, or is targeted because of his/her duties as a law enforcement officer.\") One footnote: The numbers of fallen officers have been declining rather noticeably in recent years. According to the FBI statistics, the number of officers killed initially rose from 96 in 2009 to 128 in 2010, but then began falling, to 125, then 96 and finally to 76 in 2013. That\u2019s a 41 percent decline in three years. Has there been \"no special recognition from the White House\" for fallen officers? This is where the meme is entirely off-base. We found many instances of White House \"special recognition\"for fallen officers. Here\u2019s a selection of events where Obama has appeared, all archived a few quick keystrokes away on the White House website: \u2022 May 7, 2010: Presidential proclamation for Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week. Excerpt from proclamation: \"As a nation, we rely on law enforcement officers to keep our neighborhoods safe, enforce our laws, and respond in times of crisis. These men and women sustain peace and order across America, and we look to them as models of courage and integrity. This week, we honor their extraordinary service and sacrifice, and we remember the fallen heroes whose selfless acts have left behind safer streets and stronger communities.\" \u2022 May 15, 2010: Presidential remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial. Excerpt from Obama\u2019s remarks: \"To the survivors of fallen law enforcement officers, our hearts go out to you for your loss. The husbands and wives, mothers and fathers you loved, they protected us all. And all Americans are grateful for the lives that they gave in the line of duty.\" \u2022 May 12, 2011: Presidential remarks at a White House Rose Garden ceremony honoring National Association of Police Organizations \"Top Cops\" Excerpt from Obama\u2019s remarks: \"Tomorrow we know that you and your fellow first responders will be back on your diligent duty -- looking out for us, looking out for one another, looking back at times with fallen partners, determined to make sure that their extraordinary sacrifices were not in vain. And we will be standing behind you, as one nation and one people, proud of your actions, awed by your courage, and grateful for your service on our behalf.\" \u2022 May 15, 2012: Presidential remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service at the U.S. Capitol. Excerpt from Obama\u2019s remarks: \"Today, with heavy hearts, we honor those who gave their lives. .... Their families are in our thoughts and prayers, as we remember the quiet courage of the men and women we have lost. \u2026 The rest of us can never fully understand what you go through. But please know that we hold you in our hearts -- not just today, but always. We are forever in your debt. And it is on behalf of all of us, the entire American people, that I offer my thoughts, my prayers, and my thanks.May God shine a light upon the fallen and comfort the mourning.May he protect the peacemakers who protect us every day.\" \u2022 May 15, 2013: Presidential remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service at the U.S. Capitol. Excerpt from Obama\u2019s remarks: \"Scripture tells us, \u2018None of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.\u2019 The brave officers we gather to remember today devoted themselves so fully to others -- to serve and to protect others -- that in the process they were willing to give their lives. And so, today, let us not remember them just for how they died, but also for how they lived. \u2026 We can never repay our debt to these officers and their families, but we must do what we can, with all that we have, to live our lives in a way that pays tribute to their memory.\" \u2022 May 9, 2014: Presidential proclamation for Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week. Excerpt from proclamation: \"During Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, we celebrate those who protect and serve us every minute of every day, and we honor the courageous officers who devoted themselves so fully to others that in the process they laid down their lives. As we mourn the fallen, let us also remember how they lived.\""

The evidence provided does not support this claim.\n\nIn the January 2012 debate, Romney referred to a plan advocated by Newt Gingrich, not Ryan's specific proposal. Romney's comment was in reference to a plan that called for a 0% tax rate on capital gains, which was not Ryan's plan.\n\nAdditionally, an August 2012 article in Roll Call found that if Ryan's plan had been law in 2010, Romney's effective tax rate would have been about 1%, not zero. The article also noted that Romney's income from capital gains, dividends, and interest would have been subject to the lower tax rates under Ryan's plan, resulting in a significantly lower tax bill compared to his actual tax payment.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it is not accurate to say that Mitt Romney said he would have paid no taxes under Paul Ryan's tax plan. The claim is Conflicting and should be treated with caution.",
    "doc": "The day after Mitt Romney introduced U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate, Democratic activist Paul Begala suggested the presumptive Republican presidential nominee took into account how he would personally fare under Ryan\u2019s wide-reaching proposal for overhauling federal taxes.Begala, a Texan advising a pro-Obama super-PAC, Priorities Action USA, said in a Twitter post on Aug. 12, 2012: \"So THAT'S why he picked him. In Jan. debate Romney said of Ryan tax plan: \u2018Under that plan, I\u2019d have paid no taxes in the last two years.\u2019\"Did Romney air the personal impact of Ryan\u2019s tax ideas so many months ago?After emailing Begala, we found Romney\u2019s remark in the Republican presidential candidate debate held Jan. 23, 2012, in Tampa, Fla.But according to the debate transcript, Begala\u2019s tweet struck a misleading note: Romney, who earlier noted that his proposed tax plan calls for eliminating the tax on interest, dividends and capital gains for anyone making less than $200,000 a year, was referring to a plan advocated by then-candidate Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker.After Gingrich confirmed that his plan called for a 0 percent tax rate on capital gains, Romney said: \"Under that plan, I`d have paid no taxes in the last two years.\"Gingrich: \"Well, if that -- and if you created enough jobs doing that -- it was Alan Greenspan (former head of the Federal Reserve) who first said the best rate, if you want to create jobs for capital gains, is zero. My No. 1 goal is to create a maximum number of jobs to put the American people back to work. It`s a straightforward argument.\"Moderator Brian Williams then changed the subject -- and Ryan\u2019s tax plan went unmentioned in the debate. Begala later emailed us to share that his tweet stemmed from an Aug. 12, 2012, news blog post by the New York Times. The post, focused on Romney\u2019s just-revealed choice of Ryan, includes this: \"In addition, the budget Ryan presented to the House in April last year called for the elimination of taxes on capital gains and dividend income. Romney pointed out in a January 2012 debate that \u2018Under that plan, I\u2019d have paid no taxes in the last two years.\u2019\"Begala emailed us that his reliance on the Times\u2019 account shows he \"was acting reasonably & in good faith.\" The Times\u2019 blog post \"may have been wrong, but I had a right to rely\" on it \"for a tweet.\" Wondering about the effect of Ryan\u2019s plan, we pulled up an Aug. 11, 2012, news article in Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, stating that by its analysis, if Ryan\u2019s plan had been law, Romney's effective tax rate in 2010 would have been about 1 percent.The story says Ryan\u2019s proposal would have shaved Romney\u2019s tax bill by about 90 percent by eliminating taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest -- an element identical to the Gingrich plank singled out by Romney in the debate.\"Since about 95 percent of Romney's $21.6 million income came from those sources in 2010,\" Roll Call said, \"he would pay no taxes on the vast majority of his earnings. It's not certain exactly how low Romney's tax bill would go, but his income from other sources amounts to about $1 million, and Ryan's plan would set a new top rate of 25 percent. Romney's total tax bill would have dropped from the $3 million that he paid to a few hundred thousand dollars if Ryan's plan had been in effect.\"The story says Ryan also proposes eliminating the estate tax, \"which would benefit Romney's heirs by tens of millions of dollars.\"The article\u2019s descriptions of Ryan\u2019s proposal align with information Ryan has on a website devoted to his proposal.Separately, Matthew O\u2019Brien of the Atlantic wrote in an Aug. 11, 2012, blog post that Romney\u2019s 2010 tax rate under the Ryan plan would have been .82 percent. While his capital gains would have gone untaxed, the post says, Romney\u2019s earnings of nearly $594,000 in author and speaking fees would be taxed at 25 percent. Romney would have saved another $292,389 under Ryan\u2019s proposed elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax, according to the post, while still owing $29,151 in self-employment taxes on his author and speaking fees. So he would have paid $177,650 out of a taxable income of $21,661,344, the blog post says.We asked Romney\u2019s campaign about this claim. Spokesman Christopher Walker said by email that Romney has a tax plan, making speculation about other plans irrelevant. On his campaign website, Romney says he wants to maintain existing tax rates on capital gains, interest and dividends for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 or more."

    "claim": "Says her congressional district has 10,000 medical-device industry jobs and 1,000 will be lost because of health-care law tax.",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim made by U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn that her congressional district has 10,000 medical-device industry jobs and 1,000 of them will be lost because of the health-care law tax is CONFLICTING. The evidence provided in the article challenges this claim in several ways:\n\n1. Job numbers: The article points out that Blackburn's estimate of 10,000 jobs in her congressional district is higher than the actual number of medical device manufacturing establishments with 8,871 employees in seven Tennessee counties, which is closer to 9,000.\n2. Shift in production: The study assumes that a 2.3 percent excise tax and a 10 percent shift in production offshore could lead to the loss of up to 146,218 jobs nationwide, including 1,023 jobs in Tennessee. However, the article questions whether this shift to overseas employment is a reasonable assumption, especially since there is no incentive to move production out of the country due to the tax exemption for devices made in the US for sale overseas.\n3. Price sensitivity: The article notes that health-related spending is relatively inelastic, meaning that when prices go up, demand falls by only a fraction as much. This suggests that the impact of the tax on demand for medical devices may not be as significant as Blackburn suggests.\n4. Underestimation: The industry trade group commissioned by AdvaMed may have underestimated the increased demand for medical devices under the Affordable Care Act, which could mitigate the impact of the tax on job losses.\n\nBased on these points, it is possible that Blackburn's claim of 10,000 medical-device industry jobs in her congressional district and the associated job loss due to the health-care law tax may be overstated or inconsistent with available data and evidence. Therefore, the label CONFLICTING is appropriate.",
    "doc": "We\u2019ll know later this month what the Supreme Court has done to the Affordable Care Act and which of its thousands of provisions will stand or be axed. Meanwhile, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives is trying to nibble away at individual provisions.Several members of Congress, including U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., recently gathered for a photo opportunity and to speak for repealing a health-care law provision that applies to a 2.3 percent excise tax on the sale of medical devices and for a bill that would repeal it.\"In my congressional district, we have about 10,000 individuals that are employed in the medical device industry,\" Blackburn said. \"We have estimates from the Manhattan Institute that 1,000 of those jobs will be lost if this tax stays on the books.\"That sounded pretty drastic to us. We decided to check out the accuracy of Blackburn\u2019s summary of the institute\u2019s findings, and what went into the institute\u2019s estimate.We first went to Blackburn\u2019s press person, Mike Reynard, who sent us a YouTube video of Blackburn\u2019s statement; LifeScience Tennessee\u2019s Workforce Development Survey which includes as its third federal and regulatory priority \"Medical Device Tax Repeal\"; and, the Manhattan Institute\u2019s 30-page analysis of \"The Employment Effects of the New Excise Tax on the Medical Device Industry\" by Diana and Harold Furchtgott-Roth.The Manhattan Institute is a conservative, market-oriented policy think tank based in New York City. It has received funding from the usually politically neutral Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Walton family foundation, but also from very conservative Koch and Scaife family foundations.LifeScience Tennessee is the non-profit advocacy group promoting the life science industry in the Volunteer State. Its survey uses slightly different numbers from Blackburn\u2019s in describing the Manhattan Institute\u2019s findings, saying it \"predicts a loss of 1,000 jobs in Tennessee, which currently employs more than 9,000 workers directly and many more indirectly.\"Since we know some of those 9,000 jobs are in Johnson City, Chattanooga and and Knoxville and other places outside Blackburn\u2019s 7th Congressional District, we can begin to quibble with Blackburn\u2019s suggestion that 10,000 are in her district, which stretches to connect suburban Nashville to suburban Memphis.Figures for 2011 from the Department of Labor and Workforce Development indicate there were 236 medical device manufacturing establishments with 8,871 employees in seven Tennessee counties -- or more than 10 percent fewer than Blackburn claimed were in her own congressional district.Blackburn represents people in parts of two of those counties -- Davidson and Shelby -- and those counties employ 6,044 people, a majority of the jobs in that category. We also know that in Shelby County, a large majority of those jobs have long been located in the mostly urban 9th Congressional District, not the suburban-rural 7th. Three Medtronic and three Smith & Nephew operations all have addresses within the 9th Congressional District.Also worth noting -- because of re-districting, Blackburn will represent neither Shelby nor Davidson next year if she\u2019s re-elected.Reynard, her spokesman, said Blackburn didn\u2019t mean to say \"in my congressional district,\" but rather that \"she meant \u2018state.\u2019 \" However, as of June 15, the video of the statement was still posted by the \"RepMarshaBlackburn\" channel on YouTube without any clarification, and other partisan websites were featuring it. PolitiFact policy is to rule on what is said, but to acknowledge when someone admits to a mistake and take that into account when making a ruling.Blackburn does make the point that anything affecting medical device manufacturing could have a significant effect on Tennessee employment -- many of her suburban residents do in fact work for firms like Smith & Nephew and Medtronic -- so let\u2019s look at exactly what the Manhattan folks said.The study says Tennessee had 9,179 medical device manufacturing jobs statewide in 2009, nearly 10 percent fewer than Blackburn claimed. It then goes into a discussion from Macroeconomics 101 on the excise tax\u2019s anticipated effect on the elasticity of demand for medical devices. It assumes that price-sensitive elasticity would send some manufacturing offshore. It breaks down the number of jobs lost by the effect of the tax on a shift in production offshore of 1 percent, 2 percent, 5 percent, all the way up to 30 percent, where it says as many as 146,218 of the estimated 409,000 jobs nationwide might be lost.Table 11 on page 21 of the report indicates that in Tennessee 1,023 of 9,179 jobs would be lost statewide assuming a 2.3 percent excise tax and a 10 percent shift in production offshore.But is that shift to overseas employment a reasonable assumption?We hear a lot of talk these days about penalizing, not rewarding, companies that use the overseas labor of low-wage countries. To the extent it\u2019s not just talk, some politicians are seeing that some constituents thought they favored \"free trade\" until they saw that free-trade agreements may lower standards of living and manufacturing employment numbers of higher-wage countries.It\u2019s safe to say this debate will rage on, but what\u2019s less clear is the extent to which health-care spending is sensitive to fluctuations in price. How will those who need a catheter or a stent, or those who manufacture them, respond to the imposition of a 2.3 percent excise tax? If someone needs crutches, is a 2.3 percent rise in price a major consideration? A 2006 study cited by Businessweek in March indicates health-related spending is \"relatively inelastic: When prices go up, demand falls by only a fraction as much.\"The same Businessweek article notes that another study, commissioned by the medical device industry trade association AdvaMed, also assumed that American manufacturers would ship 10 percent of jobs overseas in response to the tax. But since the tax applies to all devices -- those made overseas as well as domestic production -- there would be no incentive to move production out of the country, it says, describing a Bloomberg Government analysis. Devices manufactured in the U.S. for sale overseas are exempt from the tax.It also makes the case that the industry trade group underestimated the increased demand for medical devices from the 32 million more people who will be insured under the Affordable Care Act."

    "doc": "One of the issues that sparked outrage around the State House in June was the last-minute lawmaking on behalf of the auto body shop industry. Around3 a.m.onJune 13, lawmakers approved a bill giving auto body shops the right to sue insurance companies if they couldn't agree on the cost of car repairs. The legislation was pushed by John Petrarca, president of Providence Auto Body, and his daughter, Jina Petrarca-Karampetsos, spokeswoman for the Auto Body Association of Rhode Island. They are the father and sister, respectively, of Rep. Peter J. Petrarca, D-Lincoln, who did not vote on the bill. But insurance company representatives said Representative Petrarca, the House senior deputy majority leader, had lobbied hard for the legislation. Governor Chafee vetoed the bill days later, saying it would hurt consumers by generating lawsuits that ultimately would increase insurance premiums and interfere with customers' contracts with their insurance companies. But Petrarca's challenger in the House District 44 Democratic primary, Gregory J. Costantino, sought to keep Petrarca in the cross hairs of criticism when the two men appeared on \"Newsmakers\" on Channel 12 (WPRI) onAug. 12. Costantino said that while Petrarca might not have voted on this most recent legislation, he had voted on auto shop bills in the past, which Costantino described as a clear conflict of interest. As an example, Costantino referred vaguely to a bill in 2003 and another one in 2010. He gave no specifics about either piece of legislation. In response, Petrarca said: \"I don't know what they do. I don't know what they are.\" And then he launched into an unrelated line of incriminations against Costantino. We were curious what legislation Costantino was referring to and whether he was correct in saying that Petrarca - whose law firm represents Providence Auto Body and the Auto Body Association of Rhode Island- had indeed voted for them. In a telephone interview, Costantino identified the two bills in question, amended pieces of legislation that had passed between the House and Senate: 2003 Senate bill 0022 and 2010 Senate bill 2508. The 2003 bill specifies standards for when \"aftermarket\" parts - those that come from a company other than the car manufacturer - can be used in repairs. For instance, it states that if an insurance company orders an auto body shop to use an aftermarket part, the insurance company is responsible for any cost a shop incurs trying to fit that part into place. It also requires the shop to notify the appraiser if the aftermarket part does not restore the car to its original condition. The 2010 bill would make it an unfair claims practice if an insurance company failed to use an independent appraiser -unaffiliated with the repair shop - when vehicle damage exceeded $2,500. We called the State House Library to check the House Journal for the votes of those two bills. The records do indeed show Petrarca voting on both occasions - each time in favor of the bills, which passed. When we called Petrarca, he said he still didn't know what bills his opponent had been talking about, and so we brought him up to speed with what we learned. He was unapologetic. \"Those two bills, those pieces of legislation, do not benefit body shops,\" he said. \"They benefit the consumer.\" With the 2003 bill, he said, \"If the shop can prove that the aftermarket part doesn't fit, they [insurance company] have to pay for a new part. \"There is no conflict [of interest] because it doesn't affect body shops. He [Costantino] should get his facts right.\""

    "doc": "Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke doubled down on his pitch to institute a mandatory gun buyback program for assault-style weapons during the third debate of the presidential primary in Houston. \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\" O\u2019Rourke saidat the debate.\" We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\" His comments were met with boisterous applause from the audience at Texas Southern University and he was on the receiving end ofa threatening remarkfrom a state lawmaker in Texas. They also sparkeda questionable Facebook post, shared the day after the debate. This postwas flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more aboutour partnership with Facebook.) The post includeda popular memethat is derived from stills of Drake\u2019s 2015 music video for \"Hotline Bling.\" The meme traditionally features two images of the singer and corresponding text generated by the poster. The idea is to make it appear as though Drake is shunning the first phrase, but welcoming the second. In the post in question, the first phrase is: \"Beto O\u2019Rourke wants to confiscate the guns because he\u2019s a liberal.\" The second, which Drake seems to signal his approval of, reads: \"Beto O\u2019Rourke wants to confiscate guns because he can\u2019t buy one himself due to his criminal record.\" The text of the post says: \"That burglary and DWI will get you every time.\" We\u2019ve looked at O\u2019Rourke\u2019s arrest record in the past, but is he ineligible to purchase a gun, as the post suggests? Both DWI, burglary arrests were dismissed O\u2019Rourke was arrested twice in the 1990s \u2014 for, what he describes as, jumping a fence on the campus at the University of Texas at El Paso and for driving while intoxicated. He was first arrested in May 1995 on the UTEP campus for attempted forcible entry, according toa copy of the police reportprovided by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign in 2018. The charge fell under the burglary portion of the state penal code,section 30.02. O\u2019Rourke told the El Paso Times in 2005 that UTEP \"decided not to press charges\" and a LexisNexis background check of O\u2019Rourke shows that the Class B misdemeanor was dismissed. In September 1998, O\u2019Rourke wasarrested and charged with driving while intoxicatedin Anthony, a small town outside El Paso. A witness told police officers that they observed O\u2019Rourke driving at a high speed before losing control of his car and striking a truck, according toa police report of the incident. O\u2019Rourke then attempted to drive away, but the witness stopped him, according to the report. Law enforcement arrived and arrested O\u2019Rourke, recording that he scored a 0.136 and 0.134 on a breathalyzer test, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time. O\u2019Rourke was charged with a misdemeanor DWI, but the charge was dismissed after he completeda misdemeanor diversion programin 1999. In summary: O\u2019Rourke was arrested for two separate misdemeanors in the 1990s, including one for a DWI. Both cases were dismissed. O\u2019Rourke could purchase a gun There is no requirement for a person to have a permit or license to purchase rifles and shotguns or handguns in Texas, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s home state. As long as a purchaser is older than 18 and, in certain cases, passes a background check, the person can legally purchase a firearm without a permit. (A permit is required to carry a handgun in public.) Licensed-gun dealers are required by federal law to conduct a background check for an individual seeking to purchase a gun if that person does not have a license to carry. But private sellers do not have the same requirement. Federal and state lawsin Texas prevent a person from purchasing and possessing a gun if they have previously been convicted of a felony or convicted of certain misdemeanors related to domestic assault. Certain people with a history of mental illness are also barred from purchasing a gun. O\u2019Rourke would be able to purchase a gun, since he was not convicted of burglary or of driving while intoxicated \u2014 both charges were dismissed. Even if he had been convicted, neither charge would prevent him from legally purchasing and possessing a firearm today, since they were both misdemeanor offenses unrelated to domestic violence and were resolved more than five years ago. O\u2019Rourke could also obtain a gun license Misdemeanor DWI offenses play a more significant role when it comes to obtaining a license to carry in Texas. State law allows for people, not including those in the prohibited categories outlined above, to possess a handgun in their home or in their car without a license to carry. People can also carry rifles and shotguns in public without a permit. In order to purchase a gun without a background check and to carry a handgun in public, a person must obtain a license to carry from the state. Requirements for obtaining such a licenseare more stringent than those for simply purchasing a gun. Most important in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s case is a requirement that a person is not currently facing charges for \"a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense\" and a requirement that an individual \"has not, in the five years preceding the date of application, been convicted of a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense.\" The law also states that a person is not eligible to receive a license to carry if the person has been \"convicted two times within the 10-year period preceding the date on which the person applies for a license of an offense of the grade of Class B misdemeanor or greater that involves the use of alcohol or a controlled substance as a statutory element of the offense.\" O\u2019Rourke was arrested on a burglary charge in 1995, a misdemeanor offense that was dismissed. He was arrested for DWI in 1998, a misdemeanor offense that also was dismissed after he completed a diversionprogram. Neither arrest, taken separately or together, would prevent him from obtaining a license to carry a gun under Texas law. \"He has no convictions on his record, so there is zero collateral consequence, vis-\u00e0-vis his ability to get a gun license,\" said Steve Toland, an Austin-based defense attorney who handles DWI cases. The Texas Department of Public Safety, which administers the licensing program, lists answers to frequently asked questions on its website, including one about how dismissed charges affect eligibility. \"If charges were dismissed without prosecution, then they are not disqualifying,\" the post reads. If O\u2019Rourke\u2019s misdemeanor DWI had not been dismissed and he had been convicted, he would still be eligible to apply for a gun license today, since more than five years have passed. Had O\u2019Rourke applied for a license after his arrests, when the charges were still pending, he would not have been eligible for a gun license. But since he was not convicted of either charge, he would have been eligible for a license once his cases had been dismissed."

    "justification": "The claim that \"We moved 100 times as many people out of poverty as moved out when President (Ronald) Reagan was in office, with 40 percent more jobs\" is appropriately labeled as \"Conflicting.\" While the evidence does show a decrease in the number of people living in poverty during Bill Clinton's presidency compared to Ronald Reagan's, the ratio of people moved out of poverty and jobs created is not accurately represented by the statement.\n\nThe article provides data on the number of people living in poverty and jobs created during both presidents' terms in office. When comparing the numbers from Clinton's first year to his last full year in office, and Reagan's first year to his last full year in office, the evidence does show a larger decrease in poverty during Clinton's administration. However, when looking at the number of people moved out of poverty and jobs created from the year each president took office to the year they left office, the difference is not as substantial.\n\nWhile Bill Clinton's presidency did create more jobs than Reagan's, the ratio of people moved out of poverty to jobs created is not 100 times higher. The evidence shows that approximately 6.3 million people moved out of poverty during Clinton's administration, while 294,000 people moved out of poverty during Reagan's. This means that the ratio of people moved out of poverty to jobs created is approximately 21 times higher during Clinton's presidency, not 100 times higher as claimed in the statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label the claim as \"Conflicting.\" The statement exaggerates the difference in poverty reduction and job creation between the two presidents, and does not accurately represent the data provided.",
    "doc": "A video introducing Bill Clinton before the Democratic National Convention showcased the former president\u2019s accomplishments during his terms in office, from 23 million jobs created to a budget surplus to the signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act. \"His actions have changed millions of lives for the better,\" a narrator says. Clinton appears in the video saying, \"We moved 100 times as many people out of poverty as moved out when President (Ronald) Reagan was in office, with 40 percent more jobs.\" That \"100 times\" feat sounded familiar. Clinton himself said it before in an October 2014 campaign stop in Milwaukee for Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also said it in July 2014 in an interview on PBS\u2019 The Charlie Rose Show. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign guided us to reports that used Census poverty data to analyze the statement. If you crunch the numbers from the presidents\u2019 first years to their last full year in office, they support Bill Clinton\u2019s statement. But if you look at the numbers from the year they took office (1993 for Clinton and 1981 for Reagan) to the year they left office, the ratio is a lot smaller. For context: Clinton was elected in 1992 and served from January 1993 to January 2001. Reagan, a Republican elected in 1980, served from January 1981 to January 1989. Poverty changes from first year to last full year in office When Clinton took office in 1993, there were about 39.3 million people in poverty. By his last full year (2000), there were about 31.6 million -- a difference of 7.7 million people. When Reagan stepped into office in 1981, there were about 31.82 million people in poverty, by his last full year (1988), there were about 31.74 million -- a change of 77,000 people. So, using these sets of years, it does show that 100 times as many people moved out of poverty during Clinton\u2019s administration compared to Reagan\u2019s. However, when we calculate for years they took office to the years they left office, the numbers don\u2019t show a \"100 times\" change. For Clinton, about 6.3 million moved out of poverty, for Reagan, 294,000. That\u2019s a difference of about 21 times. While these numbers give us an insight into how many people are living in poverty, economists have told us it\u2019s hard to say how many people actually move out of poverty. Someone who is making just $1 above the poverty threshold may still be struggling and not feel out of poverty. Jobs created The second part of Clinton\u2019s statement says his presidency created 40 percent more jobs than Reagan\u2019s. During Clinton\u2019s tenure, 22.9 million jobs were created, an increase of 21 percent over the eight-year period. When Reagan was president, 16.1 million jobs were created, or an increase of 18 percent over the eight-year period. Overall, then, Clinton\u2019s job-creation total was 42 percent higher than Reagan\u2019s was -- 16.1 million for Reagan vs. 22.9 million for Clinton. It\u2019s important to note that Reagan became president as the country was in a recession, and Clinton took office as the economy was bouncing back."

    "justification": "The claim that President Barack Obama said he did not have the authority to implement this type of anti-deportation measure 22 times before signing it into law is true. The evidence provided in the article supports this claim.\n\nFirstly, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas, who led the legal challenge against Obama's actions, stated that Obama was their star witness and mentioned 22 instances where Obama said he did not have the authority to implement such measures. This quote from Abbot is supported by the article which mentions Obama's exact wording, \"I just took an action to change the law,\" which he made five days after the administration's action was announced, not the next day.\n\nSecondly, the article provides a detailed analysis of recent history, including Obama's 2014 moves to forswear the deportation of unauthorized residents meeting certain conditions and his willingness to apply discretionary powers by issuing a \"deferred action\" directive that immigration officials not deport young immigrants who had not otherwise run afoul of the law. This demonstrates Obama's willingness to use executive authority to address immigration issues, which contradicts his claim that he did not have the authority to implement this type of measure.\n\nThirdly, the article cites a list of 15 instances from 2010 into 2014 where Obama said he couldn't do more to spare immigrants from deportation absent congressional action, which supports the claim that Obama did not have the authority to implement this type of measure.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that President Barack Obama stated multiple times that he did not have the authority to implement this type of anti-deportation measure before signing it into law. Therefore, the label \"True\" is justified.",
    "doc": "After a federal judge in Texas ruled against President Barack Obama\u2019s actions potentially shielding thousands of unauthorized residents from deportation, the Texan who led the court challenge described Obama as a key helper for the states challenging the Democratic president\u2019s authority. Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican who in 2014 launched the legal challenge joined by more than 20 other states when he was still the attorney general of Texas, told Sean Hannity of Fox News: \"I think we will win all the way for one simple reason, and that is: The man you just had on the screen, Barack Obama, is our star witness.\" Abbott added in the Feb. 17, 2015, interview: \"22 times Barack Obama said he did not have the authority to implement this type of measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, \u2018I just changed the law.\u2019 Those words alone show that he violated the Constitution and violated federal law.\" We learned of Abbott\u2019s quotation of Obama and his \"22 times\" count from a Breitbart.com news story, which also noted the president\u2019s exact wording had previously been, \"I just took an action to change the law,\" and that Obama made that comment five days after the adminstration\u2019s action was announced, not the next day. We looked into Abbott\u2019s count of 22 and his quotation, ultimately finding his statement close to completely so. But we started by revisiting recent history. Obama and Abbott announcements In November 2014, Obama declared the administration\u2019s plans to forswear the deportation of unauthorized residents meeting certain conditions, telling the American people: \"If you\u2019ve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you\u2019re willing to pay your fair share of taxes \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law.\" Shortly before Obama detailed his 2014 moves, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., found False the Democratic president\u2019s statement that his position hadn\u2019t changed on using executive authority to address immigration. Notably, the administration in June 2012 demonstrated a willingness to apply its discretionary powers by issuing a \"deferred action\" directive that immigration officials not deport young immigrants who had not otherwise run afoul of the law. The move potentially shielded hundreds of thousands of residents under age 30. Critics called the move an abuse of authority. Proponents said it was in keeping with the yet-to-pass DREAM Act providing a path to citizenship for children brought to the U.S. by immigrants not legally permitted to live here. Fast-forward to Dec. 3, 2014; that\u2019s when Abbott announced Texas and other states were challenging the latest Obama move in federal court. And what the state filed that day included a version of the Obama quotation we\u2019re looking into: \"What you\u2019re not paying attention to is, I just took an action to change the law.\" Speaking to reporters, Abbott commented: \"The president\u2019s job is to execute the laws, not de facto make law by suspending parts of laws that are passed by Congress.\" We asked Abbott to elaborate on his claim to Fox News and didn\u2019t hear back. But we recognized he\u2019d echoed another Texan\u2019s criticism. In December 2014, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, drew a Mostly True from us after saying Obama had previously \"said over 20 times he did not have the legal authority\" to act as he did on immigration. McCaul had relied on a list of Obama quotations posted online by House Speaker John Boehner, which we found partly flawed, making McCaul\u2019s count too high. In the end, still, we confirmed nearly 15 instances from 2010 into 2014 of Obama saying he couldn\u2019t do more to spare immigrants from deportation absent congressional action. White House response Asked about McCaul's claim at the time, White House spokesman Eric Schultz responded by email, pointing out a Nov. 19, 2014, memo from the federal Office of Legal Counsel stating the president\u2019s actions fit within the government\u2019s discretionary powers. The office, in the Justice Department, is responsible for providing authoritative legal advice to the president and executive-branch agencies. It\u2019s a challenge to characterize the president\u2019s remarks. For instance, Abbott\u2019s legal filing included Obama\u2019s Sept. 28, 2011, response to a law student\u2019s request that he do his part to enable students who immigrated to the U.S. with their parents to become legal residents. As noted in the legal filing, Obama replied: \"I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true. We are doing everything we can administratively. But the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that I have to enforce.\" The legal filing ends the quotation there, yet Obama continued talking and said he retained enforcement discretion. \"Now, what we can do is to prioritize enforcement,\" the president said, \"since there are limited enforcement resources, and say we\u2019re not going to go chasing after this young man or anybody else who\u2019s been acting responsibly and would otherwise qualify for legal status,\" if laws were changed. We counted 15 Obama quotations--not 22--in the Texas-led legal filing supportive of Abbott\u2019s point, with nearly all of them previously tick-tocked in our check of McCaul.

Did Obama say he personally \u2018changed the law?\u2019 Next, we searched the White House website and isolated what Obama said in a Chicago speech Nov. 25, 2014 after at least one audience member interrupted his remarks to urge a complete end to deportations. Here\u2019s what Obama replied, according to the government transcript: \"I've heard you. But you\u2019ve got to listen to me, too. All right? (Applause.) And I understand you may disagree. I understand you may disagree. But we've got to be able to talk honestly about these issues. All right? Now, you're absolutely right that there have been significant numbers of deportations. That's true. But what you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took action to change the law. (Applause.) So that's point, number one.\" Obama went on: \"Point number two, the way the change in the law works is that we're reprioritizing how we enforce our immigration laws generally. So not everybody qualifies for being able to sign up and register, but the change in priorities applies to everybody.\""

    "claim": "Says that 9 million to 50 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States.",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim because the evidence provides conflicting estimates of the number of undocumented immigrants living in the United States. While some sources suggest that there are around 11 million to 13 million undocumented immigrants in the country, others estimate the number to be significantly higher or lower. For example, the Texas Federation of Republican Women suggests a range of 9-50 million undocumented immigrants, while the Pew Hispanic Center estimates that there are 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants in the country as of March 2011. The report from the Center for Immigration Studies also concludes that there are around 10.5 million illegal immigrants in the country in 2010. However, other sources suggest that the number could be significantly higher or lower than these estimates. For instance, the Department of Homeland Security report suggests that there were 11.5 million illegal immigrants living in the country in January 2011, while the Pew Hispanic Center estimates that the number has decreased to around 11.1 million since then. Therefore, based on the conflicting evidence provided, it is appropriate to label this claim as \"Conflicting.\"",
    "doc": "A Texas group urging congressional action on immigration also says the number of illegal U.S. residents might vary more than five-fold.The Texas Federation of Republican Women, which describes itself as the state\u2019s most powerful women\u2019s political group, said in its Jan. 17, 2013, resolution: \"Within the United States, there currently reside between nine (9) and fifty (50) million undocumented residents from all cultural and socio-economic backgrounds and nationalities.\"That\u2019s some range. The 9 million figure undershoots a widely bandied estimate of 11 million, most recently included in December 2012 news accounts from USA Today and the Associated Press. The 50 million figure seems off the charts.And the full statement indicates that 3 percent to 16 percent of more than 315 million U.S. residents are here illegally.To our inquiries, a federation spokeswoman, Laura Sorrell of Austin, said the group drew its figures from different sources. She said by email that the group had no source to provide for the 9 million figure, while the 50 million figure was provided by a former fellow with Rice University\u2019s James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy, Joan Neuhaus Schaan. The 50 million methodologyBy phone, Schaan told us she reached her estimate, which she said she has not laid out in a research presentation, by assuming that annual apprehensions of border crossers represent about 10 percent of actual crossers, an assumption she said she based on years of speaking engagements, including many in the Texas-Mexico border region.Border region \"landowners, local law enforcement, those living the reality of human migration, would say that maybe 3 percent of those people that crossed were being apprehended,\" Schaan said. \"In some cases, thousands of people a week are crossing properties with virtually no apprehensions.\"Schaan was referring to apprehensions by the Border Patrol, part of the Department of Homeland Security, which reported in July 2011 that the number of apprehensions declined 61 percent from nearly 1.2 million in 2005 to 463,000 in 2010, with the vast majority of them occurring along the southwest border near Mexico. The 2010 total was the lowest level since 1972; peaks in apprehensions, of early 1.7 million, were reached in 1986 and 2000, it says.Yet the report cautions against presuming that apprehensions relate to a particular number of individuals. \"Apprehension data... represent events, not individuals,\" it says. \"The total number of apprehensions during a specific period will be greater than the total number of unique individuals apprehended because some individuals will have been apprehended more than once. The relationship between the number of border apprehensions to either the number of attempted illegal entries or the number of successful illegal entries is unknown.\"Other estimatesTo take our own look, we turned to several oft-quoted sources, each one lately suggesting there are 11 million to 13 million illegal U.S. residents.According to a March 2012 Department of Homeland Security report, there were 11.5 million illegal immigrants living in the country in January 2011, about the same number as in 2010, and a little more than half of the 22 million legal foreign-born residents in the country.Some history: The United States was home to up to 4 million illegal residents in 1980, the report says, with the number peaking at 11.8 million in 2007.The report, drawing from U.S. Census Bureau household surveys and Homeland Security figures, says some 55 percent of the unauthorized residents entered the country between 1995 and 2004, with entrants since 2005 accounting for 14 percent of the illegal 2011 residents.\"It is unlikely that the unauthorized immigrant population increased after 2007,\" the report says, \"given relatively high U.S. unemployment, improved economic conditions in Mexico, record low numbers of apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants at U.S. borders, and greater levels of border enforcement.\"The report says 59 percent of the country\u2019s unauthorized immigrants in 2011, some 6.8 million, were from Mexico, with 2.8 million living in California, 1.8 million in Texas.More recently, the Pew Hispanic Center said in December 2012 that 11.1 million unauthorized residents lived in the country as of March 2011, \"unchanged from the previous two years and a continuation of the sharp decline in this population since its peak in 2007,\" the center said, when the number of illegal immigrants in the United States peaked at 12 million.Both Homeland Security and the Pew center devised their estimates by drawing on the census surveys and applying a \"residual\" method of calculation. \"Under this methodology,\" Pew wrote, \"a demographic estimate of the legal foreign-born population \u2014 naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents, temporary legal residents and refugees \u2014 is subtracted from the total foreign-born population. The remainder, or residual, is the source of population estimates and characteristics of unauthorized immigrants.\"The Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, said it took a similar approach to conclude in an August 2012 report that there were 10.5 million illegal immigrants in the country in 2010, though it said that after adjustments of undercounting of the population by the U.S, Census Bureau the total could have been 11.5 million or more.Most \"research indicates that roughly 10 percent of illegals are not counted in Census Bureau surveys,\" the report says, meaning the \"true size of the illegal population could be 11.5 million. If the undercount is larger, then the total illegal alien population is larger.\"By email, the center\u2019s research director, Steve Camarota, said there could be 13 million illegal residents in the country. He said, though, that he doesn\u2019t see how administrative records such as births or school enrollments would justify any conclusion that such estimates are off by huge margins.\"There is uncertainty in the numbers,\" Camarota said. \"But not that big.\"We also touched base with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which says its mission is to educate Americans about the costs of immigration, particularly illegal immigration. A spokesman, Jack Martin, said by phone that the group has taken up the estimates by Homeland Security, the Pew Hispanic Center and the Center for Immigration Studies and made adjustments for what it believes to be some untallied residents. He said FAIR believes there are 11.9 million illegal residents.Weaknesses in 50 million figureWe asked Martin for his thoughts on the topmost figure in the Texas group\u2019s resolution, 50 million.He said there is no logical basis for such an elevated estimate, though similar errors were made in the past when observers incorrectly counted each government apprehension of an illegal immigrant as an immigrant \u2014 even if the same person was apprehended by authorities a dozen times in a matter of weeks or over a year. Worse, he said, some observers erred by adding each year\u2019s apprehensions to the tally for each subsequent year, inaccurately describing the ballooning total as a count of illegal immigrants in the country at that time.Similarly, Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, said it\u2019s a mistake to convert the number of Border Patrol apprehensions into a count of individuals living in the country.Aside from noting the same weakness identified by Martin, Passel said by phone that given that most apprehensions involve men, relating total apprehensions to the number of illegal residents in the country would erroneously signal that Mexico is overrun with women alone. Also not factored in, Passel said, is the fact that many illegal residents travel, staying in the U.S. for a few months at a time or less.Schaan\u2019s methodology \"has no validity,\" Passel said.Finally, Martin also sounded a general cautionary note about pinning down the number of illegal residents. \"Any estimate is simply an estimate,\" he said.Schaan stuck by her figure, emailing: \"Clearly we have a difference of opinion on the approximate number, and any research group will be compelled to support their own positions and downplay anything different. There is no question in my mind the 11 million to 13 million figure is low, but there is no way to prove it one way or the other.\"Sorrell, of the federation, told us by email that the point of its resolution was to not get bogged down with the numbers, but to prove a point that no one knows what the actual numbers are."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" accurately reflects the discrepancy between Speaker Weatherford's claim and the evidence provided in the article. While Weatherford claims that half of the people who would qualify for Medicaid expansion can buy a healthcare plan for $30 a month on the federal healthcare exchange, the article provides estimates that indicate this is not the case.\n\nAccording to the article, only about 23% of the 1.3 million uninsured Floridians who would be eligible for Medicaid expansion can buy insurance on the federal marketplace with tax credits. This means that Weatherford's claim is significantly exaggerated, and the actual number of people who can afford coverage on the exchange is much lower than he suggested.\n\nTherefore, the label \"Conflicting\" accurately reflects the discrepancy between Weatherford's claim and the evidence provided in the article.",
    "doc": "Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford has been a vocal opponent of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. He\u2019s no fan of the law\u2019s proposed Medicaid expansion, especially. During an interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board on Feb. 27, Weatherford played down the need for Medicaid expansion, which the Legislature rejected last year. He said many Floridians who might have enrolled under an expanded Medicaid system can now buy affordable private insurance from the federal website HealthCare.gov. \"If you live above the 100 percent of the poverty rate today, which is about 400,000 of the 800,000 who would qualify for Medicaid expansion, half of the people who qualify for Medicaid expansion today can buy a health care plan for $30 a month on the exchange,\" he said. Weatherford added that he thought people in that income range \"should be able to afford $30 a month and have some skin in the game.\" We wondered if half of the people who would have been eligible under a potential Medicaid expansion could get a private insurance plan for $30 a month. We ran the numbers and found that Weatherford had a point that many people who would have been eligible for Medicaid can buy plans from healthcare.gov for $30 a month. But it\u2019s not half of them, it\u2019s a good bit less. Showing you why is going to involve a deep dive into how the health care law works. Medicaid math The federal government offered to pay all the costs initially for states to expand Medicaid, a health insurance program for the poor, and 90 percent in later years. But Florida opted not to expand coverage. Just how many people would have been covered under the potential Florida expansion is hard to gauge. Estimates put it at about 1.3 million. The government uses the federal poverty level as the measure to determine a person\u2019s eligibility to receive assistance for government programs such as Medicaid and, in the case of the Affordable Care Act, eligibility for insurance subsidies. For 2014, the poverty level is set at $11,670 for a single person and $23,850 for a family of four. Florida\u2019s Medicaid program has more than 3 million enrollees, but many residents don\u2019t qualify under the program\u2019s guidelines. Some people, like young adults and parents, have to be at 22 percent of the Federal Poverty Level or below to qualify, but most single adults without children don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid at all. The federal law intended to allow all poor adults into the program, but Florida opted not to expand the program. Who gets tax credits? The federal health care law intended for the very poor to get Medicaid and for low-wage workers to get tax credits to buy private insurance. The law splits those groups up by income, using definitions based on the federal poverty level. People who make 138 percent of the poverty level or lower would be eligible for Medicaid. People who make between 138 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level would get subsidies to buy private insurance on sites like HealthCare.gov. It doesn\u2019t work like that in Florida, though, because the state chose not to expand Medicaid. In states that don\u2019t expand Medicaid, the law also allows people making between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level to shop for private insurance with subsidies. (Why that\u2019s the case is another complicated story, which we will address in a separate report.) Weatherford is right that those people can buy insurance on the exchange. So how much will it cost them? The president\u2019s health care law keeps premium costs low for households making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level by providing tax credits to purchase insurance. The size of the tax credit is adjusted based on the cost of the second-least expensive silver option available in the marketplace. (Plans can be bronze, silver, gold or platinum, with the most generous -- and expensive -- plans being platinum.) Break out your calculators: The second-cheapest silver plan can only cost 2 percent of an individual\u2019s annual income for households making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. For a person making $16,104, that\u2019s an annual premium of $322, or $26 a month. By plugging demographic and salary information into HealthCare.gov, we can see how this rule bears out. For example, a 35-year-old single man living in Pinellas County and making $16,104 a year (138 percent of the federal poverty level) is \"eligible for a premium tax credit\" of up to $198 a month, according to HealthCare.gov. That individual could find a Bronze level plan from Humana for $0 a month (yes, zero dollars), albeit with a $6,300 deductible. He could also buy six other plans from various providers for $30 a month or less. What about a family of four (two adults and two children under 18) living in Miami-Dade County making exactly 100 percent the federal poverty level, or $23,850 a year? The children may be eligible for Medicaid through the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, HealthCare.gov says. The parents would have to buy insurance on the federal marketplace, but they would be eligible for a tax credit of up to $712 a month. With the tax credit, there are several Bronze options that would cost nothing, but the deductible would be capped at $12,600 a year. There are eight other options for less than $30 a month. Those individuals would also be eligible for co-payment assistance, which is available to individuals and families making up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level. It\u2019s not as good of a deal for those individuals as Medicaid would have been, which basically costs nothing for recipients, but Weatherford is right they could find coverage for pretty cheap. But what if you\u2019re a family of four making $12,599 a year, just one dollar less than the federal poverty level? The parents would no longer be eligible for any financial assistance toward their premiums. The same plans that would cost nothing to the family making $12,600, now cost $555 a month or more. Rachel Garfield, a senior researcher for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care research group, said those individuals making less than 100 percent the federal poverty level would likely be stuck in a situation where they couldn\u2019t afford coverage and would remain uninsured. The law says they cannot be penalized for not having insurance, because affordable coverage is not available to them. Other estimates So Weatherford is correct that some people can buy insurance for cheap on the federal marketplace. But is it half of the people who would have been covered by a Medicaid expansion? Greg Mellowe, director of health research and analysis at the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, said it appeared the speaker had gotten confused about his numbers. Mellowe cited a Kaiser Family Foundation study that said there are about 1.3 million uninsured Floridians making 138 percent of the federal poverty level or less. Of those people, about one-third earn enough to buy cheap coverage on the marketplace. In another study released in August 2012, the Urban Institute also found almost 1.3 million people would be eligible in an expansion. Of those, 300,000 had income between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about 23 percent, and would be eligible to buy in the marketplace. Weatherford\u2019s office told us his numbers were based on an estimate from staff analysts projecting that about 937,000 Floridians would be eligible under an expansion. Of those, about 314,000 were between 100 and 138 percent, meaning they now can buy insurance on the federal exchange. That\u2019s about 30 percent, though, not half. Spokesman Ryan Duffy said projections showed 402,000 Floridians between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level were expected to enroll over 10 years based on population and economic trends, and that\u2019s the figure to which Weatherford was referring. The speaker said \"today,\" though, not 10 years from now."

The loan guarantees given to Fisker Automotive were not part of the stimulus, and the majority of the components used in wind turbines were not made in China. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "In the vice presidential debate, Paul Ryan and Joe Biden argued whether the stimulus was worth the hundreds of billions of dollars that it cost the government.Ryan said, \"Look at just the $90 billion in stimulus. The vice president was in charge of overseeing this. Ninety billion in green pork to campaign contributors and special interest groups.\"Biden responded with, \"It was a good idea, Moody's and others said that this was exactly what we needed to stop this from going off the cliff. It set the conditions to be able to grow again.\"They argued about whether the stimulus money was wasted, and Ryan said \"Was it a good idea to spend taxpayer dollars on electric cars in Finland, or on windmills in China?\"Republicans have made these charges before. In this fact-check, we look at whether the stimulus money went where Ryan said it did.The Fisker electric carIn 2009, an American car company, Fisker Automotive, won a total of $528 million in loan guarantees to build two high-end electric hybrids, the Karma and the Atlantic. The ultimate goal was to build the Atlantic at a defunct auto plant in Delaware. Work on it is currently on hold, and the Delaware plant has yet to open.The engineering and design for the Karma was done in the United States, but according to the U.S. Energy Department, the plan from the beginning was to build the cars in Finland. Fisker Automotive told ABC News this work employed about 500 Finnish workers. Company spokesman Roger Ornisher told PolitiFact that the plant has produced over 1,500 Karmas so far.Not stimulus dollarsThe claim about American stimulus dollars paying for jobs in Finland is flawed in several important respects.First, the money did not come from the stimulus. This nuance seems to slip through the cracks again and again, so the correct information bears repeating.That money came as a loan -- not a grant or a tax credit -- through the Energy Department\u2019s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program. That program predates the Obama administration. It was not part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, also known as the stimulus. In fact, it\u2019s a program signed into existence by President George W. Bush in 2007 and first funded by legislation Bush signed in 2008.The only reference to this loan program in the stimulus is that it received $10 million for administrative expenses.The Bush administration was in charge when Fisker Automotive filed its application. The Obama administration was in charge when the company\u2019s loan was approved. The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it.Fisker Automotive says that the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers audits its accounts to insure that all federal dollars are spent in the United States.Windmills in ChinaWindmills from China have something of a history when it comes to political messaging. The Romney campaign sent us supporting documents for this claim. Among the reports and articles the campaign cites, one refers to a massive project in Texas that was never built and will never receive stimulus money. Others stem from the Investigative Reporting Workshop, a nonprofit journalism project at American University.The Investigative Reporting Workshop\u2019s report backs the claim but paints a murkier picture than the Romney campaign would have you think. The author tallied $2.6 million in stimulus money going to Chinese makers of wind turbines. However, the reporter, Russ Choma, also says that none of the farms used turbines entirely built in China. Additionally, he couldn\u2019t say for sure how much stimulus money made its way to China. \"Some money definitely did, but it is safe to say more money went to creating jobs in the U.S. and Europe,\" he wrote.A challenging money trailFederal support for renewable energy projects came through the 1603 tax credit program. So far, this program has paid out about $7.6 billion to wind farms nationwide. Once a project is on line and delivering power, that program pays money to the project developer -- as much as 30 percent of the project cost. Along the way, the developer pays the companies that provided the materials. Following the money becomes complicated because wind turbines are about as intricate as airplanes.To choose an example, let\u2019s look at a wind farm going up in Alaska. The lead contractor is General Electric, the world\u2019s third largest supplier of wind turbines and an American firm. But according to the Anchorage Daily News, \"The blades are made in Brazil, the units that contain the generator come from Southern California, the connecting hubs from the Florida Panhandle and the towers are made in China.\"We called the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group, to see if they knew of any Chinese turbines paid for with American stimulus dollars. They said they did. Their best guess is the number is six -- five in Texas and one in Iowa. But \"that might not be exactly right,\" said Liz Salerno, director of industry data and analysis . \"Because some of the blades and towers in Texas might have come from American firms.\"If it is six, that represents a tiny fraction of all the turbines installed with stimulus dollars. Salerno says the program funded more than 12,000 turbine installations over three years. Chinese components might have shown up in various places, but if one is counting complete Chinese \"windmills,\" then they account for less than 1 percent of the total."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that Mark Zaccaria's claim that public employees receive \"something like 25 percent of the paychecks that are issued in Rhode Island\" is false. The article provides data from the Department of Labor and Training, which shows that as of October 2012, there were approximately 50,000 local and state government jobs in Rhode Island, which represents about 11 percent of the state's total non-farm jobs. Even if you include federal government employees in the state, the number would still be less than half of Zaccaria's estimate.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label Mark Zaccaria's claim as false. His calculation is not supported by the data and is likely an exaggeration or a mistake. It is important to rely on accurate and reliable sources of information when making claims or drawing conclusions, rather than relying on unsubstantiated estimates or assumptions.",
    "doc": "Mark Zaccaria, the outgoing chairman of Rhode Island\u2019s Republican Party, was on WJAR-Channel 10\u2019s \"News Conference\" program recently, commenting on the hard time the state party had in legislative races this year.Though Republicans recently have had a strong record of success in winning the governor\u2019s office -- the Democrats have held it for just 4 of the last 28 years -- the Grand Old Party took a beating in state House and Senate races in November, dropping from 18 Republicans out of a 113-member General Assembly in 2010 to 11 in the session that will begin in January.Zaccaria said the party\u2019s poor showing was due in part to structural advantages he said the Rhode Island Democratic Party has developed over the years, particularly support from state and local government employees and their unions.\"If you add the members of the teachers unions, if you add the other public service employees all around the state that are municipally based,\" he said, \"it comes to something like 25 percent of the paychecks that are issued in Rhode Island.\"Now, we can\u2019t determine whether drawing a state or local government paycheck guarantees how someone might vote. But we did wonder whether Zaccaria\u2019s calculation was correct.When we asked him for his source, Zaccaria said he\u2019d been using the 25-percent estimate since he ran for Congress in 2010. He said he\u2019d done research to justify the figure, but after two years couldn\u2019t recall the specific source of the statistic.So we went to the website of the Department of Labor and Training, which tracks the number of jobs in the state month by month and year by year. According to its October 2012 report, the most recent, Rhode Island had 463,300 non-farm jobs.The department breaks down those jobs into more than two dozen categories, including federal, state and local government workers. The local government category includes public school teachers.If you combine the local and state government numbers for October 2012, you get about 50,000 jobs, or about 11 percent of that 463,300 statewide job total -- less than half of Zaccaria\u2019s estimate.Even if you add in the 10,000 federal government employees in the state, that would bring the number up to about 60,000, or about 13 percent of the state\u2019s work force.Because Zaccaria said he\u2019s been using his 25-percent figure since 2010, we went back to the 2010 numbers to see whether things were different then. They weren\u2019t.The closest he would have come was January 2010, the month when the number of total jobs was lowest.Combined state and local government employees were counted at about 52,000 that month, 11.7 percent of that month\u2019s 444,500 statewide jobs. Including 10,200 federal jobs that month would have bumped the public employee sector share to 14 percent, still short of 25 percent."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim that the federal government has $3 trillion in cash flow and will not default on its obligations because we have $3 trillion in cash flow so we can pay our bills. This is because while the evidence provided suggests that the government has a significant amount of cash flow, it also indicates that there are potential risks and uncertainties associated with paying all bills on time.\n\nFirstly, the evidence highlights that the government's cash flow may not be enough to cover all its obligations, particularly if incoming revenue falls behind spending demands. According to the Congressional Budget Office-projected $3 trillion in revenue stands to be outpaced by predicted expenditures of $3.6 trillion in the fiscal year, which raises questions about whether there will be days when cash flow undershoots what must be paid.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that there is uncertainty at the Treasury regarding how it would prioritize its payments in the event of cash-flow slowing. The Congressional Research Service floated opposite speculations, and the Government Accountability Office said in a 1985 letter to the then-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that the Treasury is \"free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the United States.\" This raises concerns about whether the government has a clear strategy to prioritize its payments in the event of cash flow shortages.\n\nThirdly, the evidence notes that if the ceiling is not raised, the government isn't expected to have sufficient cash to meet all obligations in a timely manner past the beginning of November 2013, at latest. This raises questions about what would happen if the government were to default on its obligations, and whether the label \"default\" is appropriate in this context.\n\nBased on these factors, it can be argued that while the claim that the federal government has $3 trillion in cash flow and will not default on its obligations may be technically correct, there are potential risks and uncertainties associated with paying all bills on time.

We have $3 trillion in cash flow, so we can pay our bills.\" We wondered about that, mindful that the U.S. Treasury secretary has speculated about the risks of the government not having enough cash on hand. Treasury secretary's warning The debt ceiling, now nearly $16.7 trillion, constrains how much the government can borrow to meet obligations. And in October 2013, the Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, told a Senate panel that unless Congress raised the ceiling, \"extraordinary measures\" taken since the spring would be exhausted no later than Oct. 17 \"at which point the federal government will have run out of borrowing authority. At that point, we will be left to meet our country\u2019s commitments with only the cash on hand and any incoming revenues, placing our economy in a dangerous position. \"If we have insufficient cash on hand,\" Lew said, \"it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, payments to our military and veterans and contracts with private suppliers for the first time in our history. At the same time,\" he said, \"we\u2019re relying on investors from all over the world to continue to hold U.S. bonds. Every week we roll over approximately $100 billion in U.S. (Treasury) bills. If U.S. bond-holders decided that they wanted to be repaid rather than continuing to roll over their investments, we could unexpectedly dissipate our entire cash balance.\" Williams' backup cites projected interest costs We asked Williams how he reached his conclusion. By email, Williams\u2019 spokeswoman Haley Graves provided a transcript of the Statesman\u2019s question to Williams, who has long owned automobile dealerships, and his response. Statesman: \"Do you think the warnings about what a failure to enact a debt ceiling increase, the effect on the economy, is overblown or is that real?\" Williams: \"We\u2019re not going to default because we do have $3 trillion of cash flow coming in to America. Alright? Now the cash flow doesn\u2019t flow evenly \u2013 it\u2019s like your business. You have receivable, this and that, but you do have $3 trillion in cash. That\u2019s more cash flow than we\u2019ve ever had coming in to the government than ever. And so we can pay our bills. We can pay our debt service. We can pay our military. We\u2019re not going to default.\" Graves said Williams based his $3 trillion reference on a May 2013 projection by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that the government would collect $3.042 trillion in revenues through the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 2013. Asked if Williams was referring to the government paying all its bills, Graves said Williams has said \"all along\" that the government will not default because its cash flow would be enough to pay bond holders and to fulfill interest payments. What's default? Observers of the debt-ceiling debate diverge on how to define a government default, though they agree it\u2019s not happened before. By telephone, economist Chris Edwards of the Cato Institute, a limited-government think tank, said Williams\u2019 main point is supported by the CBO\u2019s projection of $237 billion in net interest costs through the same fiscal year. Everyone agrees not paying such interest would hurt financial markets, Edwards said, but his sense is that if interest costs are paid on time, the government can avoid default, though that course could prove \"ugly,\" he said, because the Treasury would need to pick and choose which other obligations--ranging from Social Security checks to Pentagon contracts--to pay in full and on time. \"It would make people very mad,\" Edwards said, \"but it wouldn\u2019t be a default.\" Edwards also noted an Oct. 2, 2013, Yahoo Finance interview with David Stockman. Stockman, who headed the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, said that if the debt ceiling isn\u2019t raised, the government could easily tap incoming revenue to make its interest payments while also covering regular payments to Social Security retirees, the armed services and Medicare reimbursements. \"It is a complete red herring to say there will be a default,\" Stockman said. \"There will never be a time in which there is not enough cash to pay the interest.\" Then again, Edwards told us, a counter-argument he attributed to liberals and Democrats is that it would be very hard for the Treasury to make the described alternative spending choices. A Brookings Institution economist, Gary Burtless, said by email that it\u2019s conceivable the Treasury could prevent default on government-backed securities by keeping up with interest payments, though he said he lacked the expertise to judge whether the Treasury could legally implement a choose-the-bill-to-pay strategy. Realistically, Burtless said, if the government runs short of the revenue required to pay non-interest costs, that would seem like a default to any affected creditors. \"If a business makes timely payments on its secured and unsecured bank debt but does not make promised payment to its suppliers (for supplies already delivered), workers (for hours of work already supplied), and pensioners (for pensions promised under the company pension plan),\" he said, \"most observers would say the company has defaulted on its obligations to some of its creditors. Suppliers, workers, and pensioners are creditors of the company just as certainly as banks that have extended the company a loan.\" Also responding to our inquiry, economist Jared Bernstein of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget Policy Priorities pointed out by email that the CBO-projected $3 trillion in revenue stands to be outpaced by predicted expenditures of $3.6 trillion in the fiscal year. This leads to a key question, Bernstein said, as to whether there will be days when cash flow undershoots what must be paid. Bernstein noted that a September 2013 report by the Bipartisan Policy Center said this will occur with, for instance, revenue a few weeks after mid-October 2013 running behind spending demands by more than $100 billion. The report also said that if the government exhausted its ability to pay all its bills by Oct. 18, 2013, the Treasury would run about $106 billion short of meeting obligations over the next 20 business days. \"Approximately 32% of the funds owed for the period would go unpaid,\" the report said, with the reality proving \"chaotic.\" Uncertainty at Treasury We did not find any indication that the Treasury has aired a strategy to pick and choose which bills it pays in the event of cash-flow slowing. A Sept. 19, 2013, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service floated opposite speculations. In 2012, the report said, a Treasury official said the agency lacked congressional guidance on prioritization and hence only had a system to pay bills as they came in, one after the other. In contrast, according to the report, the Government Accountability Office said in a 1985 letter to the then-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Bob Packwood, that the Treasury was \"free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the United States.\" Burtless said that his understanding is the Treasury cannot prioritize its payments to contractors, Social Security pensioners, Medicare payees (doctors and hospitals that have provided services to the Medicare-insured population), non-furloughed civilian workers, members of the uniformed military, etc. If a supplier, a pensioner, a non-furloughed worker, military serviceperson, doctor or hospital does not receive timely payment, does that constitute a \u2018default\u2019?\" An Oct. 13, 2013, PolitiFact story listing questions and answers about the debt ceiling said that if the ceiling is not raised, the government isn\u2019t expected to have sufficient cash to meet all obligations in a timely manner past the beginning of November 2013, at latest. \"So what happens then?\" PolitiFact wrote. \"The most obvious solution (beyond simply doing nothing) is to prioritize payments. Bondholders would likely be paid off first, since a missed or delayed payment on a financial instrument would entail the most severe peril for the government. Outraging senior citizens by delaying or missing a Social Security check is bad enough, the thinking goes, but if investors decide en masse to abandon U.S. bonds in the future, it would put the entire stability of the federal government\u2019s finances (and ultimately, the U.S. economy) at risk. And according to experts, prioritization has problems. \"For one thing, the federal government\u2019s computer systems are not set up to do this, meaning it might not be a practical option (and could result in costly errors),\" PolitiFact said. \"In addition, the Treasury says it\u2019s not clear it would have the legal authority to make those sorts of decisions. And it could cost more, since the law requires the government to pay interest on top of any payments that are delayed. It\u2019s also not clear whether prioritizing bondholder payments would keep the United States from a \u2018default.\u2019 \"It all depends on how you define the word \u2018default.\u2019 Some lawmakers who downplay the consequences of hitting the debt ceiling argue that a default only happens if interest on securities isn\u2019t paid. A missed payment to a federal contractor or a Social Security recipient, according to this argument, doesn\u2019t trigger a default.\" The story noted that the CRS has \"acknowledged that there\u2019s no clear answer to this question, but it does note that Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines the term \u2018default\u2019 as \u2018the failure to make a payment when due\u2019 \u2014 a definition that does not restrict a default to a missed interest payment. Ultimately, CRS notes, \u2018financial markets\u2019 perceptions of what constitutes a default, or a real threat of default, may be more relevant when assessing the potential impacts of not raising the debt limit.\u2019\""

Christie solely for the increase in tuition at Rutgers.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that tuition at Rutgers has increased by 10% since Gov. Chris Christie took office is conflicting and should be labeled as such.",
    "doc": "Death and taxes aren\u2019t the only sure things in New Jersey. Increasing college tuition costs are pretty much a given, too \u2013 especially on Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s watch, according to state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who is challenging Christie, a Republican, in the Nov. 5 gubernatorial contest. Rutgers tuition has increased 10 percent since Christie took office because he \"cut funding for higher education,\" Buono told students during a recent stop at the university's New Brunswick campus. While the cost of an education at Rutgers and other schools in New Jersey has certainly risen in recent years, we were a bit stunned by this Rutgers Law School alumna\u2019s claim: not only has tuition at the state university climbed by less than 10 percent from the time Christie became governor in January 2010 to present, Buono\u2019s putting blame where it doesn\u2019t belong. Let\u2019s start by reviewing tuition costs for Rutgers since Christie\u2019s been in office. Tuition for in-state residents at Rutgers was $9,926 for the 2010-2011 academic year -- the first year that a Rutgers budget was crafted during Christie\u2019s tenure as governor. Tuition is $10,718 for the current 2013-2014 academic calendar. That\u2019s an increase of 7.97 percent, not 10 percent. David Turner, a Buono for Governor spokesman, told us it would be more appropriate to compare tuition and fees from 2009-2010 \u2013 before Christie took office \u2013 to 2013-2014. So we looked at those numbers, too. Tuition and fees for 2009-2010 was $11,886, compared with $13,499 for the current academic year. That\u2019s an increase of 13.57 percent, which is in line with Buono\u2019s claim. But there\u2019s a key difference: Buono specifically referenced a tuition increase so we removed fees from the equation and compared tuition from 2009-2010 ($9,546) with 2013-2014 ($10,718). The difference is an increase of 12.27 percent. That brings us to another critical point: Buono claims the increase has occurred \"since Christie took office.\" Turner said Christie's cuts to education had long-reaching effects on students. \"One of the Governor's first major acts was to slash New Jersey's higher education budget by more than $170 million,\" he said in an e-mail. \"By cutting the budget, the costs fell on to students who are now shouldering a 13% increase in tuition at our flagship university. These cuts unfairly place the burden on students and make it harder for them to get the skills they need to compete in the workforce of tomorrow.\" Christie in 2010 proposed cutting $173 million from higher education funding as the state faced a variety of deficits at the height of the recession. But is he solely to blame for tuition hikes at Rutgers? No. In fact, the governor of New Jersey has nothing to do with setting tuition costs at colleges and universities. Under state law, the Rutgers Board of Governors sets tuition and determines the rates of tuition for the institution as part of the university\u2019s annual budget, a spokesman told us. Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak agreed. \"Governors have no role in setting tuition, room/board and various fees at Rutgers,\" Drewniak explained in an e-mail. \"The Board of Governors votes annually to set those rates based on recommendations from the school\u2019s administrators. Surely, the Senator knows this given her vast experience in the legislature.\" It\u2019s worth noting that impacts from the recession also were being felt statewide at that time, even in education. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines the recession as lasting from December 2007 to June 2009."

    "doc": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton recently announced a $10 billion proposal for treating drug and alcohol addiction. While addiction and treatment has not traditionally been a top-tier issue in presidential races, it has attracted concern in key caucus and primary states this year, including New Hampshire, where Clinton announced her proposal in an op-ed in the New Hampshire Union-Leader. In explaining why an assertive policy response was necessary, Clinton wrote in the op-ed, among other claims, that \"23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get treatment.\" We wondered if her figures are accurate. On the ratio, Clinton is close. The most recent data from the federally sponsored National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated that 22.7 million Americans needed treatment for a drug alcohol problem but only about 2.5 million received treatment \"at a specialty facility.\" That means 11 percent of people who conceivably could have needed treatment at a specialty facility received it, or one out of every nine. This ratio has held steady over the years, said Arthur Robinson Williams, a fellow in the division on substance abuse in Columbia University\u2019s Department of Psychiatry. \"The 2013 survey was consistent with prior findings and estimates,\" Williams said. Still, we wondered about the survey\u2019s use of the term \"specialty facility.\" What does that mean? We found the definition: It refers to \"treatment received at drug or alcohol rehabilitation facilities (inpatient or outpatient), hospitals (inpatient services only), and mental health centers; it excludes treatment received in an emergency room, private doctor's office, self-help group, prison or jail, or hospital as an outpatient.\" Among the forms of treatment not counted are groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Not everyone agrees that AA is effective (or effective for everyone), and it is perhaps most helpful as reinforcement to other types of treatment led by clinicians. Still, the number of participants is hardly trivial: AA counted 1,283,704 members in the United States as of Jan. 1, 2015, plus an additional 35,349 in correctional facilities. Thousands more attended Narcotics Anonymous and other 12-step groups. As for excluding private doctor visits, the distinctions \"are likely true, but largely irrelevant,\" said David Rosenbloom, a professor of health policy and management at the Boston University School of Public Health. \"Treatment in doctor\u2019s offices is a relatively recent development, as medication-assisted addiction treatment through the medical care system has achieved regulatory approval.\" While \"many people with addiction could be treated in the regular medical care system,\" Rosenbloom said, \"the delivery mechanism to get from here to there isn\u2019t in place yet.\" Allowing for some definitional concerns about the numbers, Clinton \"is mainly right,\" said Arthur L. Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at the New York University Langone Medical Center."

Therefore, the label Conflicting is appropriate.",
    "doc": "On the first day of Florida\u2019s new texting-while-driving ban, state Sen. Maria Sachs, the Senate Democratic leader pro-tem, was already announcing a proposal to make the law tougher. The new law makes texting while driving a secondary offense, which means an officer can\u2019t ticket a motorist only for typing or reading messages while behind the wheel. Rather, the driver has to first commit another violation, like swerving or running a red light. Sachs, of Delray Beach, has filed a bill to make texting while driving a primary offense, which she argues will make it easier to enforce. The penalties -- $30 for a first violation -- will remain. At a press conference with AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson to announce her proposed changes, Sachs recited several somber statistics. We decided to fact-check this claim: \"In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths.\" There\u2019s little doubt that texting is a danger in automobile safety. A 2006 study by David Strayer and Frank Drews at the University of Utah found that people are just as impaired when they drive and talk on a cell phone as they are when they drive intoxicated at the legal blood-alcohol limit of 0.08 percent. The report, which looked at talking on handheld or hands-free cell phones and not texting, concluded that using a cell phone while driving \"can be as profound as those associated with driving while drunk.\" But is it true that in 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths? When we contacted Sachs\u2019 office, her legislative chief of staff said the information came from an op-ed piece AutoNation\u2019s Mike Jackson wrote for the Tampa Bay Times and from news articles about a study done by the Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center in Long Island, N.Y. The statistic quoted by Sachs has appeared in various media outlets, including CBS and Newsday, but the study\u2019s chief researcher, Dr. Andrew Adesman, said the media \"wrongly attributed\" the drinking-texting conclusions to his team\u2019s studies, a bit of misinformation that has continued to spread. Adesman said his research team analyzed CDC data -- the 2011 \"Youth Risk Behavior Survey\" The study found that 45 percent of U.S. high school students 16 and up (46 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls) reported texting while driving during the previous 30 days. The study suggested that the number could actually be a lot higher, given that 75 percent of teens now have cell phones. The study, however, didn\u2019t directly compare texting and drinking while driving, which makes Sachs\u2019 conclusion questionable. The study found a \"subgroup\" of the students who admit to texting while driving also tended to be involved in other risky behaviors on the road, including not wearing a seatbelt, riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol and drinking and driving. These risk takers were also more likely to smoke marijuana, have unsafe sex and \"use indoor tanning devices.\" The correlation of all these factors makes it difficult to determine what is the \"leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths.\" Indeed, certain aspects of the study didn\u2019t provide much support for proponents of texting laws. Researchers found that while texting while driving was slightly less common in states that prohibit it, \"the reality is that millions of teens text while driving,\" Adesman said. The study didn\u2019t consider the strength of the laws or penalties. Adesman did say there\u2019s reason to be alarmed about the number of teens texting. \"Kids aren\u2019t drinking on a regular basis on school days, but they are texting daily.\" (The CDC reports that high school teens drive after drinking 2.4 times a month.) Sachs said she wants to \"change the culture\" of texting while driving. \"I think our culture has turned against alcohol and driving, so we want to say to kids, \u2018you know it\u2019s wrong to drink and drive\u2019 and the same thing has to be said about texting.\" Another problem for Sachs\u2019 claim: The data isn\u2019t perfect. The involvement of cell phones is still underreported in accidents, said Deb Trombley, senior program manager for transportation initiatives for the National Safety Council. \"One challenge is that there isn\u2019t good data. Cell phone use isn\u2019t being recorded on crash reports\u2026 It goes down as distracted driving.\" Jackson\u2019s office said that he discovered the information about texting surpassing drunk driving as a cause of teen driving deaths from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website, but staff didn\u2019t have any further details. NHTSA officials said the data they collect suggested the opposite of what Jackson and Sachs claimed. According to the agency, 12 percent of 2,105 teen-aged drivers ages 14 to 18 involved in fatal crashes in 2011 were distracted in some way; 24 percent of those distracted drivers were using a cell phone. By comparison, 20 percent (428) of 14 to 18-year-old drivers involved in a fatal crash in 2011 had some level of alcohol in their system, according to NHTSA. A driving distraction can be anything from adjusting the radio or putting on makeup to eating a burger behind the wheel. With teens, there are often a bunch of noisy friends in the car."

The evidence provided in the article shows that McConnell's net worth increased significantly after he married Chao in 1993, but it does not suggest that he made millions as a senator. In fact, the article states that McConnell's salary as a senator has not changed since 1985 and that his wealth comes primarily from Chao's inheritance and her father's business success. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the claim being made does not align with the evidence provided.",
    "doc": "Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic challenger to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, thinks her opponent has been in office way too long. Grimes released a new ad last week that blasted McConnell for his 30-year tenure in Washington. McConnell -- the expected Senate majority leader if he defeats Grimes and the GOP wins enough seats in November -- is running for his sixth term. The ad says that one of the side effects of staying in office too long is that a senator can become a multi-millionaire and lose sight of the needs of average constituents. \"What can happen in 30 years?\" the ad\u2019s narration says. \"A senator can become a multi-millionaire in public office, while voting 17 times against the minimum wage, three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas, and 12 times against extending unemployment benefits for laid off workers.\" That\u2019s a lot to chew on, but we\u2019ll limit our assessment here to the question of whether senators can really make millions in office. Our friends over at theWashington Post Fact Checker looked into a similar claim by Grimes in May and found that it fell flat. Because the charge is being aired anew, we decided to take a look. Senate salaries It\u2019s true that McConnell was not a millionaire when he became a senator in 1985 but has become a multimillionaire since then. As of 2012, his estimated worth was $22.8 million, making him the 10th-richest senator, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which collects data on money in politics. That\u2019s almost twice as much net worth than the typical senator in 2012; the average was $12.1 million. The problem with the ad is its strong suggestion that McConnell made his millions from being a senator. That\u2019s not the case. When we asked the Grimes campaign for evidence, they pointed to Senate salaries going back to 1985. Senators\u2019 salaries have grown from $75,100 in 1985 to $174,000 in 2009, and they haven\u2019t changed since. McConnell has been the Senate minority leader since 2007, meaning his salary is higher -- about $193,400, according to the Congressional Research Service. (For comparison, Grimes\u2019 current annual salary as Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state is $117,329, according to the Kentucky state government\u2019s salary database.) So adding up annual salaries between 1985 and 2014 and adjusting for McConnell\u2019s leadership positions, McConnell would have earned more than $4 million before taxes and deductions. But as of 2012, McConnell is worth nearly $23 million. If his wealth didn\u2019t come from his office, how did McConnell get so rich? McConnell\u2019s wealth The truth is, much of McConnell\u2019s money comes from his secondwife, Elaine Chao, whom he married in 1993. (McConnell was married to his first wife, feminist scholar Sherrill Redmon, from 1968 until 1980.) Congressional financial disclosure forms cover both spouses if the lawmaker is married. Chao, who served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush, is the daughter of James S. C. Chao, the founder of a major international trade company. After immigrating to the United States from China in the 1960s, Mr.Chao founded Foremost Maritime Corporation -- now the Foremost Group, of which he is the chairman. We couldn\u2019t figure out exactly how much James Chao is worth. But the Chao Family Foundations recently donated $40 million to build a new executive education center at Harvard Business School. So how did McConnell\u2019s finances change when he married Elaine Chao? The good news is that elected officials are required to fill out public financial disclosure forms annually. The bad news is that the Senate Public Disclosure Office at the Capitol tosses out any forms that are more than six years old. However, we were able to access McConnell\u2019s disclosure forms back to 1995 through the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. And McConnell\u2019s campaign gave us the forms for 1994, 1993 and 1992. All congressional financial disclosure forms show assets, income and liabilities in broad value ranges. For example, if someone owns a piece of property worth $800,000, it will be categorized on the form as being valued between $500,000 and $1 million. For consistency, let\u2019s assume the maximum amount possible based on those broad ranges. In 1992 -- in the middle of his second term and the year before he married Chao -- McConnell had up to $825,000 in assets and about $46,000 in income (such as speaking fees and investment returns) on top of his Senate salary. He also had up to $300,000 in liabilities, such as property mortgages, bringing down his net worth. After marrying Chao in 1993, McConnell reported a maximum of $2.6 million in assets -- including a piece of real estate worth up to $1 million that belonged to Chao -- and $93,500 on top of his Senate income. He also had $815,000 in liabilities. And that same year, McConnell inherited his mother\u2019s estate. Fast-forwarding to 2012, his net worth -- $22.8 million -- was nearly three times higher than it was five years earlier (in 2007, it was $7.8 million). In 2008, as we found in McConnell's discloure forms from that year, he and his wifereceived a gift of between $5 million and $25 million after Chao\u2019s mother died. This apparently accounts for the bulk of the increase during that five-year period."

    "justification": "The claim that President Obama's healthcare plan creates a \"death panel\" or \"rationing board\" that will lead to denied care for current seniors is CONFLICTING. The evidence provided in the article disputes this claim in several ways:\n\n1. The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) is not an unelected, unaccountable body as claimed by Ryan. Its members are appointed by the President and approved by the Senate, and they can be removed for cause. They are also required to follow disclosure and ethics guidelines, and their recommendations can be rejected by Congress.\n2. The IPAB is not responsible for cutting Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors. While it is required to recommend cost-saving measures if Medicare grows too quickly, these recommendations can be overridden by Congress. Additionally, the law reduces Medicare's growth by more than $700 billion over the next 10 years, which would reduce the need for IPAB recommendations.\n3. The article notes that the board cannot ration care, change benefits, change eligibility, or increase what seniors pay. Therefore, it is unlikely that the board's recommendations would lead to denied care for current seniors.\n4. Even if the board were to make recommendations that reduced payments to providers, this would not necessarily lead to denied care for seniors. The article notes that some providers say they are underpaid already, and reducing payments to these providers could potentially affect their ability to provide care. However, it is not clear that this would lead to denied care for current seniors.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim about President Obama's healthcare plan creating a \"death panel\" or \"rationing board\" that will lead to denied care for current seniors is CONFLICTING. While there may be some potential issues with the IPAB and its recommendations, the evidence provided suggests that these concerns are overstated and do not accurately reflect the purpose and function of the board.",
    "doc": "Remember the discredited Republican attack that President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law created a \"rationing board\" or \"death panel\"?It\u2019s back \u2014 but with a softer edge. And it\u2019s coming from the architect of the lightning-rod Republican plan to turn Medicare into a program that pays for private insurance.Vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan claims an \"unelected, unaccountable\" board created by the health care law \"will lead to denied care for current seniors.\"His language is more measured than other claims we\u2019ve weighed over the years about Medicare\u2019s new Independent Payment Advisory Board. But did he reach the truth?Ryan trotted out the campaign line (and his Medicare-eligible mother, Betty) on Aug. 18, 2012, in retiree-heavy Florida community The Villages, and repeated it two days later in New Hampshire.\"Here's what the president won't tell you about his Medicare plan, about Obamacare,\" he said. \"The president raids $716 billion from the Medicare program to pay for the Obamacare program. What's more, in addition to that, he puts a board of 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in charge of Medicare, who are required to cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors.\"We\u2019ve evaluated versions of the $716 billion claim, finding that the amount wasn\u2019t \"raided\" or \"robbed\" but that the law reduces future spending through a series of cost-saving measures. (Meanwhile, Ryan\u2019s own House budget took advantage of the same savings he attacks.) Here we\u2019re checking Ryan\u2019s comments about the Independent Payment Advisory Board.\u2018Unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats\u2019The Independent Payment Advisory Board, slated to start work in 2013, was created by the health care law to put distance between politics and Medicare.(An evenhanded report from the Kaiser Family Foundation describes the board and its origin.)Its 15 full-time members aren\u2019t elected. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re unaccountable.\u2022They\u2019re appointed by the president and approved by the Senate.\u2022 They can\u2019t serve more than two six-year terms.\u2022 Their recommendations can be rejected by Congress.\u2022They must follow disclosure and ethics guidelines, and they can\u2019t perform other jobs as they serve.\u2022 They can be removed by the president for \"neglect of duty\" or \"malfeasance in office,\" though not for any other reason.Henry Aaron, an economist who specializes in health care and tax policy at the Brookings Institution, says they\u2019re accountable in the same sense that members of any federal regulatory commission are accountable \u2014 they serve fixed terms and can be removed for cause.But Gail Wilensky, a health economist who directed the Medicare and Medicaid programs from 1990 to 1992 under President George H.W. Bush, argues that all members of independent commissions, once appointed and confirmed \"are almost impossible to move or influence.\"By contrast, she says, other types of presidential appointees, such as Cabinet members, can be pressured to resign if they make serious mistakes.In addition to limiting the reasons a board member might be removed, lawmakers sought to insulate the board\u2019s decisions from special-interest lobbying.\u2022Its recommendations are fast-tracked in Congress and go into effect automatically if lawmakers fail to act.\u2022 Implementation of its recommendations isn\u2019t subject to administrative or judicial review.So, board members aren\u2019t elected, but while their decisions are protected by law, they are to some degree accountable. In particular, they could fail to win a second term, or get fired by the president.Are they bureaucrats?They become members of the bureaucracy by definition once they join the board. But they won\u2019t all start that way. The law specifies that members will represent a mix of different professions, from health finance and economics to health facility management to medicine.In other words, the same kind of people who might advise health care spending decisions outside of government.\u2018Required to cut Medicare\u2019If Medicare grows too quickly, the Independent Payment Advisory Board is required to recommend cuts. But it won\u2019t have as large an impact as you might imagine.Obama\u2019s health care law, the Affordable Care Act, reduces Medicare\u2019s growth by more than $700 billion over the next 10 years, as we noted above.How much savings will the board generate? Less than 4 percent of net Medicare savings in the law\u2019s first decade, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.Recommendations from the board probably wouldn\u2019t be necessary after that, according to Medicare\u2019s actuary. That\u2019s because it only has to recommend cuts in years that Medicare misses its growth targets. After 2019, other savings in the health care law, if allowed to take effect, would keep the program in check.So it\u2019s fair to say the bulk of the savings in the law are outside the board\u2019s purview.It\u2019s only if those other measures fail to keep Medicare spending on track that the board is required to recommend additional ways to save. Meanwhile, if Congress comes up with another way to achieve the savings, it could overrule the board\u2019s proposals.\u2018Denied care\u2019Ryan said the board would \"cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors.\"But by law, the board can\u2019t ration care. It can\u2019t change benefits. It can\u2019t change eligibility. It can\u2019t increase what seniors pay.So it\u2019s expected to cut payments to providers. That could be a problem, since some providers say they\u2019re underpaid already. New York Times and USA Today stories in 2009 and 2010, for example, feature doctors opting out of Medicare because of its low payment rates.How might that affect care? Imagine, say critics, being unable to find a nearby hospital or doctor who takes Medicare. Or discovering that payments for a particular service or procedure have been reduced.\"In that way, at least in theory, you could get actual denial of care,\" said Michael Tanner, a health care analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, who opposes the health care law.The Medicare actuary, Richard Foster, estimated that savings from the entire health care law would make about 15 percent of hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies unprofitable by 2019.That means, presumably, that to stay open they would need to shift costs to non-Medicare patients, merge with other providers or withdraw from Medicare, he said.That\u2019s one reason he\u2019s testified that growth reduction under the law isn\u2019t sustainable in the long range.It\u2019s \"a serious issue,\" said Wilensky, the Bush-era Medicare official.But that\u2019s the projected effect for the entire law. Meanwhile, the board itself is required to consider \"to the extent feasible\" how its recommendations would affect access to care, especially in rural and other underserved areas."

    "justification": "The claim that President Obama and his allies in Congress gave \"power\" to control Medicare patients' health care decisions to \"a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington\" is false. The evidence provided by PolitiFact Ohio refutes this assertion.\n\nFirstly, the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) is not a commission of unelected bureaucrats as claimed by Blackburn. According to the law, the members of IPAB shall include individuals with national recognition for their expertise in health finance and economics, actuarial science, health facility management, health plans and integrated delivery systems, reimbursement of health facilities, allopathic and osteopathic physicians, and other providers of health services, and other related fields, who provide a mix of different professionals, broad geographic representation, and a balance between urban and rural representatives (PolitiFact Ohio). This means that IPAB members are not unelected bureaucrats but rather experts in their respective fields.\n\nSecondly, the board is not empowered to make life-and-death decisions as claimed by Blackburn and Gingrey. The law states that IPAB cannot raise costs to Medicare recipients, much less kill them off by denying life-saving care (PolitiFact Georgia). Instead, IPAB's role is to recommend cost-savings proposals within a mandate that specifies it cannot ration care. The board might recommend, based on medical best practices, that every discharged hospital patient gets guidance on wound care or that they drink plenty of cold water (PolitiFact Georgia).\n\nThirdly, the claim that IPAB would make medical decisions for patients is false. According to Cato Institute, a libertarian thinktank usually at odds with Democratic positions, the assertion that the IPAB would be controlling patients health-care decisions is \"not even close to correct\" (PolitiFact Georgia). The board exists to rein in costs, a job Congress has repeatedly declined to undertake, as this Washington Post editorial, among others, has pointed out.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence provided by PolitiFact Ohio, Georgia, and Cato Institute refutes Blackburn's claim that President Obama and his allies in Congress gave \"power\" to control Medicare patients' health care decisions to \"a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington.\" IPAB members are not unelected bureaucrats, but rather experts in their respective fields. Additionally, the board is not empowered to make life-and-death decisions or control patients' health care decisions. Therefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "As the U.S. Supreme Court, after three days of oral arguments, moves toward determining the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, we note that U.S.Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., has again weighed in on one of its provisions. Like many other Republicans, she is attacking the Independent Payment Advisory Board created in the legislation and voted to repeal the provision last month. The board is intended to rein in Medicare costs beginning in 2015 with Congress required to either accede to its recommendations or act to overrule them.Specifically, Blackburn said: \"Instead of giving patients control of their health care decisions, the President and his allies in Congress chose to delegate this power to a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington.\"We asked Blackburn spokesman Mike Reynard for evidence backing the claim and he referred to Section 3403 of the law where the board is established and to an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. Ryan said the board would be \"empowered by the new health-care law to cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for seniors.\"Our PolitFact Ohio colleagues took a look at a similar assertion about the IPAB by the former \"Tutti Frutti\" crooner Pat Boone on March 11 and rated it a \"Pants on Fire\" distortion of the truth.Closer to what Blackburn said about the IPAB are the statements PolitiFact national looked at from of U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and PolitiFact Georgia looked at from U.S. Rep. Phil G Gingrey, R-Ga., the latter an obstetrician-gynecologist. Both suggested the IPAB\u2019s \"bureaucrats\" would make medical decisions for patients. In both instances, those assertions were rated False.PolitiFact Georgia asked four different health experts about Gingrey\u2019s claim that \"a bunch of bureaucrats\" would \"decide whether you get care.\" All four said Gingrey was wrong. Cato Institute, a libertarian thinktank usually at odds with Democratic positions, said that the assertion that the IPAB would be controlling patients health-care decisions is \"not even close to correct.\" Cato scholar Michael Tanner is himself an opponent of IPAB but nonetheless said: \"It [IPAB] has nothing to do with individual care at all. It\u2019s not making decisions on individuals.\"The letter of the law shows the board has nothing to do with individual patients or their health care decisions, but would suggest cost-savings proposals within a mandate that specifies it cannot ration care. The board might recommend, based on medical best practices, that every discharged hospital patient get guidance on wound care or that they drink plenty of cold water. They might find that surgery to install certain medical devices \u2013 like hip replacements \u2013 should not be done on Medicare beneficiaries over the age of 105. The goal is cost-savings, not micro-managing patient care.Blackburn couches her statement about the IPAB in the context of physicians cutting back on the number of Medicare patients they treat and suggests that, with the IPAB, \"this problem will only get worse, leaving our seniors without the necessary access to physicians they deserve.\"This overstates the case. Some physicians are not taking on new Medicare patients for a variety of reasons, including low reimbursement rates. And it\u2019s true the board could recommend lower rates for some procedures and discourage more doctors from taking on new patients. But the board is mandated to do so on a medically sound basis. The board exists to rein in costs, a job Congress has repeatedly declined to undertake, as this Washington Post editorial, among others, has pointed out.Gingrey also made an assertion that the board will be stocked with \"unelected bureaucrats,\" and said it would be capable of making life-and-death decisions. That was found to be just not false but outrageous by PolitiFact Georgia. \"This claim is incorrect,\" it said \"The IPAB does not have anything close to the power that Gingrey suggests. It cannot raise costs to Medicare recipients, much less kill them off by denying life-saving care.\"Blackburn\u2019s claim that the IPAB will consist of \"15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington,\" like Bachmann\u2019s grievance that the IPAB consists of political appointees, \"leaves out a lot of detail of the law\u2019s requirements,\" as PolitiFact National put it in its check of Bachmann\u2019s claims about the IPAB.The law states that the members \"shall include individuals with national recognition for their expertise in health finance and economics, actuarial science, health facility management, health plans and integrated delivery systems, reimbursement of health facilities, allopathic and osteopathic physicians, and other providers of health services, and other related fields, who provide a mix of different professionals, broad geographic representation and a balance between urban and rural representatives.\"It also says the board \"shall also include representatives of consumers and the elderly.\"And, it says individuals who are directly involved in providing or managing health care \"shall not\" constitute a majority of the board\u2019s members.The president appoints 15 members, who undergo confirmation by the Senate, and there are three ex-oficio members.Once appointed to the board, the members become full-time government employees and are not allowed to hold other full-time employment."

    "doc": "U.S. Rep. Charlie Bass survived a challenge from four opponents in this week\u2019s Republican primary. But, even as the election approached, Bass was already focusing his attacks more on his Democratic challenger, Concord attorney Ann McLane Kuster.In an ad released August 27, 2012, Bass, a Peterborough Republican, attacks Kuster, his opponent in the 2010 campaign, for being a hyper-liberal partisan, citing her support for the national health care reform law as evidence.\"She supports the government takeover of healthcare, which robs Medicare of over $700 billion,\" a narrator says in the ad, titled \"Not Working.\"\"Annie, that\u2019s not working together,\" the narrator scolds. \"That\u2019s not working for any of us.\"Kuster, who lostto Bass by 1.6 percent of the vote in the 2010 campaign, has been outspoken in her support of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. In August of 2010, as referenced in Bass\u2019 ad,she told WMUR-TV\"I think health care reform was a historic first step.\"\"Thirty million Americans will now have health insurance \u2026 and we've prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage right when you need it most,\" she said at the time.But, does her support for the Affordable Care Act really translate to support for a government takeover of health care? And does the health care law really \"rob\" $700 billion from Medicare?According to past PolitiFact rulings, the answer is no.In past rulings, PolitiFact has disagreed strongly with the classification of the Affordable Care Act as a government takeover of healthcare. In recent months, these rulings have ranged fromFalsetoPants on Fire, and in 2010, PolitiFact editors named the claim itsLie of the Year.In that ruling, PolitiFact reported that the term \"government takeover\" refers to a European approach where the government owns the hospitals and doctors are public employees. By contrast, under the Affordable Care Act, the government will not take control of hospitals or doctors. Employers will continue to provide health insurance to most patients through private insurance companies, and the law does not include a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers, the article noted.\"The label 'government takeover\u2019 has no basis in reality, but instead reflects a political dynamic where conservatives label any increase in government authority in health care as a \u2018takeover.,\" Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said at the time.Looking to the second part of Bass\u2019 statement, PolitiFact has also taken issue with similar claims about the Affordable Care Act robbing Medicare.Last month, for instance, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney earned aMostly False ratingfor his claim that Obama \"robbed Medicare (of) $716 billion to pay for for a new risky program of his own that we call Obamacare.\" In this fact-check,PolitiFact noted that neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut any money from the Medicare budget.Instead, the law included a number of changes seeking to lower future Medicare costs. Initially, the Congressional Budget Office estimated those reductions to total about$507 billionbetween 2012 and 2021. But, more recently, the CBO updated its projected reductions to about$716 billionbetween 2013 and 2022.Bass references this updated figure in his attack on Kuster, but neither in his ad, nor in Romney\u2019s claim, can these spending reductions be reasonably considered \"robbing.\"As noted in the Romney piece, Democrats included the Medicare cuts in the law to avoid adding to the deficit, and the proposal was debated in the open for many weeks as it made its way through Congress.Several days after his initial claim, Romney made another reference to the Medicare cuts, this time says that the president\u2019s plan \"cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare.\"PolitiFact rated that statementHalf True, saying that, although Romney\u2019s got his numbers right, his claim suggests that the law re-routes funding already allocated to Medicare to finance the health care law. As noted before, the law works to reduce future Medicare spending and frees up savings that are then used to offset the costs of the health care law.As a sidenote, PolitiFact has also ruled that Romney\u2019s vice presidential nominee, U.S. Rep Paul Ryan,relies on the same $700 billion in Medicare savings in his own budget plan."

    "justification": "The claim that the proposed Austin school district bond issue will \"require no tax rate increase\" is supported by the evidence provided. The district's analysis assumes an annual increase in total assessed property values of 1.5 percent in the first two years and 7 percent thereafter, which is conservative and appropriate, according to school leaders and financial advisors. The district also plans to draw on reserves and use other funds to pay for the bond issuance, which will help keep the tax rate flat. Additionally, the district's worst-case modeling indicates that even if total assessed property values grow more than expected, the increase in the debt portion of the district tax rate will be less than the increase in the taxes paid by homeowners. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it is accurate to say that the proposed bond issue will not result in a tax rate increase.",
    "doc": "A handout urging voter support for a proposed $1.05 billion Austin school district bond issue on the November 2017 ballot singles out the need to repair and renovate schools averaging 40 years of age plus a desire to modernize or build 16 schools. Moreover, the handout from the Committee of Austin\u2019s Children PAC says: \"Did you know? AISD Prop. 1 bonds will require no tax rate increase,\" a claim the group also makes on its website. Is that rate statement accurate? To rehash, the handout says the sought bonds won\u2019t require a \"rate\" increase. It\u2019s silent on whether district residents will pay more in taxes if the proposition passes--which struck Austin lawyer Bill Aleshire, formerly Travis County\u2019s elected judge, as misleading. Aleshire, who brought the handout to our attention, said by email: \"No one in their right mind should believe AISD can borrow $1 billion plus interest and not have a property tax increase as a result.\" When we asked, David Butts, a consultant to the PAC, told us by phone the group based its rate claim on district presentations. Butts said: \"We\u2019ve never said that you wouldn\u2019t pay higher taxes,\" in that barring an economic recession, escalating local property values stand to drive up how much the district reaps--without the district needing a rate bump. Property taxes are tied to assessed property values which in Austin (like other prosperous cities) lately spiral nearly every year. In this fact-check, we\u2019ll share assumptions behind the no-hike scenario and unpack estimates of how much money the proposed bonds would likely cost homeowners in increased tax bills. It\u2019s also worth noting the speculative quality of tax predictions. To our inquiry, Roger Falk of the Travis County Taxpayers Union, which opposes the proposition, questioned anyone\u2019s ability to fact-check rate-related claims because, he said by phone, tax effects depend on unknowns including whether and how much total appraised property values change and if the district\u2019s intended debt repayment schedules and interest rates bear out. \"You cannot assume it\u2019s a sunny day every day,\" Falk said. \"It\u2019s going to rain sometime.\" Austin district\u2019s assumptions District leaders have said that presuming total assessed property values continue to increase and also that the district repays more than half the proposed debt within a decade, the school board will be spared from considering an increase in the district\u2019s total tax rate of $1.192 per $100 valuation--the bulk of which covers day-to-day maintenance and operations. A September 2017 Austin American-Statesman news story elaborated: \"The district points to its last bond election \u2014 $392 million approved by voters in 2013 \u2014 as an example of how it can tamp down the impact on property tax bills. Those bonds were expected to raise the tax rate by 3 cents, or about $38.40 a year to the property tax bill for a $200,000 home. \"But instead,\" the story said, \"the district, buoyed by increasing property values, lowered the tax rate by 5 cents per $100 of a home\u2019s assessed value. Homeowners are still paying more, of course, because property values in Austin have shot up 12 percent a year, on average, for the past five years.\" Tiffany Young, a district spokeswoman, emailed us the district\u2019s August 2017 \"tax capacity analysis\" of the proposed bond costs, which included a summary of annual changes--of late 11-percent-plus annual increases--in total assessed property valuations in the district from 2008 through 2017: SOURCE: Document showing tax capacity analysis of proposed bond debt, Austin Independent School District, Aug. 10, 2017 (received by email from Tiffany Young, senior communication specialist, AISD, Sept. 26, 2017) That news story noted that the district\u2019s payback plan for the proposed bond package assumes an annual increase in total assessed property values of 7 percent in the first two years and 1.5 percent for each subsequent year. \"Property values actually have a 10-year average growth rate of nearly 8 percent,\" the story said. School leaders advised that if there\u2019s a flattening in property-value increases, the district could tap $46 million in reserves, or savings, to make up for lost revenue. Also, the story quoted Ellen Wood, who chairs the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce\u2019s board of directors, calling district assumptions behind no tax-rate hike prediction \"conservative and appropriate.\" By phone, Wood told us chamber members based that judgment on talks with the district\u2019s chief financial officer, Nicole Conley Johnson, and a firm advising the district on the proposed issuance. To our inquiries, Conley Johnson reaffirmed the district\u2019s conclusion that the proposed bonds can be paid off without a tax-rate hike. In fact, Conley Johnson said by phone, she expects the district to land interest rates perhaps 2 percentage points less than the 5 percent rate assumed in its modeling, a decrease that would reduce repayment costs. Noting increased assessed property valuations in recent years, Conley Johnson also said it\u2019s reasonable to expect assessed values to surge more each year than the 1.5 percent rate assumed in the modeling past the first couple years. If theproposition fails at the polls, Conley Johnson confirmed, the school board could reduce the debt portion of the district tax rate in 2021-22 by $0.0297 per $100 valuation to $0.0833 with additional reductions doable most subsequent years through 2039-40--though that scenario depends, perhaps improbably, on no additional costs accumulating in the intervening years. If the proposition passes, Conley Johnson said, in 2022, the district will need some $35.5 million to pay incremental costs on the proposed bonds. An estimated $35.5 million would be raised by from that $0.0297 per $100 valuation in tax rate, the district projects. Worst-case scenarios? We separately asked Conley Johnson and Chris Allen of First Southwest, the firm hired by the district as financial advisers on the proposition, to lay out a worst-case scenario that might cause district officials to recommend a rate increase after all. \"You\u2019d have to have a major economic downturn,\" Allen said by phone. \"You\u2019d have to have the housing market plummet.\" Allen, referring to the district\u2019s assumed 7 percent increases in total assessed valuations in both 2019 and 2020, said: \"I think the 7 percent is conservative. If you look around, there are cranes everywhere. The housing\" and commercial \"market is on fire.\" Conley Johnson said by email: \"We estimate that if\" total assessed valuation \"growth stayed flat for the next 8 years or there was a cumulative decline in AV of 20%, we would need to consider increasing the tax rate. Of course.\" she said, \"these events would buck historical trends of the last 10 years where there was only year that AV declined, in 2011 due to the national recession--arguably the worst in history. Even still, there was subsequent growth thereafter and the decline was made-up after two years and growth doubled after that.\" Falk, the proposition foe, questioned the assumption that the district can repay the bonds at a 5 percent interest rate past this next year. \"There\u2019s no science--no way to know--past one year,\" Falk said. Falk called the assumed annual increases in total property valuations a \"best guess.\" We also asked Charles Gilliland, a land-market expert at Texas A&M University, to evaluate the no-rate-increase claim. Gilliland said by phone the district\u2019s post-2020 assumption that total assessed property values will increase 1.5 percent annually seems \"pretty conservative. The rest of the story is it\u2019s not going to be a nice steady increase,\" Gilliland said. \"There are going to be ups and downs.\" Generally, Gilliland said by email: \"Without exhaustive historical studies of the parameters of their model and an examination of the operating conditions of the district, I have no evidence to cast doubt on the assumptions underlying the\" district\u2019s analysis. Costs to taxpayers Falk called the tax-rate claim by itself a \"head fake\" intended to dupe voters into overlooking that each taxpayer would be paying more dollars to cover bond repayments. He also emailed us the taxpayer group\u2019s analysis, which provides estimated effects on property tax bills by assuming that total assessed valuations within district boundaries won\u2019t go up or down. Then again, the district has acknowledged that property owners will pay more in taxes to pay debt service on the bonds, if approved. A June 2017 American-Statesman news story on school board members voting to place the proposition before voters initially noted that district officials said the tax rate would remain flat at $1.192 per $100 of assessed property value, with $1.079 designated for operations and $0.113 of the rate going toward repaying debt issued to fund capital improvements. Still: \"For the owner of the district\u2019s average taxable value home of $355,947, the school tax bills would total nearly $4,243. As properties increase in value,\" the story said, \"that same tax rate would lead to increasingly higher tax bills.\" District web pages devoted to the proposition similarly indicate property owners will likely face increases in what the district bills. We initially spotted no estimates of how much more, but estimates were provided when we asked. Let\u2019s cover those web posts, then turn to what the district gave us. Here\u2019s a question on the district\u2019s main FAQ section about the proposition: \"I've heard AISD say this bond will not raise my property tax rate. How is that possible?\" The 202-word reply stresses the district\u2019s plan not to issue the sought debt all at once plus plans to draw on other funds; it doesn\u2019t concede additional direct-to-taxpayer bond costs. We saw this question on a separate district Finance FAQ web page about the proposition: \"So does this mean that I won\u2019t have an increase in my tax bill?\" The district\u2019s reply opens, \"No.\" That reply otherwise says higher taxes depend on the appraised value of taxable property, \"which is determined by the\" Travis Central Appraisal District, \"not AISD. An increase or decrease in taxable property value, even with no change in the tax rate, would result in an increase or decrease in the actual amount of taxes paid.\" The reply goes on to note that residents who qualify for Travis County\u2019s over-65 homestead exemption wouldn\u2019t pay more in school taxes. Moreover, the reply continues, other governing entities levy property taxes including the city of Austin, Travis County, the Austin Community College District and the Travis County Health Care District. \"The rates for each entity are set annually by the elected or governing officials,\" the district says. \"The rate for each of the taxing entities is then applied to your home value,\" it says. We also noticed the last, 18th question on the district\u2019s main FAQ page for the proposition: \"What's the bottom line, the one thing you want voters to know?\" The district\u2019s reply: \"AISD needs to address facility deficiencies and is committed to creating 21st-century learning spaces for our students. We can do so without a tax rate increase.\" Conley Johnson told us that in 2021-22 (the third year of the district starting to sell and repay the bond debt being presented to voters), the cost to taxpayers of the new debt would range from $29.70 for the owner of a property with an assessed value of $100,000 up to $297 for the owner of a property with an assessed value of $1 million. See the district\u2019s full chart here. According to what Conley Johnson described as the district\u2019s worst-case modeling of the proposed bonds\u2019 effect on taxes, the owner of an Austin homestead at the average 2017-18 assessed value ($332,103) would see the debt portion of her or his district tax bill increase from $375 in 2017-18 to $484 in 2027-28--driven by expected bumps in assessed property values. Absent the sought bonds or other approved debt, this modeling indicates, the 2027-28 costs to such a homeowner for district debt would total $250.57. An owner of a homestead at the 2017-18 median value ($262,282) would face $382.75 in district debt-tied taxes in 2027-28--up from $296 in 2017-18 and greater than the $197.89 in such taxes the homeowner would face if the district doesn\u2019t issue additional debt. There\u2019s more: As we made our inquiries, the district posted a document estimating each homesteading homeowner\u2019s future tax payments to the district related to paying off the proposed bonds. Upshot: Starting in 2022, some $0.0297 per $100 valuation of the district\u2019s tax rate would generate sufficient revenue to pay debt service on the sought bonds, the document says. The share of the district\u2019s tax rate needed to pay that debt service will escalate in subsequent years, the document says, with that share reaching its maximum of $0.0530 per $100 valuation as of 2029. According to the document, the district estimates the dollar costs in annual taxes on the median-value homestead in the district--which in 2017 had an appraised value of $287,282--to be $77.90 in 2022 and $139.01 in 2029. At the upper end, the estimated annual dollar costs due to debt service on the proposed bonds to a homestead appraised at $1 million in 2017 is shown as $289.58 in 2022, $516.75 in 2029."

    "doc": "Nevada Democrats are champing at the bit to take on first-term Republican U.S. Rep. Cresent Hardy. Hardy represents just one of a handful of Republican-held House seats that lean Democratic, and his is widely considered one of the most \"flippable\" seats in 2016. The district includes parts of North Las Vegas and stretches across southern Nevada. Several high-profile Democrats have announced their candidacy, and attacks are already flying in one of the most-watched and well-funded congressional races in the country. Former Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, who made waves after endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders for president, has aggressively gone after State Sen. Ruben Kihuen, who is generally considered the frontrunner after gaining the support of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and the state\u2019s powerful Culinary Union. At a January candidate forum in rural Pahrump, Nev, Flores portrayed Kihuen (pronounced KEY-WIN) as an ineffective lawmaker and attacked his record, including a signature bill passed in 2015 expanding low-income college scholarships. \"Frankly, he only managed in the minority to get one bill passed out of the eight to 10 that he introduced,\" she said. \"And the college bill was actually primarily sponsored by the Republican majority leader, so of course the Republican majority leader wasn\u2019t going to let that bill fail.\" We thought her claim merited fact-checking. Kihuen\u2019s legislative record has been scrutinized since 2011, when the Las Vegas Sun pointed out he was one of two lawmakers who did not introduce a single bill in the legislative session. The Flores campaign pointed to that article, and provided a list of bills that Kihuen introduced during the 2015 legislative session as evidence of Kihuen\u2019s ineffectiveness. (The Nevada Legislature only meets for six months every two years.) Flores\u2019 allegation is mostly on the mark. Of the eight bills introduced by Kihuen in 2015, only one was ultimately signed into law \u2014 a bill allowing the county commissioners in Las Vegas to propose up to a $14 fee on marriage licenses to promote marriage tourism. But she misidentifies the co-sponsor of arguably Kihuen\u2019s biggest legislative accomplishment. (Flores owned up to the mistake after the forum.) Kihuen worked closely with Republican Assistant Majority Leader Ben Kieckhefer in passing the state\u2019s first need-based college scholarship program. The \"Silver State Opportunity Grant Program\" allocates $5 million over two years for low-income students enrolled in Nevada community colleges and universities, and more than 670 students are signed up. Kieckhefer said the bill originated from a college affordability summit hosted by the two before the legislative session, and he credited Kihuen for helping push the legislation through with minimal opposition. \"Ruben and I were partners on this bill, and I know he worked it hard on his side,\" he said. Flores\u2019s comments also strike at a larger issue - finding the best way to measure legislative effectiveness. Kihuen\u2019s campaign manager, Dave Chase, said because Democrats were in the minority during the session, it makes more sense to measure effectiveness by what Kihuen was able to prevent from happening. \"The real work comes in committee and on the floor, where Ruben, while in the minority, fought to kill reckless Republican bills that would have ended collective bargaining, overtime pay and rolled back key voting rights all while passing 19 bills he sponsored,\" he wrote in an email. \"Ms. Flores should ask the 700 students going to college right now thanks to Ruben's work if he was effective last session.\" Kihuen servedas part of the leadership team for the 10-person Democratic caucus, and Senate Democratic head Aaron Ford praised Kihuen\u2019s work during the legislative session. As for the critical 2011 article in the Sun, Damore said he was \"hesitant\" to lend much credence to a five-year old article and recommended looking at Kihuen\u2019s more recent legislative accomplishments. A full list is here. Six of the ten bills introduced by Kihuen during the 2013 session were eventually signed into law. UNLV political science professor David Damore said it\u2019s difficult to measure legislative effectiveness based solely on the raw numbers of bills proposed and laws that are passed. \"Certainly factors such as majority or minority status as well as seniority play into passage, and of course not every bill that gets passed should be become law, and not all that do have an equal impact,\" he said in an email. Nevada lawmakers are also limited as to the number of bills they can propose during the session, so legislators can\u2019t propose dozens of bills to pad their numbers."

    "doc": "Imagine never having to make the monotonous drive on Interstate 70 again to get from St. Louis to Kansas City, or vice versa. Imagine taking less than 30 minutes out of your day to make the trip. If Hyperloop One builds a routein Missouri, that\u2019d be a reality. Hyperloop is a transportation system that functions like a high-tech train, moving people in tubes from city to city at speeds similar to air travel. Patrick McKenna, director of the Missouri Department of Transportation, said Missouri is an appealing candidate for a Hyperloop route. \"Officials at Hyperloop One have referred to the route as one of the best they\u2019ve ever seen,\" he told the Kansas City Business Journal on Oct. 19. But did Hyperloop One officials say the St. Louis-Kansas City route is one of the best they\u2019ve seen? What is Hyperloop? Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX,published a white paper for Hyperloop in 2013, which was presented to former President Barack Obama later that year. According to its website, Hyperloop Technologies Inc.was established in Los Angeles in 2014. Earlier this year, the company successfully tested its propulsion system with the car in the tube, and the company projects three Hyperloop systems will be completed by 2021. Essentially, Hyperloop utilizes magnetic accelerators in a low-pressure tube system in order to propel rotors in individual capsules. The vehicles hover slightly off the track in the tube through magnetic levitation. This special environment allows a blazing top speed of 670 mph. Missouri efforts In May 2016,Hyperloop One opened its Global Challenge, urging cities and regions around the world to submit their pitches for a Hyperloop network. More than 2,600 proposals were sent to Hyperloop. Missouri submitted its application that fall, and was named as one of the 35 semifinalists in February 2017. We reached out to Hyperloop One officials, who didn\u2019t respond, and to the Missouri Department of Transportation. Special assignment coordinator Robert Brendel directed us to links about the challenge. On Sept. 14, 2017, Hyperloop announced its winners via a press release. Even though it didn\u2019t win, the Missouri route was designated as one of 11 finalists invited to continue developing the proposal. In response to being named a finalist, state officials established the Missouri Hyperloop Coalition in October to continue the conversation. The coalition includes MoDOT, the University of Missouri System, St. Louis Regional Chamber and the KC Tech Council. Dan Katz, Hyperloop\u2019s director of global public policy,told the St. Louis Post-Dispatchthat the creation of the coalition helped the Missouri route\u2019s future chances. \"They were on the edge in that competition,\" Katz told the newspaper. Now, he said, \"they are as competitive\" as any on the initial list. The company had previously weighed in as part of Missouri\u2019s aggressive pitch for attracting Amazon to either St. Louis or Kansas City for its second headquarters. Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd is featured in a short video about the potential for the transportation system in the state, which is available on thestate\u2019s Amazon HQ pitch website. The video is sponsored by the state\u2019s Department of Economic Development, but the praise comes from Lloyd himself."

    "doc": "Insurance providers are \"fleeing\" Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges, President Donald Trump said at a March 13 \"listening session\" on health care. \"One-third of the counties \u2014 think of it, one-third \u2014 only have one insurer left,\" Trump said, adding that the Republican replacement for the 2010 health care law known as Obamacare will have \"far more choices, at a lower cost.\" Trump has the right statistic about insurance provider participation. In 32 percent of counties, individuals looking to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act online marketplace have just one choice for their insurance provider, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, last updated in November 2016. In several states, including Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming, there\u2019s only one insurance provider total participating in each state\u2019s online marketplace in 2017. That\u2019s a significant change from 2016, when just 7 percent of counties \u2014 and one state, Wyoming \u2014 were limited to one insurance provider on the online exchanges. On the other end of the spectrum, Wisconsin has 15 insurance providers participating in the exchanges in 2017, and Ohio has 11. It\u2019s important to note that Trump\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t mean one-third of people have only one provider to choose from for health insurance. Because rural and sparsely populated areas tend to have lower competition, about 21 percent, or one-fifth, of exchange enrollees live in these counties where there\u2019s only one insurance provider to choose from, according to Kaiser. So of the approximately 9.2 million people enrolled in the Affordable Care Act exchanges in 2017, about 1.9 million could only purchase insurance from one company. These individuals could still buy insurance outside the marketplace and from another provider. But if they did so, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get a federal subsidy to defray the cost. Insurance companies that have dropped from the exchanges \u2014 including UnitedHealthGroup, Humana and Aetna \u2014 have said they were losing money by participating. Among plans offered on the exchanges, costs have gone way up. Looking at a standard measurement used by the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 what a family of four with a household income of $60,000 would pay for premiums on the second-lowest-cost silver plan \u2014 average premiums for this type of plan rose by 38 percent between 2014 and 2017. \"Of course, everyone would like to see more competition in the marketplaces \u2014 that's important for keeping costs down,\" said Sherry Glied, dean of New York University\u2019s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. \"But there has always been a recognition that there would be more competition in some places than others.\" Glied added that individual insurance markets in many states were highly concentrated before the Affordable Care Act, too."

    "justification": "The claim that \"Starting in December 2007, '1.4 million jobs were created in Texas. In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs'\" is True. The evidence provided in the article supports this claim.\n\nFirstly, the article quotes Rick Perry, the former Governor of Texas, who boasted about the state's job creation record during his tenure. According to Perry, Texas created almost one-third of all the nation's new jobs, with a total of 441,000 jobs created in the last year alone. This is supported by figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which show that Texas saw civilian employment balloon by 1.36 million jobs from December 2007 to October 2014, while the rest of the country saw a gain of 0.26% and more than 350,000 jobs below the December 2007 level.\n\nSecondly, the article provides a chart showing that based on total employment, which includes all jobs including self-employed posts, Texas had 1,410,400 more jobs in November 2014 than it had in December 2007, while the rest of the country had 352,440 fewer jobs. This further supports the claim that Texas created more jobs than the rest of the country during the specified period.\n\nFinally, the article quotes Mark J. Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan campus in Flint, who notes that Texas never experienced significant job losses during the Great Recession while the rest of the country did. This suggests that Texas' job creation record is particularly impressive compared to the rest of the country during this period.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that Texas created significantly more jobs than the rest of the country during the period starting in December 2007. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim.",
    "doc": "Rick Perry reminded lawmakers in his last speech to them before ending more than a decade as governor that he\u2019s proud of Texas job gains on his watch \u2014 and the rest of the country lost jobs in recent years, he said. \"I have been guided by a simple philosophy: That job creation, not higher taxation, is the best form of revenue generation,\" Perry said in his Jan. 15, 2015, speech. \"And we have created jobs. In the last year, we have created 441,000 jobs. Since I became governor, with your help, we have created almost one-third of all the nation\u2019s new jobs.\" Those figures hold up if you get your wording straight. We found True Perry\u2019s past claim to Texas\u2019 accounting for one third of net new jobs in the country. As we checked this latest statement, analyst David Cooper of the liberal Economic Policy Institute crunched the latest federal figures and told us Texas jobs accounted for 27 percent of the net jobs gained in the 43 states that gained jobs since 2000. \"Still pretty impressive,\" Cooper said by phone. In his speech, Perry added accurately: \"The unemployment rate in Texas is significantly below the national average. And right here in Austin, Texas, it\u2019s below 4 percentage points.\" Then Perry said: \"In fact, if you look at the last seven years\u2026starting in December of 2007, you will see that 1.4 million jobs were created in Texas. In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.\" That much of a Texas/Not-Texas gulf? By email, Perry spokesman Felix Browne pointed out U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures for Texas and other states and encouraged us to consult Mark J. Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan campus in Flint. Professor Perry wrote in a November 2014 online commentary that from December 2007, the start of the national recession, through October 2014, Texas saw civilian employment balloon by 1.36 million jobs. \"In contrast,\" he wrote, \"civilian employment in the other 49 states without Texas is still 0.26% and more than 350,000 jobs below the December 2007 level \u2026 \u2014 there were 134.9 million non-Texas jobs in October vs. 135.26 million in December 2007.\" To our query, the scholar emailed a chart showing that based on what the government calls \"total employment,\" covering all jobs including self-employed posts, Texas had 1,410,400 more jobs in November 2014 than it had in December 2007 while the rest of the country had 352,440 fewer jobs. Total employment, he said, serves as a comprehensive indicator and is used to calculate unemployment rates. Mark Perry said the likely reason the latest figures weren\u2019t perfectly echoed in the governor\u2019s speech is the BLS recently revised upward U.S. jobs for November 2014, which had the effect of reducing the number of jobs lost outside of Texas in the cited period. A little more: The BLS says the definition of employment in the federal household survey, which the governor relied on for his comparison, \"comprises wage and salary workers (including domestics and other private household workers), self-employed persons and unpaid workers who worked 15 hours or more during the reference week in family-operated enterprises. Employment in both agricultural and nonagricultural industries is included.\" In contrast, the government's oft-quoted payroll survey of employers \"covers only wage and salary employees on the payrolls of nonfarm establishments.\" Cooper of EPI commented to us that the timeframe singled out by the governor may deliver a more glowing contrast for Texas than other periods. According to the government\u2019s payroll surveys, he said, the country has added 9.1 million jobs since June 2009, the acknowledged end of the national recession, with Texas accounting for 1.5 million of the additions. Significantly, he said, the rest of the country as a whole lost jobs from June 2009 until February 2010. Since then, he said, the U.S. has added more than 10 million jobs with Texas (again) accounting for more than 1 million of them. Professor Perry said that in his view, the best comparison of Texas to the rest of the nation starts in December 2007. His point: \"Texas never experienced significant job losses during the Great Recession, while the rest of the country did,\" he emailed. \"Therefore, comparing job gains since June 2009 or Feb. 2010 really won\u2019t make much sense. Of course the non-Texas US gained a lot of jobs since June 2009, and more than Texas, but that\u2019s because Texas never lost any (very many) jobs in 2008 and 2009 like the rest of the country. Texas is a great economic success story, and an anomaly vs. the rest of the country regarding job losses/gains,\" he wrote. Separately, we asked a Dallas-based analyst about the governor\u2019s claim. Cheryl Abbot of the BLS said by email the claim could have been precise by referring to \"total civilian employment\" rather than jobs. That said, as of November 2014, Abbot said, 24 other states had yet to reach pre-recession employment levels. \"On a statewide basis, Texas by far leads all states, with total civilian employment growth of 1,410,440. California is a distant second with civilian (household) employment growth of 452,763,\" Abbot wrote."

The project represents the unique cultural leverage of theater in its attempt to inspire the public\u2019s imagination and curiosity about basic science and its relation to their everyday lives.\" Topousis continued: \"This venture, like other more traditional NSF-funded informal science education projects (e.g., interactive science exhibits, IMAX films, science-based television programming), aims to educate through a focus on understanding the scientific method, its applications, and its unique ability to extract knowledge about our complex natural world. It presents the pursuit of fundamental knowledge through basic research in a neutral manner that does not advocate any position regarding climate change or conservation research,\" she said. A foundation summary of the grant award, brought to our attention by Topousis and Zach Kurz, staff spokesman for the Republican side of Smith\u2019s committee, states that a grant totaling $697,177 was awarded in 2010 covering August 2010 through July 2014. Play description The summary describes \"The Great Immensity\" as a \"touring play with songs and video that explores our relationship to the environment, with a focus on critical issues of climate change and biodiversity conservation.\" \"The play has been created with a network of partners including the Princeton Environmental Institute and Princeton Atelier Program/Lewis Arts Center, which will maintain an ongoing relationship with the project,\" the summary says, continuing: \"The play uses real places and stories drawn from interviews conducted by the artists to create an experience that is part investigative journalism and part inventive theater. Attendance at the performances is projected to be about 75,000.\" The summary also says: \"A major goal of the project is to help the public better appreciate how science studies the Earth's biosphere and to promote an inquisitive curiosity about our place in the natural world. The initiative also intends to create and evaluate a new model for how theater can increase public awareness, knowledge, and engagement with important science-related societal issues.\" Also, the summary says, the project will lead to the \"development and testing of online content, podcasts, and videos as well as special community education and outreach efforts in each community where the play is staged. Performances will be accompanied by post-performance panel discussions with the artists, local scientists and policy makers. After the completion of the initial tour, the play will be published, licensed, and made available to other theaters to produce independently.\" Tickets on sale By phone, Sarah Benvenuti, an administrator for the Civilian Theater Co., said the play is slated to run April 11-May 1, 2014, at the Public Theater\u2019s Martinson Hall in New York, which is not on Broadway. Tickets will be $20 each, she said. Benvenuti said the play is about climate change and includes musical numbers, which one can view in online videos. \"Margin of Error,\" for instance, shows cast members singing about poll results. (Really.) We wondered if the presentation is explicit, say, about human contributions to warming. Benevenuti didn\u2019t say, though she stressed that the play draws on direct conversations with expert scientists. \"Climate change is a real thing,\" she said. \"We have to do something about it.\" The script is not published, she said, but she pointed out the Public Theater\u2019s online description of the play as a \"continent-hopping thriller following a woman, Phyllis, as she pursues her husband Karl who disappeared from a tropical island while on an assignment for a nature show. Through her search,\" the summary says, \"Phyllis uncovers a mysterious plot surrounding the upcoming international climate summit in Paris. As the days count down to the summit, Phyllis must decipher the plan and possibly stop it in time. With arresting projected film and video and a wide-ranging score of songs,\" the play \"is a highly theatrical look into one of the most vital questions of our time: how can we change ourselves and our society in time to solve the enormous environmental challenges that confront us?\" Finally, we circled back to the foundation to ask if the musical was an unusual grant beneficiary. Topousis replied by email that while the NSF \"research portfolio this falls under--Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL)--contains projects at the intersection of science and the arts, NSF\u2019s funding this kind of project--a theatrical production--is rare.\""

    "doc": "Members of Congress recently decamped to their home districts for the August recess, but the never-ending partisan skirmishing on Capitol Hill continues. Many readers told us they saw references on social media to a comment by Rep. Lynn Jenkins, R-Kan., about House-passed bills dying on the doorstep of the Senate. They asked us to take a closer look, so we did. Here\u2019s the full text of Jenkins\u2019 comments, made at a press conference on July 29, 2014, as the final week of the congressional session was winding down: \"The president is fond of referring to the House as the \u2018do-nothing Congress.\u2019 But we have 352 reasons why it\u2019s a \u2018do-Nothing Senate.\u2019 \"352 bills are sitting on Harry Reid\u2019s desk, awaiting action. \"98 percent of them passed with bipartisan support -- Republicans and Democrats working together to pass legislation. \"50 percent of the bills passed unanimously, with no opposition. \"70 percent of the bills passed with two-thirds support in the House. \"And over 55 bills were introduced by Democrats. \"352 bills. Why won\u2019t Harry Reid act? These are good bills; bills that put the American people back to work, put more money in hardworking Americans pockets, help with education, and skills training. We call upon Harry Reid to get to work before he adjourns in August to pass some of these bills. The American people deserve better.\" Jenkins offered a lot of statistics in a short statement, so to keep this fact-check manageable, we\u2019ll focus on her claim that in the \"do-nothing Senate,\" there are 352 House bills \"sitting on Harry Reid\u2019s desk awaiting action,\" including 55 introduced by Democrats. Have 352 bills passed the House but await action in the Senate? Basically, yes. We used the THOMAS congressional database to pluck out the 733 measures that have passed the House so far this year. We then weeded out a few categories of bills -- ones that, for procedural reasons, were never intended to go to the Senate (such as election of the Speaker, assignment of lawmakers to committees, and procedural motions) or ones that were subsequently taken up by the Senate (either being passed or rejected). What remained were 342 individual bills. That\u2019s 10 fewer than what Jenkins claimed, but we have no quarrel with her number, since the difference likely stems from additional bills being passed in the couple of days between when she spoke and when we looked through the database. Are these bills \"sitting on Harry Reid\u2019s desk awaiting action\"? Resolving this claim is murkier. First, a technical problem. It\u2019s an oversimplification to say that these bills are \"sitting on Harry Reid\u2019s desk.\" Many have been assigned to committees, where they would need to be approved before being taken up on the floor. While Reid has influence over what committee chairs do, a chair can -- using their own powers -- decide to either fast-track or stall a bill coming over from the House. Another complication: In at least some cases, the Senate is working on a bill on the same topic, but without using the House bill as a starting point. \"The disposition of a House bill is not particularly relevant to measuring Senate legislative activity,\" said Steven Smith, political scientist and Senate specialist at Washington University in St. Louis. We should also note that in the Senate, one member -- either from the majority or the minority -- can stop a bill in its tracks by threatening to filibuster -- a delay that requires 60 votes to break. Reasonable people can disagree about whether Reid or Senate Republicans are the biggest offenders -- we previously addressed some of those issues -- but the experts we checked with said both parties share at least some of the blame. \"There's plenty of blame to go around,\" said Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican House aide now studying Congress at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Wolfensberger sees Reid as the bigger offender by blocking bills and amendments \"to protect his vulnerable members who are up for re-election in November. You can blame the threat of filibusters and politically sensitive amendments from Republicans, but politics ain't bean bag. Senators were sent there to cast the tough votes, not to be pampered, protected and coddled by their leaders.\" Others see Republican threats as the bigger problem. \"It is true that some bills, including some of substance, are being blocked by Reid from action because he wants to avoid Republican amendments of the \u2018gotcha\u2019 variety that could work against some of his endangered incumbents up this fall,\" said Norm Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \"You can make a case that the role of the majority is to suck it up and do votes, even if some are uncomfortable. But on the balance sheet, the bigger reality is that very few of the bills passed by the House were aimed at compromise or agreement with the Senate.\" A spokesman for Jenkins, Thomas W. Brandt, told PolitiFact, \"Only Sen. Reid can bring these bills up for a vote, and if he did, it would go a long way in ending the legislative gridlock currently plaguing Washington.\" Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Reid, countered by noting that there are 50 bipartisan Senate-passed bills awaiting House action. (Here's the list.) Do the House-passed, Senate-stalled bills include 55 introduced by Democrats? On the number, Jenkins is basically right -- we counted 54. But if this statistic is intended to communicate how generously the House treats its minority caucus, Jenkins\u2019 talking point is somewhat overblown. Unlike the Senate, where the minority party and individual lawmakers hold notable leverage, the House is structured -- regardless of which party is in power -- as a tyranny of the majority. Whoever has the most votes and holds the Speaker\u2019s gavel determines which bills get considered, and precisely how they get considered. Minority-party preferences are granted, if at all, as a favor from the majority. The number of Democratic-sponsored bills Jenkins mentions -- 55 -- accounts for just 16 percent of all House-passed bills now awaiting consideration in the Senate. But even that figure is misleadingly high. When we took a closer look at the 55 Democratic-sponsored bills that passed the House, we found that fewer than half -- 24 -- could reasonably be described as substantive. And many of these were the kinds of measures lawmakers would be hard-pressed to vote against -- for instance, the National Pediatric Research Network Act of 2013, the Homes for Heroes Act of 2013, the Traumatic Brain Injury Reauthorization Act of 2014, the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013, the Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act and the Human Trafficking Prevention Act. The remainder of the 55 Democratic-sponsored bills -- a majority -- aren\u2019t exactly the most high-profile measures pending in Congress. Thirteen were technical changes to local federal lands; five approved honorific names for postal or other buildings; four addressed federal studies or advisory committees; three were bills sponsored by a non-voting territorial delegate; three concerned narrow technical corrections to existing legislation; one concerned U.S. coinage; and one was a private bill granting an immigrant visa to an individual. So House bipartisanship lives, but let\u2019s not oversell it. Why the numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story Experts say this bill counting merits a grain of salt. As the breakdown of the 55 Democratic-sponsored bills suggests, many of the measures that pass the House -- and some that go on to pass the Senate -- are noncontroversial bills. Wolfensberger crunched the numbers for us and found that of the 570 bills and joint resolutions that have passed the House in the current Congress, 377, or 74 percent, originated as suspension bills -- a streamlined process used for non-controversial measures that requires two-thirds approval. And of the 142 measures signed into law by Obama, 118, or 83 percent, were approved by that same two-thirds requirement. Meanwhile, many of the other bills that pass the House in today\u2019s environment are bills that are intended to make a statement, not a law. Ornstein contrasted bills that are \"designed to lay the predicate for action via compromise\" or consensus, which are declining, and those \"designed for show or as a political statement, where there is neither intention nor expectation that the other house will act on them.\" Where substantive, contentious legislation is concerned, the odds of passage are poor. One example is the Senate-passed (and bipartisan) immigration bill, which remains stuck in the House. Another sign is the fact that the Senate has not yet passed any of the 12 annual appropriations bills -- even though the House has passed seven and the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved eight. By contrast, the second category of \"show\" bills includes dozens of full or partial repeals of the Affordable Care Act passed by the Republican House. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution, said a fundamental reality of today's political landscape is that \"the two chambers' majorities have different agendas and priorities and different ideas of what constitutes a 'problem.' And even when the parties agree on the need to address an issue, their prescriptions differ. That complicates the legislative process, and in the current period of high partisanship, it seems most often to bring the legislative process to a halt.\""

While it is true that some newborn babies in Colorado have tested positive for marijuana, the evidence provided does not support the claim that half of all newborns in the hospital have marijuana in their system.\n\nThe ad cited by Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy uses a single month's worth of data to make their claim, which is an unfair representation of the actual numbers.

The ad cherry-picks one month of data to make the number of newborns who test positive for marijuana seem higher than it actually is.\n\nFurthermore, the ad does not provide any context or comparison to similar hospitals or states where marijuana is not legal.

    "doc": "The last-minute contributions opposing an initiative that would legalize recreational marijuana in Arizona continue to pile up, with even Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson shelling out $500,000 against the cause. Much like the money, the ads against recreational marijuana continue to flow as well. An Oct. 11 ad from Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, an anti-pot group, uses testimonies from two former Colorado politicians in highlighting the supposed dangers of recreational marijuana. \"In one Colorado hospital, 50 percent of newborns tested had marijuana in their system,\" former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb says. This claim stood out to us right away. Could half of all newborn babies tested at this particular hospital really have marijuana in their system? Deceptive data The ad cites a September 2016 report from the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area -- an interagency group focused on combating drug trafficking. According to the report, \"nearly half\" of newborns tested in March 2016 at St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center in Pueblo, Colo., tested positive for marijuana. Ciara Archer, a spokeswoman for the anti-pot group, also pointed us to a July 2016 CBS Denver story on the hospital. The article notes that the head of the neonatal unit, Dr. Steve Simerville, is reporting a \"dramatic increase\" in newborns with marijuana in their system. We reached out to the hospital and dug into the numbers. Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, but St. Mary-Corwin spokeswoman Wendi Dammann said babies have been drug tested at the hospital for at least a decade. \"The screening criteria was developed by both local hospitals (St. Mary-Corwin and Parkview) and Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado,\" she said. As far as the numbers cited in the ad, Dammann confirmed that five out of the 11 newborn babies tested in March 2016 did test positive for marijuana. So that\u2019s less than 46 percent -- not half -- of a handful of births in one month. Cherry-picking one month of data makes the number of newborns who test positive for marijuana seem higher than it actually is. That is not the case. From January 2016 through September 2016, 403 babies were born at St. Mary-Corwin. About one-quarter of those, or 101, were tested for marijuana. Of those 101 newborns, 27 tested positive for marijuana in their systems. That\u2019s a rate slightly under 27 percent. And in 2015, the hospital saw 519 births. Of the 93 newborn babies tested for marijuana, 31 came up positive for marijuana. That\u2019s a rate of 33 percent. Marijuana use during and after pregnancy can be quite harmful. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, exposure to THC \"could have profound and long-lasting consequences\" to a baby\u2019s brain and behavior, including neurological development. We wanted to know how these statistics compared to the country or states where marijuana is not legal, but we could not find much research on that point. However, Dr. Edith Allen of Phoenix Children\u2019s Hospital, studied drug habits for pregnant women with criteria including personal or family history of drug use at St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital and Medical Center between 2006 and 2010. Her study found THC in 431 babies out of 727 mother-baby pairings tested -- almost 60 percent. However, Allen pointed out that not every pregnant woman was tested."

    "doc": "The paid medical experts of TV channels are seeing a lot of time on the airwaves lately as they diagnose the country\u2019s measles flare-up. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that they were explaining risks of the Ebola virus killing thousands of Western Africans and the chances it could spread throughout the United States. This time around, the health pundits have spent considerable time spelling out the differences between the two scary diseases. Ebola, which has a low risk of spreading through the United States, is passed through direct contact with bodily fluids and not through the air. Measles, which was eliminated from the United States in 2000 due to wide vaccination, is a very different virus, explained CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. Unlike Ebola, \"you don\u2019t need to be that close to someone or kiss someone or anything like that\" to pass it around. \"It\u2019s airborne,\" she told Anderson Cooper on Feb. 2. \"If someone is in a room that has measles and leaves and you walk in two hours later, you could get measles from that person.\" We thought her example sounded alarming. So, after checking our personal immunization histories, we decided to fact-check her statement. We didn\u2019t hear back from Cohen when we reached out to CNN, but we found information from a reliable source that backs up her scenario. Her example is nearly exactly the transmission description for measles from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The measles virus stays in the nose and throat mucus of someone who has the infection, so it makes sense that it is passed around through coughing and sneezing. \"Also, measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed,\" the CDC says. \"If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected.\" Physicians encourage the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine because it is very effective in preventing the virus from entering the body (and as we found, thescience is certainthat it is safe). The disease is so easy to catch, the CDC says, that if one person catches it, a whopping 90 percent of people who are not immune (i.e. did not have the vaccine due to a weak immune system, age or personal choice) close to the infected person will also become infected. We can compare the contagion of each disease by examining the basic reproductive number, known as the R0. This refers to the average number of secondary infection cases stemming from one infected person in a \"completely susceptible\" uninfected population (if the population is vaccinated for, say, measles, the R0 basically disappears). As the R0 increases above 1, the disease spreads more widely. The R0 of Ebola is around 2, meaning an average of two people catch the disease from one infected person during an outbreak. The measles has a much higher R0 of 18, higher than AIDS (R0 of 4), SARS (R0 of 4), or mumps (R0 of 10). NPR\u2019s Shots blog has a great chart breaking down this concept. Put another way, \"Ebola's got nothing\" on the measles epidemic, wrote Dr. Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center, in a recent Houston Chronicle opinion-editorial. \"Just being in the room where someone with measles has been 30 minutes earlier can expose you,\" Troisi wrote. Troisi confirmed the accuracy of Cohen\u2019s statement. When we asked about the discrepancy between her 30-minute window and Cohen\u2019s two-hour window, she directed us to the CDC\u2019s website and called her estimate \"conservative.\""

    "doc": "President Barack Obama this week touted the progress his administration has made in recovering from the economic recession, focusing on developments in engineering and manufacturing. \"Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people, the good news is the economy is growing stronger,\" he said in a speech on Jan. 15, 2014, at North Carolina State University. \"Our businesses have now created more than 8 million new jobs since we hit bottom. Because of an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy, for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world.\" PolitiFact wanted to know if Obama\u2019s claim gives us an accurate picture of U.S. oil numbers. A spokesman offered up this White House blog post that touches on Obama\u2019s point in more detail. Domestic crude oil production surpassed crude oil imports in October 2013 for the first time since 1995. We also consulted the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to theirNovember 2013 report, the United Statesproducedan average of 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in October andimported7.5 million barrels of oil per day. So Obama\u2019s numbers add up. How did we arrive at this point? Kenneth Medlock, an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies, said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports. \"Yes, we are producing more than we import now, but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand,\"Medlock said. The reduced demand is due in part to the recession. It\u2019s no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when there\u2019s less money in their wallets, so that lowers demand. And if demand is down, the United States doesn\u2019t need to import as much oil supply. Another cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency. Over the last few years, rising popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump, said John Lowe, a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University. Aside from reduced demand, Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than it's importing. We can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure. That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights, as well as open access to pipelines. But we can\u2019t tie these developments back to one president, Medlock said. They go back a couple of decades. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency. When he campaigned for office, he promised to reduce the country\u2019s dependency on foreign oil. In 2012, we rated that Promise Kept based on projections of the impact of his administration\u2019s fuel efficiency standards."

The information behind Barrientos\u2019 statement, he said, came from a map and research that appeared Aug. 4, 2011, on an investigative reporting website, The Austin Bulldog.Young\u2019s group spot-checked the data against city records, found it reliable and \"ran with it,\" he said. Separately, Austin city demographer Ryan Robinson told us he also found the research, compiled by Bulldog editor Ken Martin, to be reliable: \"He really did his due diligence.\"From 1971 through 2011, Young said, 55 percent of Austin\u2019s elected officials lived in four ZIP codes -- 78701, 78703, 78731 and 78759. The 10 percent population figure, he said, was derived from the 2010 Census totals for Austin and for those four ZIP codes.The Bulldog\u2019s description of its research said, \"This map indicates where every person who served on the Austin City Council from 1971 through 2011 lived at the time they were elected.\"The Bulldog report said its research started with 1971 because that was the year voters started electing the mayor. Previously, mayors were chosen by council votes.That gave a total of 17 mayors and 100 council members, according to the Bulldog analysis, which argued that Austin power has been too concentrated in select areas. \"Forty-nine of those seats were won by people who lived in West and Northwest Austin,\" the Bulldog said.We spot-checked a dozen addresses shown in the Bulldog\u2019s interactive map and found only minor discrepancies. For instance, former Council Member Brigid Shea told us by telephone that she moved from the French Place neighborhood, which has the 78722 ZIP code, to the 78701 address shown for her by the Bulldog about two years into her council term. The Bulldog website asks that readers send notice of any mistakes they spot; we make the same request.For more detail, Young pointed us to Martin, who founded the Bulldog in 2010 after journalism jobs including editor of the Austin Business Journal and past founder-owner of a City Hall news service, InFact Daily.Martin told us in a phone interview that his starting point was a similar project that city demographer Robinson worked on in the 2000s. He supplemented that information with more city records and candidate financial statements, interviews and historical materials including old Austin phonebooks, Martin said.According to his data, which he called up on his computer and crunched for us during the interview, those four ZIP codes accounted for 58 of the 117 city offices filled in Austin elections (City Council including mayor) from 1971 through 2011.That divides out to 49.6 percent, not 55 percent.We asked Young for help clarifying the discrepancy, and he sent us calculations that he said were made by a volunteer during the group\u2019s research. From that spreadsheet, it appears mayors were double-counted by adding the number of mayors to the number of \"council members,\" a category that in Martin\u2019s data already included mayors. If mayors are double-counted, our math shows a result of 54.9 percent; if the mayors are, properly, counted once, we get 49.6 percent.Young said the double-counting explanation seemed likely to him. \"You and Ken may have found out my young person, who was a college student, had made a boo-boo,\" he said. But, he said, \"58 is still half of all city elected officials that have come from these four ZIP codes in 40 years. So our basic point is still true even if our math is faulty.\"We also wondered whether the cited ZIP codes had been home to 10 percent of Austinites throughout those decades. Geographic Representation group spokeswoman Jessica Ellison said their research was limited to 2010 because they didn\u2019t have Census numbers for all 40 years.Barrientos\u2019 statement could be read as applying to the entire period, though, so we decided to check as best we could.A 2010 U.S. Census Bureau breakdown of the nation\u2019s most populous cities gave Austin\u2019s population as 790,390. So a tenth would be 79,390.Beginning in 2000, the Census Bureau has used ZIP Code Tabulation Areas rather than ZIP codes for its calculations, in order to have clearly defined boundaries that didn\u2019t move as postal delivery logistics changed. An individual ZCTA (which the Census Bureau says you should pronounce ZIK-tah) is roughly equivalent, though not identical, to its corresponding ZIP code.The 2010 counts for ZCTAs corresponding to the four ZIP codes are: 78701 population 6,841; 78703 population 19,690; 78731 population 24,614; and 78759 population 38,891.These add up to 90,036 people, or 11.4 percent of Austin\u2019s 2010 population.Robinson and Census librarian Asheleigh Perry told us the city and the Census Bureau Library don\u2019t have 1970-1990 Austin populations by ZIP code.We did find on the Census website the 2000 ZCTA counts that correspond to the 2010 numbers above. Those totals are: 78701 population 3,855; 78703 population 19,585; 78731 population 24,059; and 78759 population 1,530.That adds up to 49,029; divide by Austin\u2019s 2000 population of 656,562 and you get 7.5 percent -- an even smaller slice of the city than in 2010.Population numbers aside, Robinson told us he believed the overall point is valid: Council members \"have indeed come from a concentrated part of the city,\" he said. \"The distribution of mayors over time has been even more concentrated.\""

    "doc": "Following the release of several videos claiming to prove Planned Parenthood illegally profits off of aborted fetal tissue, many anti-abortion politicians have called for cuttingoff federal funding to the women\u2019s health organization. At the second Republican debate, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina laid out defunding Planned Parenthood as a priority. \"I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes,\" she said on the stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Sept. 16. \"Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, 'We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.' \" The videos, which amount to at least a dozen hours, are produced by the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress. They primarily show people posing as tissue brokers and talking with Planned Parenthood employees about procuring fetal tissue for medical research. Fiorina\u2019s claim makes it sound like there is actual footage of Planned Parenthood examining an aborted fetus whose heart is still beating, while someone says \"we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.\" There isn't. Fiorina is likely talking about this 10-minute Aug. 19 video. (Warning: The video contains extremely gruesome footage.) The video shows an interview with a woman talking about a scene similar to the one Fiorina describes; the video\u2019s creators have matched her interview with grisly stock footageof a fetus outside the womb. In the video, the Center for Medical Progress interviews a woman identified as Holly O\u2019Donnell, a former procurement technician for StemExpress. StemExpress is a biomedical company that previously worked with Planned Parenthood to collect tissue for medical research, but the company ended its relationship with Planned Parenthood amid the ongoing controversy. O\u2019Donnell talks about a time when she saw a fully-formed aborted fetus, with its heart still beating,in a pathology lab at a California Planned Parenthood clinic while she was on a job. \"I\u2019m sitting here looking at this fetus, and its heart is beating, and I don\u2019t know what to think,\" O\u2019Donnell said. According to O\u2019Donnell, her supervisor then told her they would procure the brain because the fetus was well-preserved. The Center for Medical Progress video does not show actually show footage of O\u2019Donnell\u2019s experience, and there\u2019s nothing else in the video to corroborate O\u2019Donnell\u2019s story. Additionally, the supervisor in O\u2019Donnell\u2019s story does not say anything about keeping the fetus alive specifically for the purpose of harvesting the brain. To dramatize O\u2019Donnell\u2019s interview, the video cuts to a fetus outside the womb, placed on what appears to be some sort of examination surface, and the fetus\u2019 legs are moving. The Center for Medical Progress says the source of thefootage is the Grantham Collection, an organization that hopes to stem abortion by promoting graphic images of the procedure. We don\u2019t know the circumstances behind this video: where it came from, under what conditions it was obtained, or even if this fetus was actually aborted (as opposed to a premature birth or miscarriage)."

    "justification": "The label \"False\" is appropriate for the claim that \"A North Carolina study proves that 'probably over a million people voted twice in (the 2012) election.'\" The evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim. Firstly, the report from the North Carolina Board of Elections found 765 voters who matched on each category with someone who voted elsewhere during the 2012 general election, which is a small number compared to the claim of \"over a million people.\" Additionally, the larger group based on name and birth date had a proportion that was likely to be abused, but the scale of the problem was overstated. The Interstate Crosscheck program itself showed how quickly the scale can drop from massive to minuscule. Furthermore, the article highlighted that basic statistics make it even tougher to say this process picks out the same person in two states. The author also noted that outside of the Interstate Crosscheck system, the number of people who vote twice seems low. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, the claim is false.",
    "doc": "The pursuit of voter fraud is a running theme among Republicans and the latest numbers out of North Carolina made the conservative websites pop with alarming headlines. \"Oh My: Audit Finds Evidence of Widespread Voter Fraud in North Carolina,\" wrote Townhall.com. The National Review had \"N.C. State Board Finds More than 35K Incidents of \u2018Double Voting\u2019 in 2012.\" The North Carolina news certainly fired up Dick Morris, a Fox News commentator and former political adviser to President Bill Clinton (who has largely turned against the Clintons these days). \"It's most important data I've read in a year,\" Morris said on Fox News\u2019 Hannity. \"The elections commissioner there, Kim Strach, did a study of those who voted in North Carolina who also voted in another state in 2012 and she found 35,500 people voted in North Carolina and voted in some other state. \"And only 27 states pool that data. Texas, California, New York and Florida did not pool their data. So you're talking about probably over a million people that voted twice in this election. This is the first concrete evidence we've ever had of massive voter fraud. We\u2019ve talked about it ad nauseam. This proves it.\" Morris amplified on this claim in an op-ed that came out two days later. For this fact-check, we examine whether the report from the North Carolina Board of Elections proves that probably a million people voted twice in 2012. Let\u2019s begin with the report, which wasn\u2019t so much a report as one small piece of a longer slide show for lawmakers sitting on the state\u2019s Elections Oversight Committee (see slides 34 and 35 in the presentation). Strach, executive director of the State Board of Elections, was giving the initial results from the state\u2019s participation in a project run by the Kansas Secretary of State\u2019s Office, Interstate Crosscheck. That project has grown from four states in 2005 to 28 in 2013. The list includes Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Those states send voter information to Kansas where the record of each of their voters is run against the records in all the other participating states. They are matched on first name, last name, date of birth and Social Security number. According to the Associated Press, Strach reported that this produced 765 voters in North Carolina who matched on each category with someone who voted elsewhere during the 2012 general election. \"Could it be voter fraud? Sure, it could be voter fraud,\" Strach told lawmakers. \"Could it be an error on the part of a precinct person choosing the wrong person's name in the first place? It could be. We're looking at each of these individual cases.\" Stracht said an additional 35,570 North Carolina voters matched on first and last name and date of birth, but not Social Security number. She emphasized the need for more investigation. Hans von Spakovsky, a former member of the Federal Election Commission who is a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that 765 voters matched down to the last four digits of a Social Security number suggests that North Carolina has the goods. \"It is highly unlikely with all of these matching, that these were different individuals,\" Spakovsky said. Spakovsky said the larger group, based on name and birth date, was also fruitful ground to root out abuse. \"It is probable that many of these are the same individuals, but there is also going to be certain percentage of folks who may share the same name and birthdate but are not the same individual. What that proportion will be I don\u2019t know \u2013 but they all need to be investigated,\" he said. These numbers are large. In fact, Spakovsky said that in itself is part of the problem. It takes an enormous effort to get to the bottom of each case and election officials rarely have the resources. However, if the past is any guide, there is reason to doubt that the problem of double voting and voting fraud is as large as these figures suggest. The track record of the Interstate Crosscheck program itself shows how quickly the scale can drop from massive to miniscule. Kansas created the project nearly a decade ago, which is enough time to assess its performance. In a September 2013 presentation, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said more than 84 million records had been fed into his office\u2019s database. At that time, 22 states were in the pool. Kansas found over 120,000 potential duplicate voters based on first and last name and date of birth. The emphasis is on potential. Kobach\u2019s presentation included the number of cases referred for prosecution. The total was 14. All of the referrals dated back to at least 2010. That year, over 850,000 people voted. There is no indication that any convictions emerged. That might be due to the workload and priorities of prosecutors but the point remains the same: The Interstate Crosscheck process starts very big and ends very small. Kobach also noted that four people were indicted in Colorado on charges of having also voted in Arizona. While an indictment is more serious than a referral, again, it is not a conviction. We reached out to the Kansas Secretary of State\u2019s Office but the staff did not respond before our deadline. We will update this article if we learn anything new. The question is, why do the numbers drop off so radically? Michael McDonald, a political scientist at George Mason University, says there are many reasons. In his research, McDonald has spent a lot of time with voting records. They are not tidy. \"You find missing data, or worse, a missing data code,\" McDonald explained. \"They might plug in \u20189999\u2019 when they don\u2019t have a Social Security number and people are getting matched on that missing data code.\" In particular, clerical errors make voting records highly unreliable, McDonald said. \"Someone might mark that a person voted when they didn\u2019t, or they confuse fathers and sons who have the same name,\" he said. Interestingly, the Interstate Crosscheck staff acknowledge this. In their 2014 participation guide for states, they warn that \"a significant number of apparent double votes are false positives and not double votes. Many are the result of errors -- voters sign the wrong line in the poll book, election clerks scan the wrong line with a barcode scanner.\" PunditFact looked at how North Carolina keeps its records. A bit over half of the counties, 53 of them, use a manual entry paper poll book. Mistakes are simply part of record keeping. In a different arena, medical records, one review found that at least 23 percent of names were misspelled. If database systems and human error aren\u2019t enough to explain the huge number of matches, basic statistics make it even tougher to say this process picks out the same person in two states. McDonald co-authored a 2007 article that ran the numbers on New Jersey\u2019s 2004 voter registry. More than 3.5 million people were listed as having voted that year. There was an allegation that over 4,000 people had voted twice. After scrubbing the list of 4,000 for clerical errors, about 800 matches remained. But statistically, researchers calculated that you would expect about 400 people out of the original 3.5 million to have the same names and birth dates. \"The bigger the number of people, the more likely you will find these sorts of matches,\" McDonald said. \"But they aren\u2019t the same person.\" The latest round of the Interstate Crosscheck involved over 100 million records. Outside of the Interstate Crosscheck system, the number of people who vote twice seems low. PolitiFact Texas found that of 616 allegations of voting violations over 10 years in Texas, one conviction emerged for double-voting. So we know it\u2019s unlikely that 35,000-or-more North Carolinians voted twice in 2012. How did Morris stretch it all the way to 1 million? In his op-ed, he offers some basic, but incorrect, math. The population of North Carolina is around 9.7 million, or about 3 percent of the overall U.S. population. If 35,000-or-more people voted twice in North Carolina, and if that trend continued all over the country, that would mean about 1.1 million people will have voted twice across the country, Morris figures. The problem with that calculation, however, is that if the same person votes once in North Carolina and once in Kansas, they will appear as having wrongly voted in both Kansas and North Carolina (2 hits in Morris\u2019 calculation) -- but it would actually only be one offense. Morris seems to recognize this mistake. In his op-ed, he shifted to talking about \"double-votes\". So not only is the point Morris made on television flawed, his math appears to be inflated by 100 percent."

In January 2015, Flint's average water bill was $910 per year, while Burlington's was $321 per year.

    "doc": "Sen. Bernie Sanders said during a Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., that government officials have added insult to injury by charging citizens astronomical utility rates for lead-tainted water. An audience member who lives in Flint asked both Sanders and Democratic primary opponent Hillary Clinton what they would do to help Flint\u2019s residents regain their trust in government. Sanders called the state response \"a disgrace beyond belief\" and said that if he were president, the federal government would take over when a state is incapable of resolving such a crisis. The first place he would start is with dealing with the high price of water. \"What is absolutely incredible to me is that water rates have soared in Flint,\" Sanders said on March 6, 2016. \"You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vt., for clean water.\" HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRAFACT-CHECKER With all the problems with Flint\u2019s water supply, we wondered if it was accurate that Burlington pays one-third the price for service. We learned Flint did indeed have exorbitantly high rates for water that was poisoned with lead, but the numbers have recently dropped from the level Sanders is citing. Rate debate The water crisis emerged after Gov. Rick Snyder appointed an emergency manager to oversee policy decisions in Flint, a majority African-American city ravaged by poverty following a drastic decline in the manufacturing industry. With the power to overrule local officials, then-emergency manager Michael Brown enacted a 35 percent water rate increase to shore up utilities in 2012 (remember this, because we\u2019re coming back to it). Officials opted in April 2013 to stop getting water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and join a new pipeline project called the Karegnondi Water Authority. But the pipeline to bring water from Lake Huron wasn\u2019t finished. While the infrastructure was being built, the city began drawing water from the Flint River in April 2014. At this point, it was already apparent water was exceptionally expensive in Flint. In June 2014, the Flint Journal reported that the city charged $35 more per month for water and sewer service than the next-highest rates in Genesee County. The Flint River\u2019s corrosive water leached lead from pipes into the city\u2019s supply. After months of complaints from residents, the national media started exposing the issue in the second half of 2015. (You can read a detailed review in our story here.) We didn\u2019t hear back from the Sanders campaign about his statement. But at least one source has said Flint had the highest residential water rates in the country. Food & Water Watch, an environmental nonprofit that advocates for public utility ownership, surveyed average annual water rates for the 500 largest systems in the United States. They found that in January 2015, Flint\u2019s average water bill was $910 per year. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t include Burlington (population 42,000), but we can still compare it to Flint\u2019s 100,000 or so residents by looking at the two city\u2019s water rates. If you\u2019ve ever read your own water bill, you know sussing out how you get charged is a little perplexing. But all you really need to know is that Food & Water Watch came up with their total by measuring the cost of the average household\u2019s annual drinking water use, which is about 60,000 gallons per year. That translates to about 8,021 cubic feet, and utilities often use cubic feet to set their rates. Food & Water Watch also included meter charges that utilities may bill their customers. Flint customers were charged at least $22.90 for a typical home meter, but Burlington Public Works doesn\u2019t charge a meter fee. Both cities\u2019 water departments confirmed the rates we\u2019re using. Just to further complicate things: Do you remember that 35 percent emergency rate increase from 2012? A judge ruled in August 2015 that the increase had to be rolled back because the city misused $15.7 million in water funds to settle a lawsuit. The city also must repay those millions. Because of the relatively recent change, we decided to compare Burlington and Flint both before the judge\u2019s ruling and after: City Residential rate per 100 cubic feet Water meter charge Average annual bill for 8,021 cubic feet Flint, January 2015 $7.92 $22.90 $910 Flint, after August 2015 ruling $6.19 $17.88 $770 Burlington $4.00 $0 $321 Flint\u2019s residential water rates used to essentially be twice Burlington\u2019s at the start of 2015, but were about 55 percent higher after the judge ruled the rates rolled back. Neither one of those figures is three times as much as Burlington, like Sanders said. But that hefty meter fee makes a big difference. We\u2019re including it because you had to pay it if your house in Flint had water service, raising your bill significantly. When we look at average annual bills from January 2015, Sanders\u2019 3-to-1 comparison is pretty close. But after August, Flint customers were paying a little more than twice as much as Burlington residents."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label the claim \"The United States has not completed a 'top-to-bottom review of our criminal justice system at the national level since 1965\" as True. The article text provides several pieces of evidence that support this claim:\n\nFirstly, Senator John Cornyn's statement during a call with Texas reporters on June 11 confirms that there has not been a federal review of the criminal justice system at the national level since 1965. This statement is backed up by the fact that President Donald Trump directed the formation of a commission through an executive order last year, sidestepping the need for legislative action.\n\nSecondly, the article highlights the existence of a standalone bill that would have created a commission to study ways to reduce crime and improve policing across the country. This bill was introduced before Trump created the commission, but it is still significant because it shows that there has been an ongoing effort to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the criminal justice system at the national level.\n\nThirdly, the article mentions that similar commissions have been established in the past, such as the Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice created by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. This commission came at a time when there was a need to address the country's crime problem, and it resulted in over 200 recommendations, many of which are still well-known today.\n\nFinally, the article quotes Marc Levin, founder and chief of policy and innovation at the conservative criminal justice initiative Right on Crime, who confirms that no such commission has been formed since Johnson's in 1965. This suggests that there has been a lack of comprehensive reviews of the criminal justice system at the national level in recent years.\n\nBased on these pieces of evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim \"The United States has not completed a 'top-to-bottom review of our criminal justice system at the national level since 1965\" is true.",
    "doc": "U.S. Sen. John Cornyn said the federal government has not convened a commission to review the country\u2019s criminal justice system and recommend large-scale improvements in decades. During a call with Texas reporters on June 11, Cornyn touted a part of Senate Republicans\u2019 police reform bill that would set guidelines for such a commission. \"We haven\u2019t done this top-to-bottom review of our criminal justice system at the national level since 1965,\" he told reporters. Democrats later blocked the JUSTICE Act bill, saying it didn\u2019t go far enough. We wanted to know: Has it truly been more than half a century since the American criminal justice system has undergone a federal review? Trump\u2019s commission Cornyn and other Republican lawmakers have pushed to create a commission to study ways to reduce crime and improve policing across the country, filing unsuccessful legislation to establish such a commission since at least 2010. But last year, President Donald Trump directed the formation of a commission through an executive order, sidestepping the need for legislative action. In January, U.S. Attorney General William Barr announced the creation of the Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice. The part of the wide-ranging bill Cornyn highlighted during his conversation with reporters had been lifted from a standalone bill that covered just the creation of the commission. That bill was introduced before Trump created the commission, but a spokesman for Cornyn said the senator would still like to see it advance because he believes his version is more holistic. While the President\u2019s Commission is made up of law enforcement officials only, Cornyn\u2019s would include community leaders, civil rights advocates, crime victims, social services providers and public health officials. Cornyn\u2019s bill would also task the commission with a broader area for review, covering the criminal justice system as a whole and its effect on various areas of government from health care to education. The current commission is limited to law enforcement and crime control issues within the Department of Justice\u2019s jurisdiction because of the way it is set up. Additionally, similar to the 9/11 Commission, the bill calls for a group that would be making recommendations directly to Congress. The current commission, in 18 months, will report its findings to the Attorney General, who will submit a final report to the President. Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen, during his introductory remarks at the opening ceremony for the commission in January, echoed Cornyn\u2019s statement and said \"it has been over 50 years since we have systematically studied ways\" to improve upon the criminal justice system. Earlier commissions Drew Brandewie, a spokesman for Cornyn, said Cornyn was referring to the Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice that President Lyndon B. Johnson created in 1965. The commission ended up coming up with more than 200 recommendations -- many of them now very well-known mainstays, such as the 911 emergency call system and research organizations like the Bureau of Justice Statistics. It, too, was established by way of executive order. Johnson signed the order July 23, 1965, according to The American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. In the 1965 commission\u2019s final report, members wrote that Johnson had created the group \"recognizing the urgency of the Nation's crime problem and the depth of ignorance about it.\" The report stated that Johnson wanted to address a key issue with the criminal justice system: a lack of data on police, courts and other justice agencies, which made it difficult to make basic assessments of crime on a national level. Prior to Johnson\u2019s commission, the last effort that was similar in scope was established under President Herbert Hoover to examine the enforcement of alcohol prohibition and its impact on other criminal elements, according to a 1931 report produced by Hoover\u2019s commission. Johnson\u2019s commission came as race riots were breaking out in major U.S. cities over police brutality and other frustrations, including the well-known Los Angeles Watts Riots. \"The commission in 1965 really stemmed from the upheaval in the country at the time, and from everything I\u2019ve read, Barry Goldwater, he made \u2018law and order\u2019 a big issue during the campaign,\" said Marc Levin, founder and chief of policy and innovation at the conservative criminal justice initiative Right on Crime. \"And when LBJ came in, he really felt that we needed to take a look at this.\" Levin agreed that no such commission has been formed since Johnson\u2019s. He said other groups have met and provided recommendations in the years since, but none were as robust as that of a national commission. In 2014, for example, Congress created the Charles Colson Task Force on Federal Corrections, which made recommendations on how to make the prison system more just and efficient. But that only looked at the Bureau of Prisons and not the entire criminal justice system from police to courts. \"I think (Cornyn\u2019s) statement is very accurate,\" he said."

    "doc": "Austin school librarian Sara Stevenson says state-mandated testing occurs too often.\"The Austin school district calendar lists 64 different dates for either a state-mandated test or make-up test,\" Stevenson wrote in an opinion column posted by the Austin American-Statesman on April 4, 2012.A third of the 180-day school year marked for state-ordered tests or make-ups?After we asked Stevenson how she reached her count, she said in a telephone interview that she mistakenly counted every test, re-test or make-up on the testing calendar as a separate date when that\u2019s not what the calendar shows.\"I should have said (64) different tests rather than different test dates,\" she said.Still, there\u2019s a lot of testing, she said.Stevenson was referring to dates set aside for one of two state-mandated tests behind the state\u2019s long-established mandate that students pass such tests to advance from grade to grade and, ultimately, qualify for a high-school diploma. One exam, the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills, started getting phased out in 2011-12 with the more rigorous State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness taking its place in most grades.By our count, the Austin district\u2019s calendar shows 34 dates set aside for state-mandated tests or make-up tests from mid-October 2011 through mid-July 2012 when the district has scheduled re-tests for different versions of the TAKS and STAAR.Mark Billingsley, the district director of systemwide testing, cautioned in a telephone interview against concluding that every student is taking a state-ordered test on 34 different days -- or even any number of days close to that. He said that high-school students, faced with the exit-level TAKS plus end-of-course subject-matter tests, are taking the most state tests.From Oct. 18, 2011, through July 12, 2012, the calendar lists more than 60 different tests or make-up/re-test opportunities. In March 2012, for instance, the calendar shows 14 possible tests, re-tests or make-ups on nine different dates. Students in some grades could re-take the Mathematics and Science TAKS. Other tests on the month\u2019s calendar include grade-specific STAARs in English, writing, math and reading.Separately, district spokeswoman Helena Wright pointed out that the state-related testing dates are dictated by the Texas Education Agency, which posts annual student assessment testing calendars. Indeed, the state agency\u2019s 2011-12 state calendar shows almost all the same testing dates as the Austin district\u2019s calendar.TEA spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe confirmed that every Texas district must give the state tests on the same dates, though she said in a telephone interview that a district may seek permission to test on a different date after, say, a hurricane or other momentous event.Ratcliffe said the number of testing dates in Texas schools has increased over the years in response to state and federal mandates. But, she said, \"any one kid is only going to spend two to five days a year taking the state tests\" unless he or she fails, in which case re-testing would be possible.She pointed us to an agency chart, dated March 3, 2011, showing that for the STAAR, the total mandatory testing days in 2011-12 are varying by grade. For third- and sixth-graders, the number is two days. It\u2019s three days for fifth graders, four days in grades 4, 7 and 8 and five days in grades 9, 10 and 11.Ratcliffe pointed out another potentially relevant aspect. \"This perception that there\u2019s an excessive amount of testing comes not just from the state tests,\" Ratcliffe said, but also from practice testing that districts undertake to prepare students for the TAKS and STAAR.More testing dates? We were curious.To our inquiry, the Austin district shared its 2011-12 schedules for district-level \"benchmark\" assessments. With the exception of brief reading tests given in Kindergarten through second grade, the benchmark tests are not state required.But they do take up some time, occurring 12 and 25 weeks into the year and at year\u2019s end so teachers learn how well students have absorbed what they have been taught in line with the state\u2019s curriculum, Debra Ready, the district\u2019s executive director of assessment and accountability, told us in a telephone interview. She said, though, that it would be inaccurate to say that the bulk of each test date gets taken up by the tests, which average just 30 to 41 questions each.The benchmark test schedules indicate that the number of days during which up to two hours would be spent taking the benchmark tests varies by grade, ranging from four days or so for third graders, for instance, to as many as nine days for eighth graders, it appears.Finally, we did not determine how many, if any, days that Austin schools devote to practice runs of the TAKS and STAAR. By email, district spokeswoman Erin Moore said the district administration does not develop practice versions of those exams. \"However,\" Moore said, \"some campuses may use state-released (test) items to help students feel comfortable before testing begins. This may be done on a campus by campus basis. We do not track this practice.\"Upshot: At Stevenson's request, the Statesman published a correction specifying that the district calendar shows 64 different state-mandated tests, not testing dates."

The estimate of $1.9 billion is based on an assumption that there are people who currently qualify for Medicaid but have not enrolled, and that they would come forward under the new system. However, the state's own Agency for Health Care Administration found that this assumption is overstated, as many of these individuals may already be eligible for Medicaid through other programs.\n2. The estimate also assumes that people who are currently purchasing private insurance would abandon their plans and enroll in Medicaid under the expansion. However, the agency's report found that this assumption is also overstated, as many of these individuals may prefer to keep their private insurance or cannot afford Medicaid premiums.\n3. The state estimates the number of people who would be eligible for the Medicaid expansion and apply, but this estimate is based on a rough calculation and may not accurately reflect the actual number of people who would enroll.\n4. The state's most generous estimate is that the Medicaid changes as part of the federal health care law will cost the state about $1.47 billion a year starting in 2020. However, this estimate includes costs for increased rates for Medicaid primary care physicians, which are not directly related to the Medicaid expansion.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the estimate of $1.9 billion in costs for the Medicaid expansion in Florida is overstated and cannot be supported by the evidence provided. Therefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "Gov. Rick Scott announced June 29, 2012, that Florida will not expand its Medicaid program, saying that provision of the federal health care law would cost the state an additional $1.9 billion a year.\"It\u2019s going to cost Florida $1.9 billion a year,\" Scott said July 2, 2012, while co-hosting CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box. Scott repeated the $1.9 billion claim on Fox News June 29 and July 2, on CNN July 1 and in a July 1 official statement.Don\u2019t believe it.Scott\u2019s Medicaid figure is an oversimplified estimate that relies on several assumptions and ignores how the Medicaid expansion would actually be implemented. Even if you believe the assumptions and ignore how the law would be implemented, Scott is still quoting the wrong number, according to an estimate created by his own Agency for Health Care Administration.By now, you\u2019ve probably read about the proposed Medicaid expansion, which was part of the 2010 federal health care law. But you\u2019ve also likely missed some critical details in the few paragraphs of background you\u2019ve seen.Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government-run health care program for the very poor. (Its cousin, Medicare, is for senior citizens of any income level.) Medicaid is an entirely voluntary program for the states -- but every state participates -- in part because of the good financial terms. The federal government covers about 55 percent of all Medicaid costs in Florida and covered about 68 percent in recent years with additional stimulus funding.The health care law required states to expand eligibility to Medicaid by raising income eligibility limits to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. States currently have widely varying thresholds depending on a person\u2019s age and situation, and Florida has some of the strictest thresholds in the country. For instance, childless adults cannot receive Medicaid in Florida, and parents who have children must make less than 22 percent of the federal poverty level to receive Medicaid. (That means a single parent of one would have to make less than about $3,500 a year to qualify for Medicaid in Florida.)The federal government agreed to fund 100 percent of the cost for states to expand Medicaid for three budget years. The federal government would cover 95 percent of the costs in 2017, 94 percent of the costs in 2018, 93 percent of the costs in 2019 and 90 percent of the costs in 2020 and beyond.The expansion, too, was technically voluntary, but the federal government said it would penalize any state (by withholding Medicaid funds) that failed to comply. That penalty was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 28, 2012.The court\u2019s ruling allows states like Florida to decline expansion without losing any current funding.That brings us back to Scott.His own Agency for Health Care Administration attempted to quantify the financial impact to the state because of the changes to Medicaid (which is quite different than the expansion of Medicaid Scott is talking about). We received a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation of the agency\u2019s findings, dated Jan. 4, 2012.The state first assumed that there are people who currently qualify for Medicaid, pre-expansion, but have not enrolled for one reason or another. They would come forward, however, in the new system. The cost to Florida: $516 million a year.The state also figured that there are people currently privately purchasing insurance who would abandon their private plans because they would be eligible for Medicaid as part of the expansion. That would cost Florida another $90 million a year.And of course the state estimated the number of people who would be eligible for the Medicaid expansion and would apply. The cost: $500 million.Most of these costs, mind you, would not kick in until 2020 -- a fact Scott ignores.That said, the state estimates the Medicaid expansion -- which the state says would provide health insurance for an additional 2 million Floridians -- would cost about $1 billion a year starting in 2020.More than half of that cost, however, would come from people who today are eligible for Medicaid but have not yet enrolled. That cost could come whether or not Florida agrees to participate in the Medicaid expansion.The state health care agency lumps in another $400 million in costs each year for increased rates for Medicaid primary care physicians in its report. But we\u2019re not sure why.The rate increase was part of the federal health care law -- not the Medicaid expansion -- as a way to make reimbursement rates the same for Medicare and Medicaid patients. But the rate increase was only temporary for 2013 and 2014, and was fully funded by the federal government. Florida could decide to continue paying higher reimbursement rates, but it is not required to.So the state\u2019s most generous estimate is that the Medicaid changes as part of the federal health care law will cost the state about $1.47 billion a year starting in 2020. But really, the expansion to Medicaid -- the part Scott is fighting -- would cost the state about a little more than $500 million once it\u2019s fully implemented in 2020, according to the state. (We should note that a Tallahassee group called the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy has criticized the state estimates, saying its figures are \"hyper-inflated.\" We're not taking a side on the estimates as a whole as it pertains to this fact-check.)The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation put the additional cost to the state between $1.2 billion and $2.5 billion between 2014 and 2019, which is roughly between $200 million and $400 million a year. That would help insure between 950,000 and 1.3 million Floridians. (Kaiser did not calculate a cost to the state in 2020, when Florida would pay for 10 percent of the expansion.)"

Therefore, the label False is appropriate for Rep. King's claim.",
    "doc": "There\u2019s considerable debate in Washington whether the Islamic State, the terrorist group now occupying parts of Iraq and Syria, presents a direct threat to the homeland. But to Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., there\u2019s little doubt the threat is real. Why? Because, he said, they\u2019ve tried to attack the United States before. \"They're coming at us, and we have to be on our guard at all times,\" King said Sept. 21 on Fox News Sunday. \"If (the Islamic State) went into Australia, they could certainly come into the U.S. In 2011, they attempted to attack Fort Knox.\" An attack on Fort Knox? That claim caught us by surprise. Maybe it shouldn\u2019t have, though, because it\u2019s not even the the first time King has said it. We found at least seven instances of King making similar comments \u2014 including more than a year ago \u2014 in multiple variations. Aug. 31 on CBS: \"I believe strongly that ISIS does plan on attacking the United States. Even three years ago their predecessor organization attempted to attack Fort Knox, and two people were arrested and convicted in Kentucky for that attempted attack.\" July 10 on Fox: \"In fact, three years ago when they called themselves al-Qaida in Iraq, there were three of them, three members were arrested attempting to attack Fort Knox in Kentucky.\" July 31, 2013, on CNN: \"It was a (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act)-related program that uncovered an al-Qaida cell in Sen.Paul's own state of Kentucky, which apparently was going to attack either Fort Campbell or Fort Knox.\" Is it two people or three? Was the plot against Fort Campbell or Fort Knox? No matter how many times he repeats it or how he says it, there\u2019s no public evidence that it\u2019s accurate. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, does not list an attempted attack on Fort Knox (or Fort Campbell, for that matter) on its extensive list of 60 terrorist plots in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001. Similarly, researchers at the University of Maryland National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism went through their database of foiled terrorist attacks for PolitiFact and told us\"nothing came up.\" Iraqi nationals in Kentucky King\u2019s office did not respond to multiple calls and emails over several days asking for more information. Nonetheless, based on his various comments, we were able to discern that King was referencing the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi nationals in western Kentucky on federal terrorism charges. The details of the case are indeed alarming. In September 2009, the FBI, based on a tip, launched an investigation into Waad Ramadan Alwan, an Iraqi nationalist living in Bowling Green, Ky. A confidential source for the FBI started talking with Alwan in 2011. Alwan discussed how he previously worked as a bombmaker in Iraq. He boasted about blowing up American Hummers and targeting U.S. soldiers, claiming he used improvised explosive devices, referred to by the military as IEDs, hundreds of times, according to court documents. The FBI even matched a fingerprint from Alwan to an unexploded IED that was discovered by the military in 2005. (If you can believe it, there\u2019s a warehouse outside of Washington that houses thousands of bombs found by the military). Through that, investigators were able to determine that Alwan likely killed U.S. troops while in Iraq. The confidential source continued to meet with Alwan and recruited him to assist in an operation in the United States to send explosives, firearms and money to al-Qaida of Iraq. Let\u2019s stop here for a second. It is reasonable to consider al-Qaida of Iraq a predecessor of the Islamic State, said Gary Ackerman, director of the Unconventional Weapons and Technology Division of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. What is now the Islamic State is rooted in the Iraqi branch of al-Qaida after multiple name changes and fusions with other groups. \"The core ideology and leadership have remained the same, with the strategy evolving from expelling the U.S. from Iraq and sectarian warfare in Iraq, to include toppling (Syrian President Bashar al) Assad, and eventually forming a Caliphate,\" Ackerman said. The sting On five occasions, Alwan helped procure and load money and weapons he believed were going to help al-Qaida of Iraq fight U.S. troops. In January 2011, Alwan recruited a friend to assist him \u2014 Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, another Iraqi who had moved to Bowling Green after first livingin Las Vegas. (Alwan and Hammadi entered the United States as refugees after lying about their past terrorism ties on paperwork.) From January to May 2011, the two worked together on five missions to send grenade launchers, machine guns, explosives, sniper rifles, hand grenades, missile launchers and $565,000 to al-Qaida of Iraq. Of course, this was all a sting operation. While Alwan and Hammadi thought they were helping insurgents in Iraq, in reality, the FBI was monitoring all of their actions. The weapons, which the FBI rendered unusable, were merely transferred from one location under FBI control to another. In May 2011, Alwan and Hammadi were arrested. In December 2011, Alwan pleaded guilty to a 23-count indictment, including conspiring to kill U.S. nationals abroad and multiple charges of weapons and terrorist activities. Hammadi pleaded guilty to a 12-count indictment, including attempting to provide material support to terrorists. For cooperating with authorities, Alwan received a reduced sentence of 40 years in prison followed by a lifetime under house arrest. Hammadi was sentenced to life in prison. The charges None of the charges filed against Alwan and Hammadi were for domestic terrorism plots. There is no mention of a plot against Fort Knox in their charging documents or in the affidavit of their activities from investigators submitted at trial. They were not convicted of any crimes related to domestic terrorism. All of the charges against these individuals were for actions committed while in Iraq or for trying to assist terrorist groups operating overseas. We combed through hundreds of pages of court documents available online. The only conceivable reference to any other terrorist activity is in Hammadi\u2019s sentence appeal. There, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit wrote: \"Hammadi and Alwan also plotted to murder a U.S. Army Captain whom they knew from Iraq.\" An ABC investigative report had slightly more details: \"Alwan had been caught on an FBI surveillance tape talking about using a bomb to assassinate an Army captain they'd known in Bayji, who was now back home \u2014 and to possibly attack other homeland targets.\" It\u2019s possible this captain was located at Fort Knox, which was about 90 miles from Bowling Green (for what it\u2019s worth, Fort Campbell is about 70 miles away). Perhaps King, who sits on the House intelligence committee, knows more details about this. However, even in the most generous interpretation of the facts, King\u2019s account is still radically misleading. For starters, his comments inferred (and, in fact, he has said as much in the past) that the individuals were arrested for attempting to attack Fort Knox. Again, nothing in the charging documents goes so far as to even mention a domestic plot. Second, while it\u2019s fair to say Alwan and Hammadi thought they were helping a predecessor of the Islamic State, al-Qaida of Iraq had no communication with them. Even if Alwan and Hammadi had discussed a domestic attack, it would not be accurate to say the plan came from the Islamic State or al-Qaida of Iraq. They would have been acting alone, without any approval from an actual terrorist organization. This was more or less two Iraqis with dangerous background who were duped by the FBI into believing they were helping Islamic insurgents fight Americans overseas."

    "doc": "President Barack Obama isn\u2019t just late to the party for Florida\u2019s ports, Republicans say. He\u2019s taking credit for throwing it. The Republican Party of Florida, umm, \"welcomed\" Obama to the Jacksonville Port Authority on Thursday with a full-page ad in the Florida Times-Union talking up Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s focus on the economy, especially the ports. \"Here in Jacksonville, right where you will be speaking, Gov. Scott invested $38 million in the Port of Jacksonville's vital Mile Point Project,\" the ad stated. \"It is a state investment that will help create good-paying jobs. And it covered missing federal funds for the project.\" Their attack is riddled with political irony: Obama and Scott have had major differences over transportation projects in the past (see high-speed rail), but both are fans of ports. We wanted to know if it was true that the state provided missing funds for ports that the federal government didn\u2019t. The Mile Point project is aimed at improving access to the Jacksonville port. Right now, strong ocean cross-currents prevent the biggest cargo ships from accessing the harbor outside of a narrow window each day at high tide. \"Two-thirds of the day, that cargo cannot move,\" said JaxPort spokeswoman Nancy Rubin. \"Those are just the very largest ships, but that is becoming a significant part of the trade we\u2019re dealing with.\" To fix the problem, the federal Army Corps of Engineers devised a plan that will basically remove part of a man-made wall contributing to the strong currents and reconstruct the surrounding area. By law, Congress must authorize the corps to do the project. In a gridlocked, sequester-ridden, earmark-less era, that\u2019s no easy task. Large-scale infrastructure projects have fallen prey to an earmark ban, even though its intention was to weed out spending on unvetted, wasteful projects, said Kurt Nagle, president and CEO of the American Association of Port Authorities. \"What got caught up in that were port projects that do have a clear federal role and clear national interest and have gone through multiple layers of review and analysis,\" he said. Congress typically approved money and permission for port projects in the Water Resources Development Act, which has not passed since 2007. In May, the Senate passed a bipartisan version of the bill that would authorize Mile Point and other projects, as well as allow for the corps to proceed with projects, under certain conditions, for which it has outside funding. (Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., voted for it; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., voted against.) Obama called on the House to pick up the Senate bill. Catch that? The Mile Point project is essentially held up by the House, led by Republicans averse to new spending, growing the deficit and tax cuts. The corps projected the cost for the Mile Point project at about $36 million, with 65 percent coming from the feds and the rest coming from local sources. Scott, eyeing a state budget surplus with no federal investment in the pipe anytime soon, pushed the Legislature to set aside $36 million for the project. The Legislature agreed. The port kicked in $500,000 and the federal Army Corps of Engineers kicked in $1.5 million to create designs for the project. (The ad credits all of that money to Scott, which isn't quite right.) But even though the port has the money from the state, it can\u2019t spend it because Congress hasn\u2019t moved legislation that would allow that. The state\u2019s JaxPort investment is part of a trend under Scott not to wait for federal dollars. In 2011, he got $77 million for a deep dredging project in Miami. JaxPort also wants to deepen its channel, but the Mile Point project is a ready-to-go priority (and hundreds of millions of dollars cheaper). \"We feel like we are at the finish line, we\u2019ve got the money,\" Rubin said. \"The authorization, to us, is pushing us over the finish line.\" Port of Tampa CEO and director Paul Anderson penned a June op-ed advocating for passage of the federal legislation. The Port of Tampa received about $25 million for various projects from the state in the 2013-14 budget."

In a folksy new ad in the Kentucky Senate race, Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes shares the screen with Don Disney, a retired Kentucky coalminer, who has a question for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Grimes\u2019 Republican opponent. \"I want to know how you could have voted to raise my Medicare costs by $6,000,\" says Don Disney. \"How are my wife and I supposed to afford that?\" A long silence ensues as Grimes and Disney stare at the camera. \"I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to answer that,\" Grimes offers. \"I approve this message because I\u2019ll work to strengthen Medicare, not bankrupt seniors like Don.\" Medicare became a contentious talking point in 2011, when Rep. Paul Ryan unveiled a budget proposal that Democrats said would \"end Medicare.\" We named that our Lie of the Year. Does Grimes\u2019 claim fair any better? We decided to hop in the wayback machine to find out. Where does the $6,000 figure come from? According to the Grimes campaign, the $6,000 number comes from several studies on the effect of the Ryan budget on retirees. The Ryan budget has had several incarnations over the years. This ad focuses on his 2011 proposal, according to supporting material we got from the Grimes campaign. Under the 2011 Ryan plan, Medicare would have undergone a drastic change for future retirees. Instead of the government paying doctors and hospitals for services they provide for seniors, beneficiaries would be given a voucher they could use to purchase private health insurance to cover their care. Here\u2019s our first hurdle: Did McConnell vote for the Ryan budget? Yes, but there are two important points. First, McConnell voted for a motion to proceed on the Ryan budget, which would have allowed it to the floor for further debate and amendments. It was not a vote on final passage. It was a preliminary vote that even the Washington Post wrote was \"mostly symbolic\" because it had no chance of succeeding in the Democratic Senate. (The plan passed in the Republican-controlled House.) The motion ultimately failed 40 to 57. Second, budget resolutions are not legally binding. Presidents do not sign them. It is a general outline of spending priorities that, when agreed upon, is a helpful guide. But it would require subsequent legislation to actually change Medicare programs to accomplish Ryan\u2019s goals. Still, it\u2019s probably fair to say McConnell was on the record supporting the Ryan budget, at least enough to get it to the Senate floor. But did it actually increase Disney\u2019s Medicare costs by $6,000? The Congressional Budget Office, the top fiscal scorekeeper for lawmakers, said implementing the 2011 Ryan plan would lead to an increase in out-of-pocket costs for seniors. How much? Instead of paying 27 percent of all their health care costs, seniors would be paying about 61 percent. (Worth noting: Ryan subsequently changed his plan to try to reduce the cost-sharing burden on seniors in later versions of his budget.) In real dollars, the Kaiser Family Foundation said the average senior would pay about $6,800 a year more in health care costs. The Grimes campaign also pointed us to 2011 studies by Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., and the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, that put the figure at about $6,350. But here\u2019s the catch: these figures looked at what a 65-year-old would pay in 2022. That\u2019s because under the Ryan plan, wholesale changes to the Medicare program would not directly affect anyone 55 or older. We learned from the Grimes campaign that Disney, the retiree in her ad, is 75 years old. So under no version of the Ryan plan would Disney be liable for the $6,000-plus in additional out-of-pocket costs that future beneficiaries would have faced if the proposal had passed. The Grimes campaign responded that in addition to changing Medicare for future beneficiaries, the Ryan budget also repealed the Affordable Care Act. That would affect current seniors in at least one way: prescription drug costs. How? Before the Affordable Care Act, seniors were required to pay 100 percent of prescription costs after the first $2,850 until they surpassed $4,550, at which point they would qualify for catastrophic coverage. By 2020, the Affordable Care Act eliminates that gap. If Obamacare was repealed, this benefit would disappear for seniors, including those currently 65 or older. So some seniors would pay more in prescription drug costs, though we don\u2019t know how much on average. Ryan\u2019s budget also would have cut federal spending for Medicaid, the joint federal-state program for low-income individuals, and converted the program into block grants that states could decide how to spend, Grimes\u2019 campaign added. While we don\u2019t know how states would have used the money, it\u2019s possible changes to Medicaid could have impacted low-income seniors who receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. Again, that figure is not concrete. These are both relevant talking points and worthy of consideration in the grand debate on Ryan\u2019s proposal. However, they have little to do with the $6,000 figure used in the ad."

    "doc": "Texas schools will be open this fall, but parents will be allowed to choose between sending their children to in-person classes or keeping them home for virtual instruction, per new guidance issued by the state\u2019s education agency on Tuesday. The decision received mixed reviews from educators, parents and state officials, some of whom cited rising infection rates, hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 in the state as a point of concern. In an interview with a television station in Dallas on Thursday, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn said he thinks the most important factor in opening schools should be safety. \"The good news is, when you look at the numbers, no one under the age of 20 has died of the coronavirus,\" said Cornyn, a Republican. \"We still don\u2019t know whether children can get it and transmit it to others.\" But is that accurate? Cornyn did not return a request for comment seeking more information about his statement. A spokesperson for the senator told NBC DFW on Friday that Cornyn \"could have been more precise with his language,\" but his information came from a July 9 tweet shared by Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. In reply to a question about children and the coronavirus, Gottlieb wrote: \"Balance of data clearly shows they\u2019re less likely to become infected and less likely to transmit infection. But IMHO we need to have humility on this question and recognize we don\u2019t fully understand all the risks; and while kids are less vulnerable, less risk doesn\u2019t mean no risk.\" Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie told the Houston Chronicle that Cornyn \"was not questioning whether children can catch the virus \u2014 of course they can. He was questioning the likelihood that children can catch it and THEN transmit it.\" Let\u2019s dive in. Looking at infection numbers, deaths People of any age can contract the coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19. \"Everyone is at risk for getting COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus,\" reads a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage on the virus. \"Some people are more likely than others to become severely ill, which means that they may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die.\" Some independent research and a preliminary report from the CDC show that children may be less likely to contract the virus than adults. Plus, the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age. But that does not mean children cannot contract the virus or experience illness as a result. The latest analysis from the CDC shows that roughly 6% of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States have been among people 17 years old and under \u2014 1.4% have been in people under 4 and 4.6% between 5 and 17. In Texas, about 7% of the 24,459 coronavirus cases with a completed investigation have been people under 19 \u20142.3% have been people under 9 and 4.8% between 10 and 19. National and state data also show that Cornyn is wrong to say no person under 20 has died from the coronavirus. Across the United States, 29 people under the age of 14 and 142 people between the ages of 15 and 24 have died after contracting the coronavirus. In Texas, state data does not show any coronavirus fatalities for people younger than 19 \u2014 but the state has investigated just 703 of the state\u2019s reported 2,918 fatalities. According to media reports, some children have died after contracting the virus in the state. In April, a 17-year-old girl in Lancaster died of complications related to the coronavirus, according to the Dallas Morning News. On Friday, health officials in Corpus Christi reported \"a COVID-19 related death of a six week old infant,\" according to Ben Molina, a city council member in the area. Exploring transmission Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, chief of Pediatric Infectious Disease at UT Southwestern Medical Center, told NBC DFW in a July 3 interview that children are able to contract and transmit the virus. \"We know that children should be less prone to severe disease and viral infections, that\u2019s not to say children can\u2019t get sick,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve had many examples of children getting sick. We also know that children can spread the virus and not be symptomatic.\" But the extent to which children spread the virus remains under-studied, and it is likely that children play a small role in the bulk of virus transmission. \"So far, researchers agree that children are not contracting the new coronavirus at the same rate as adults,\" reads a report from the Advisory Board, a health care research and consulting firm. \"But research has yet to show whether young children transmit the new coronavirus at a similar rate as adults.\" Robert Redfield, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, spoke about whether children returning to schools pose a risk of spreading the virus during a briefing of the White House Task Force on Wednesday. \"We really don\u2019t have evidence that children are driving the transmission cycle of (the coronavirus),\" he said. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said that could be due to lack of testing among children. \"It really comes to the evidence base of: what do we have as far as testing and children?\" she said during the same press briefing. \"So, if you look across all of the tests that we\u2019ve done and when we have the age, the portion that has been the lowest-tested portion is the under-10-years-old.\" Two international studies conducted on children\u2014 one focused on China and the other based in Germany \u2014offer \"compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus,\" according to the New York Times. A preliminary report from the CDC on the coronavirus in children said children are less likely to show typical symptoms of the coronavirus like fever or cough. \"Social distancing and everyday preventive behaviors remain important for all age groups as patients with less serious illness and those without symptoms likely play an important role in disease transmission,\" the report reads."

    "doc": "A new political ad from Democrats shows seniors running a lemonade stand, cutting the grass, and even stripping at a bachelorette party -- all to raise money to pay for Medicare.The stripper, dressed as a firefighter, bellows, \"Did someone call the fire department? Because it's about to get HOT in here!\" The young women throw money at him while he dances around with a pink feather boa. (See the ad here.)\"Seniors will have to find $12,500 for health care,\" the ad says, \"because Republicans voted to end Medicare.\"So do grandparents have to go back to work because of a Republican vote? Not really.The Republican proposal explainedThe ad critiques a budget proposal from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee. Ryan\u2019s plan would dramatically cut federal spending in the name of fiscal discipline, and it has widespread support in the Republican caucus.One of the its major features is dramatically restructuring Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for those 65 and older. Right now, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries contribute premiums for some types of coverage, and younger workers contribute payroll taxes.Ryan\u2019s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would receive \"premium support,\" which means they would buy plans from private insurance companies with financial assistance from the government. People who need more health care would get a little more money. Some call this a voucher program, but the proposal says it\u2019s not a voucher plan, because the government would pay the insurance companies directly.The proposal requires private insurers to accept all applicants and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would comply with standards to be set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67, and it provides smaller premium support to high earners.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed Ryan\u2019s proposal and found that it will save the government money. But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for insurance.\"A private health insurance plan covering the standardized benefit would, CBO estimates, be more expensive currently than traditional Medicare. Both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare,\" the CBO concluded.Ryan says the plan would offer more choice for Medicare participants and increase competition among private insurers to drive down cost.What the ad gets wrongYes, the Republican plan would be a huge change to the current program, and seniors would have to pay more for their health plans if it becomes law. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, have said they are strongly opposed to the plan.But to say the Republicans voted to end Medicare, as the ad does, is a major exaggeration. All seniors would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program\u2019s budget would increase every year.Republicans say that future spending projections for Medicare are not sustainable, and the program requires changes. Their proposal \"protects and preserves Medicare -- with no disruptions -- for those in and near retirement and provides those now under the age of 55 with a strengthened, personalized Medicare program they can count on when they retire,\" said Conor Sweeney, a spokesperson for House Budget Committee.Democrats, though, contend that the proposal would change the essential nature of Medicare as a guarantee of health coverage for seniors. The Congressional Budget Office released a detailed analysis of the proposal, and concluded that future beneficiaries would pay more for current levels of coverage, and that some will decide to go without any insurance.The Republican proposal will end the aspect of Medicare that directly covers specific services, such as hospital coverage. \"It's as if you took the Office of Faith-Based Partnerships and ended the faith-based portion of it, but continued to call it faith-based,\" said Jesse Ferguson of the DCCC. \"There is no doubt that Medicare -- a health insurance program for seniors -- would end under the House Republican plan and, according to the independent Congressional Budget Office, health insurance costs would rise for seniors.\"Democrats, including Obama, have said the plan would end Medicare \"as we know it,\" a critical qualifier. But the 30-second ad from the DCCC makes a sweeping claim without that important qualifier . Another problem with the ad is that it claims that participants would have to find $12,500 to pay for Medicare. That number is based on statistics compiled by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The ad doesn\u2019t mention, though, that the number includes money that would go to Medicare in any case. The CBO estimates beneficiaries would contribute about $6,150 in premiums in 2022 if the program isn\u2019t changed at all. So the extra money seniors need to pay under the Republican proposal is more like $6,350.Still another problem with the ad involves who\u2019s immediately affected by the Republican proposal. In one scene, the ad shows a senior citizen pushing a walker behind a lawn mower. A teenager looking on eats an apple and says, \"You missed a spot.\" In reality, people 55 and older won\u2019t see changes under the Ryan plan. It\u2019s actually that teenager -- or anyone else 54 or younger -- who would pay extra money when they are older.And finally, the ad neglects another critical fact: The Republicans voted on a budget resolution that states policy preferences, but the vote did not actually change Medicare, much less end it. As we\u2019ve noted before in previous fact-checks, budget resolutions are non-binding documents that cannot be viewed as the equivalent of legislation that establishes law. Deeply desiring something and accomplishing it are different.We ran this by Richard Kaplan, an elder law expert at the University of Illinois, who agreed the Republicans have not voted to end Medicare.\"Nobody voted to end it,\" he said. \"They voted to hopefully change it one day, when they get a chance, but they would need a Republican-dominated Senate and a Republican president, neither of which they have.\"\"It\u2019s not as if this is of no consequence. But it doesn\u2019t change Medicare,\" he said."

    "doc": "More than a dozen Senate Democrats called a news conference on Jan. 14, 2014, to draw attention to their efforts to curb climate change. One of those senators -- Chris Murphy, D-Conn. -- focused his remarks on the impact of public opinion on advancing an agenda on climate-change policy. Murphy said that advocates for policies to address climate-change \"have to convince Republicans -- and those who would stand against the action that we're proposing -- of the electoral consequences of continuing to ignore this issue. We have to tell Republicans that if they ultimately want to stop the hemorrhaging from young voters in this country, they need to start paying attention to this issue, because only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening.\" We wondered whether Murphy\u2019s polling data was sound. Thanks to some previous reporting by our colleagues at PolitiFact Rhode Island, we quickly found a poll that appears to be the source for Murphy\u2019s claim. It was commissioned by the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, and conducted by a polling team that included one Democratic firm and one Republican firm. The poll was taken between July 8 and July 10, 2013, with 600 respondents, all of whom were registered voters between 18 and 34 who voted in the 2012 general election. The poll asked, \"Which of the following best describes your view of climate change?\" Here are the responses: \u2022 Climate change is a severe threat that we must start addressing now: 55 percent \u2022 Climate change is an issue to address in the years ahead, but it's not urgent now: 11 percent \u2022 Climate change may be happening, but it's a natural event that humans can't affect: 27 percent \u2022 Climate change is not really happening: 3 percent \u2022 Don't know: 3 percent This appears to support Murphy\u2019s claim. We should note a few quibbles. \u2022 The poll was paid for by an environmental group. We always believe it\u2019s worth noting whenever someone cites a poll paid for by a group with a perspective and a stake in the issue. However, the fact that two polling firms, one from each party, were included makes the poll somewhat more credible. \u2022 On a subsequent question in the same poll -- \"When, if ever, will the consequences of climate change personally affect people like you?\" -- the number answering \"never\" was 6 percent. That\u2019s higher than 3 percent, though both are small percentages in the larger scheme of things. \u2022 There\u2019s one other poll that asks a similar question and finds different results. But they aren\u2019t exactly comparable. The Pew Research Center -- an independent polling organization -- surveyed a national sample of 1,504 adults age 18 or older between Oct. 9 and Oct. 13, 2013. One of the questions Pew asked was: \"From what you\u2019ve read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?\" Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 73 percent said the earth is warming, and 18 percent said it was not warming -- quite a bit higher than the 3 percent from the other poll. The two polls use different age ranges, but if respondents up to age 34 were added in, that would likely increase the percentage of global-warming deniers further, since an even higher percentage of 30- to 49-year olds said there was no global warming -- 28 percent. Why such divergent responses? One factor could be the precise wording of each poll. But a bigger difference is likely the pool of respondents. The LCV poll only counted answers from \"registered voters \u2026 who voted in the 2012 general election,\" while the Pew poll simply asked \"adults.\" This means the poll results aren\u2019t comparable in an apples-to-apples fashion. This difference might have posed a problem for Murphy, but he was careful with how he worded his claim. He said \"3 percent of voters\" -- not \"3 percent of Americans.\" So we don\u2019t find fault on these grounds. \"Pollsters don\u2019t ask about climate change very often,\" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"Most polls show that most people believe global warming is real. The question for policy makers is what kind of priority it should be, and here, many pollsters show it not to be very high.\""

    "doc": "A Texas meat processor who questions a government-approved bait that kills feral hogs charges there\u2019s no public research on the product. Will Herring, owner of the Hubbard-based Wild Boar Meat Company, which makes hog meat into pet food, has said he fears the product\u2019s active ingredient--warfarin, long known as a rat poison and human blood thinner--will damage his business. Also, Herring said: \"There\u2019s not one public study, and by public study I mean a study available to the public, that has looked at using the product Kaput to poison feral hogs,\" a comment we spotted in a March 6, 2017, news story in the San Antonio Express-News. A note: Public studies of particular pesticides don\u2019t appear to be mandatory. An Environmental Protection Agencyweb page about registering pesticides says only that the \"company that wants to produce the pesticide must provide data from studies that comply with our testing guidelines\" without mention of whether the studies must be public or, say, conducted independently. That web page also says that before registering a product, EPA develops risk assessments evaluating the potential harms to humans, wildlife, fish, and plants, including endangered species and non-target organisms plus any possible contamination of surface water or groundwater from leaching, runoff and \"spray drift.\" Still, Herring persuaded a state district judge to issue a temporary order putting a hold on state rules approving Kaput\u2019s use by state-licensed pesticide applicators and state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, filed a proposal barring the state from registering any lethal pesticide, including warfarin, for feral hog control unless a state agency or university performs and publishes a scientific study weighing the pesticide\u2019s environmental and economic effects. Both moves happened after Sid Miller, the Republican state agriculture commissioner, announced the Texas Department of Agriculture would issue rules limiting Kaput\u2019s sale and use to licensed individuals. When we inquired, the state agency emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that Colorado-based Scimetrics, the company poised to vend Kaput, fielded $136,854 in research grants from TDA from 2013 into 2017. All told in 2016-17, the sheet indicates, the agency awarded $802,500 to fight feral hogs; that counts funds awarded to counties, universities and other agencies. Feral hogs can be fearsome nuisances.Nationally, as many as 750,000 are harvested annually, yet how they ravage rural and suburban lands remains a problem--and Texas is home to more than 2 million of them. No public study? We asked Herring how he reached his conclusion about no public studies. By phone, he told us that he didn\u2019t find specific studies of the product in online searches nor, he said, did Genesis Laboratories, the Colorado-based company that developed the product,provide a study at his firm's inquiry. We also reached Richard Poch\u00e9, Genesis Labs' president, who conceded that no Kaput study has been formally published. He said, though, the company completed a study in Texas in 2015 submitted under the title \"Field efficacy of a warfarin bait used to control feral hog populations\" for consideration by the Wiley-published Wildlife Society Bulletin, which describes itself as a journal for wildlife practitioners that effectively integrates cutting-edge science with management and conservation, and also covers important policy issues, particularly those that focus on the integration of science and policy. By email, the bulletin\u2019s editor, Kansas State University\u2019s David Haukos, confirmed that study was submitted. In March 2017, Haukos told us: \"The manuscript is currently undergoing peer-review; therefore, no decision has been made concerning publication.\" Poch\u00e9 said by phone the 2015 study was followed up by another in 2016 with a third study underway in 2017, each one based on feeding the Kaput product to feral hogs. Both of the first two studies, he said, decimated exposed hog populations in North Texas study areas; he noted too the bait usesonly one-fifth of the warfarinfound in conventional rat and mouse baits. We asked for a copy of the 2015 study. By email,Poch\u00e9 said that remains \"confidential business information,\" and that releasing it before publication would leave his company with no control of where it ends up. Poch\u00e9 otherwise provided two of his own March 2017 PowerPoint presentations on Kaput along with the printed program for the April 2016 International Wild Pig Conference program in Myrtle Beach, S.C. A section of the program, \"Feral hog control using a new bait,\" evidently describes a Scimetric study. It opens: \"An EPA Experimental Use Permit was obtained to conduct a field trial using a novel bait to control feral hogs. The product, 12-years under development, was used to determine the efficacy against feral hogs on test sites 50 miles east of Plainview, Texas. Two paraffin bait formulations were tested, containing 0.005% and 0.01% warfarin. Hog activity was monitored pre- and post-treatment using trail cameras near feeders, VHF and GPS transmitting equipment, and bait consumption.\" Next, the summary says: \"Bait was applied in modified commercial feeders with heavy lids. Baiting initiated on June 1 and terminated June 30, 2015. After the 30-day exposure period efficacy on the 5-km treatment plot baited with 0.005% warfarin was 100%, 98.6%, and 97.8% using radio-tracking, trail camera images, and bait consumption. Efficacy on the 0.01% warfarin bait plot was not as effective. Ninety-seven non-target searches were conducted during the treatment and post-treatment phases to examine for mortality, for which none were found,\" an indication other animals weren\u2019t killed by the bait. The text closes: \"The low warfarin concentrate bait proved effective in eliminating wild hogs while posing minimal exposure to non-target wildlife.\" The longer of the PowerPoint presentations includes a slide stating that warfarin was approved as a rodent-killer in 1948 and as a human drug six years later. The presentation also has several slides titled: \"Field Efficacy of a Feral Hog Bait Containing 0.005% Warfarin,\" with a subtitle indicating the slides refer to research in North Texas from 2015 into 2017. Images include feral hogs wearing GPS collars or tagged for tracking by radio. One slide summarizes the research results by different methods of making hog counts: SOURCE: Presentation, \"Where we\u2019ve been and where we\u2019re going with Warfarin for controlling wild pigs,\" March 1, 2017, Richard Poch\u00e9, Genesis Labs (received by email from Poch\u00e9, March 9, 2017) Company: No independent research \u2018necessary\u2019 Poch\u00e9, asked if independent research makes sense before Kaput goes commercial, emailed: \"Not necessary. We do research under what is called Good Laboratory Practices, which is required by the EPA. No one can match the quality and integrity of the work.\" According to an EPA web page, the agency conducts audits to ensure companies developing pesticide products comply with those practices. EPA registration Our search of EPA\u2019s web site led us to a Jan. 3, 2017, agency document indicating that on Jan. 3, 2017, Kaput Feral Hog Bait was registered with the agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. \"Registration is in no way to be construed as an endorsement or recommendation of this product by the Agency,\" the document further states. \"In order to protect health and the environment, the Administrator, on his motion, may at any time suspend or cancel the registration of a pesticide in accordance with the Act.\" Also, the document says, the product is \"conditionally registered\" in accord with section 3(c)(7)(a) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act; the section says the EPA administrator may conditionally register a pesticide if the pesticide is \"identical or substantially similar\" to a registered pesticide and approving the registration wouldn\u2019t \"significantly increase the risk of any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment.\" Another agency web page says: \"If EPA finds that the pesticide meets the standard for registration, but there are outstanding data requirements, the Agency may, under certain circumstances, grant a \u2018conditional\u2019 registration pursuant to FIFRA section 3(c)(7). However, before granting a conditional registration, EPA must determine that, although an application lacks some of the required data, use of the pesticide would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on people or the environment during the time needed to generate the necessary data.\" We asked Poch\u00e9 about \"outstanding data requirements\" with Kaput, as mentioned generally by the EPA. By email, Poch\u00e9 said a \"1-year storage stability study\" for Kaput has been submitted to the EPA. Poch\u00e9 unpacked: \"An EPA-registered pesticide requires stability of the chemical in the formula available to the public. The product is stored in the marketing container on the shelf at room temperature over a one-year period. The bait is analyzed every 3 months for the warfarin concentration. That analysis is done at the beginning and at 3, 5, 9, and 12 months after manufacturing. The goal is to ensure the bait is good after 1 year and the concentration of warfarin is plus or minus 10% of what the EPA label requires. In our case the concentrations were within 1% of the label requirements,\" Poch\u00e9 said. Over a couple days, we did not draw an EPA response to Herring\u2019s claim. Otherwise the National Pesticide Information Center, which partners Oregon State University with the EPA, responded to our inquiry by pointing out a 1991 EPA \"fact sheet\" on warfarin that states the EPA evaluates pesticides by obtaining from producers a \"complete set of studies showing the human health and environmental effects of each pesticide. The Agency imposes any regulatory controls that are needed to effectively manage each pesticide's risks,\" the sheet says. State intends limits Miller, the state agriculture commissioner, is a former legislator who authored the Texas law enabling hunters to shoot at feral hogs from helicopters. At the TDA, spokeswoman Jennifer Dorsett responded to our inquiry about the absence of public studies of Kaput. Dorsett said by email: \"Kaput is an entirely proprietary product, so studies on the Kaput Feral Hog Bait are owned by the company and you would have to contact them directly to see if they will release them to you.\" Also by email, TDA spokesman Mark Loeffler stressed that while the state agency helped fund Kaput research, its role is generally limited to cataloging pesticides approved by EPA, including Kaput, though Miller applied his authority to make Kaput \"state limited use,\" to be sold by licensed dealers and used by licensed applicators, Loeffler said. \"We do not do state-paid studies of proposed pesticides,\" Loeffler wrote. \"We are not required to do lengthy study of a product because we have little discretion to reject or deny\" registrations, he said. Dorsett otherwise provided a document listing a dozen reportson poisoning feral hogs,issued from 1987 through 2002, including seven titles specifying \"warfarin,\" we tallied. Dorsett said the agency\u2019s toxicologist, Michael Hare, used the reports as references in evaluating Kaput as a state-limited-use pesticide. Dorsett told us relevant research also has involved the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service, which says it has officials in nearly every county demonstrating \"the latest technology and best practices to improve the state\u2019s food and fiber system.\" We didn't hear back from the service. Loeffler added that Miller has personally drawn on a 1995 post about warfarin\u2019s history as a rat poison and its toxicity to animals put out byuniversities teamed in the Extension Toxicology Network. Excerpt: \"Warfarin is only slightly dangerous to humans and domestic animals when used as directed, but care must be taken with young pigs, which are especially susceptible.\" Also, the post says, warfarin--which is insoluble in water--poses no threat to aquatic organisms and is \"practically non-toxic\" to game birds, with chickens \"relatively resistant.\""

The article also mentions a Texas Education Agency report that provides similar figures for 2013, showing an increase to 65% and 66% for English and math respectively.\n\nAdditionally, the article cites a SAT score of 1550 out of 2400 as being indicative of college readiness, with 34% of Texas students meeting this threshold in 2014.

    "doc": "Deep in the May 2016 Texas Supreme Court ruling that upheld and critiqued the current school funding system is encouraging news about the performance ofTexas students. On Page 58 of the majority opinion, Justice Don Willett (who subsequently showed up among individuals that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he\u2019d consider to succeed Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court) refers to a November 2005 decision by the court that required lawmakers to change the system. At the time of the West Orange-Cove II ruling, Willett writes, \"the percentage of students meeting the college-readiness standards of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board stood at 28% in English and 42% in math. Those figures stood at 65% and 66% in 2013,\" Willett continues. Did Texas highschool graduates get so much more college-primed that fast? Best we could tell, the cited figures track with state test results tracked by the Texas Education Agency. Then again, as few as 26 percent of Texas high-school graduates lately show a readiness for college according to a couple of other respected metrics. Texas Success Initiative With help from Texas Education Agency officials, we found figures very close to what Willett presents in the 2016 majority opinion. According to the agency, in 2004, 29 percent of students fulfilled college readiness standards for English language arts and 43 percent did so for math while in 2013, 65 percent of students met readiness standards for English, 66 percent for math. With rare exception, according to the agency, the percentage of students fulfilling each readiness standard escalated steadily through the intervening years. And most recently, in 2014, 68 percent of students met the English readiness standards with 67 percent doing so in math, the agency says. We wondered what the percentages meant. They reflect student test results, TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson advised, in keeping with a state law that requires college and universities to assess incoming high school graduates for their readiness to take college courses and offer remedial instruction as needed. Under the program, called the Texas Success Initiative, the TEA has reported on the readiness of high-school students by calculating the share of students who meet related expectations on the state-mandated English language arts and math 11th grade/exit-level Texas Assessment of Knowledge & Skills. Asked if perhaps standards loosened between 2004 and 2013, Culbertson pointed out by email that in each of the years, a student classified as ready for college needed \"scale scores of 2200\" on each relevant TAKS including a 3 (out of a possible 4) on the writing portion of the English test. To our inquiry, Shannon Housson, TEA director of performance reporting, said by phone the 124 percent and 54 percent respective improvements in students meeting the readiness standards over nine years reflected schools and students adjusting to and, in some cases, mastering the English and math TAKS, which were given from 2003 through 2011 before yielding to the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness. At its inception, Housson said, the TAKS added up to a \"significant increase in rigor\" for students accustomed to the previous state-mandated exams. \"I remember the angst in the schools,\" Housson said, as teachers and others came to terms with the new focus on \"higher-order thinking skills\" linked to the state-set curriculum rather than simply academic skills. Finally, Willett\u2019s citation of the 2005 court decision on school finance led us to look back at how that opinion by Justice Nathan Hecht presented the percentages of students meeting the readiness standards. In the ruling, Hecht showed results for all students plus break-outs suggesting considerable performance lags among African American, Hispanic and Limited English Proficient students. Results for 2013 suggest such gaps have closed quite a bit except among students the state deems English Language Learners. Texas Students With Test Scores Suggesting College Readiness, 2004 and 2013 Subject All Students African-American Hispanic White LEP/ELL* English (2004) 29% 19% 20% 36% 3% Math (2004) 43% 21% 29% 56% 13% English (2013) 65% 55% 60% 74% 14% Math (2013) 61% 51% 55% 71% 12% *Limited English Proficient/English Language Learners SAT, ACT scores There are other ways to gauge college readiness. In 2014, nearly 34 percent of the state\u2019s students who took the pre-college SAT (or 32 percent of public school students taking the test) did well enough to demonstrate a readiness for college work without remediation,according tothe College Board, which associates an SAT score of 1550 out of 2400 with a 65 percent probability of obtaining a first-year college GPA of B- or higher. The same year, among 60 percent of 116,147 Texas high school graduates to take the ACT scored well enough to show a readiness for college English,the Iowa-based group says, with 47 percent doing so in math and 36 percent demonstrating readiness in science--and only 26 percent clearing all the tests\u2019 college-readiness benchmarks. ACT says its readiness benchmarks are \"scores on the ACT subject-area tests that represent the level of achievement required for students to have a 50% chance of obtaining a B or higher or about a 75% chance of obtaining a C or higher in corresponding credit-bearing first-year college courses.\""

    "doc": "Rick Scott began his second term as Florida\u2019s governor in much the same fashion as he started his first -- by railing against high taxes. In his inaugural address on Jan. 6, 2015, Scott boasted that scads of people had moved to Florida in recent years, allegedly lured by the state\u2019s lack of income tax and low cost of living. \"Over the last 20 years, millions of people have escaped from states with climbing tax rates to move to states with lower taxes,\" Scott said. \"For starters, estimates say individuals who escaped these high tax states have taken with them around $2 trillion of adjusted gross income. They\u2019re voting with their feet.\" Scott went on to point out that between 1992 to 2011, New York and Illinois had lost billions in adjusted gross income, and that \"their No. 1 destination was Florida.\" The Sunshine State, meanwhile, had \"inherited\" more than $100 billion in adjusted gross income from other states in the same time period. Considering Florida just last year passed New York as the third-most populous state in the union, it\u2019s obvious people are moving into the state. We wondered about the larger point here, whether $2 trillion in adjusted gross income transferred into Florida and other states to avoid higher taxes. Feet not really voting Scott\u2019s office told us the estimate came from author and tax wonk Travis H. Brown\u2019s book How Money Walks: How $2 Trillion Moved Between the States, and Why It Matters, which touts adjusted gross income movement as proof that states with high taxes persistently lose population and money to low-tax states. Brown\u2019s publicist did not respond to our request for comment, so we couldn\u2019t ask him specifics about his theory. His essential argument, according to his book, is that \"it appears that there is a direct correlation between state personal income tax rates and incomemigration. Money is walking, and we can see exactly where it\u2019s going.\" Brown combined Internal Revenue Service and Census data of the adjusted gross income (defined as all the money a person makes minus adjustments) of people who moved between states in a 15-year period between 1995 and 2010, using available records. He argued these stats show how these migrations affected states, including Florida, which is the largest net income beneficiary using this point of view, to the tune of $86.4 billion over 15 years, according to Brown. Similar conclusions about taxpayer migration have been drawn by the business-backed Tax Foundation and the New York-based Empire Center. The argument has become a popular anti-tax talking point, just as Scott used it. We ran Brown\u2019s methodology by a number of experts, and we didn\u2019t find many economists who know of Brown\u2019s work well enough to comment on it. Brown identifies himself as a \"political consultant and legislative lobbyist by trade\" in his book. Cristobal Young, a Stanford sociologist who has co-authored studies on millionaire migration in New Jersey and California that found tax rates had little impact on migration, said he was familiar with Brown\u2019s book and website but paid little attention to them because Brown\u2019s conclusions are \"not an academic or scientific work.\" One economist who did critique Brown was Michael Mazerov of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Mazerov said that it\u2019s not clear from Brown\u2019s book whether the $2 trillion number is meant to represent all the money moving out of high tax states into low tax states, or whether it\u2019s simply the sum of all adjusted gross income moving across states, i.e. all the money that didn\u2019t stay in the same state over a 15-year period. That\u2019s a critical distinction, and we found contradictory wording in the book on that point. We tried to reach Travis to clear up this point, but we didn\u2019t hear back. We\u2019ll update this fact-check if we do. Looking at Brown\u2019s website tool, Florida\u2019s biggest gains were from New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania. But the state also lost residents to North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Arizona and Texas -- albeit far fewer people left the state, resulting in a net population gain. Florida is one of nine states with no individual income tax, along with Alaska, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming (some of those states do tax parts of a person\u2019s income, such as investment dividends). That means that while Florida is gaining residents in net migration, a good chunk of people are still moving out to states that have higher taxes than Florida. States with no income tax also usually have higher property or sales tax rates to compensate. The Tax Foundation said Florida ranked 27th in tax burden back in 2010. Mazerov raised other issues with Brown\u2019s theory, chiefly that it doesn\u2019t consider the full dynamics of people moving between the states. First, it\u2019s not as if taxed income simply evaporates or transfers if someone moves out of a state. In most cases, it\u2019s likely someone else in the state takes a job when someone leaves it. The person who moves would then earn income from another employer in their new state. Lyman Stone, formerly an economist with the Tax Foundation, has agreed on Medium.comthat Brown\u2019s IRS data \"simply doesn\u2019t show the migration of income, but rather shows the migration of people who formerly earned a given stream of income.\" Tracking income migration also doesn\u2019t account for people who move to new states but continue to work in their old ones, nor does it include people who move because they are laid off (their jobs simply don\u2019t exist anymore) or are part-time residents of the state -- which accounts for an estimated 800,000 people in Florida. That brings us to a host of caveats about the supposition that people are moving to Florida -- or any other state, really -- primarily for lower taxes. Research shows that taxes simply aren\u2019t a major consideration for people who move between states. Only about 2 percent or fewer Americans move between states in any given year, and factors such as new jobs, better weather, nearby family and housing costs are much more important. Brown\u2019s book acknowledges these factors, but still focuses on the correlation with states with low or no individual income taxes. According to a recent Gallup poll, the national average of people who say they plan to move within the next year who cite taxes as a reason is only 3 percent. Even residents of Scott\u2019s favorite punching bag, New York, only cited taxes 14 percent of the time as a reason for wanting to move. In Florida\u2019s case, where the cost of living is no longer as inexpensive as it used to be, climate is an especially strong factor, and the trend of more people moving from so-called \"Frostbelt\" states to \"Sunbelt\" states has been going on for decades. The University of Florida\u2019s Population Program in the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida has said jobs are the main reason people in their 20s, 30s and 40s move to the state, while climate is biggest for people in their 50s and 60s. One major factor common to all age groups? Family living in the area."

    "doc": "Just like baseball, New Hampshire's budget season is just getting under way. But even before legislators got their first swing at this year\u2019s spending proposal, political leaders were already checking the score. N.H. Democratic Party leaders took aim at the current 2012-13 budget on Twitter last month. They contrasted the Republican-led spending plan, crafted two years ago by Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley and former House Speaker William O\u2019Brien, with the 2010-11 budget, passed by Democratic Gov. John Lynch and Senate President Maggie Hassan, the current governor. \"NH FACT: Lynch/Hassan 2010/11 budget ended in $18m surplus,\" Democratic chairman Ray Buckley tweetedFriday, March 29th. \"OBrien/Bradley 2012/13 budget has $40m deficit.\" With nearly three months left in the 2013 Fiscal Year, the budget projections are constantly on the move. But, the 2010-11 figures have been set for a while. So, we decided to go back and check the record books. To start, we approached Democratic Party officers, who pointed to a PolitiFact check we conducted back in August looking into the 2010-11 budget. At the time, we checked a claimby the New Boston Republican Committee, that suggested Democrats had built up a deficit of $1 billion in Fiscal Year 2010-11. As we noted then, the $1 billion figure came from a report released in January 2011 by the Legislative Budget Assistant, a nonpartisan office that reviews the state spending plans. The report, intended as a point-in-time projection rather than a final budget tally, identified $845 million in spending that could have posed concerns for the new legislature if all fiscal policies remained the same. \"I was talking about appropriations that would go up by virtue of formula driven things,\" Jeff Pattison, the budget assistant, said at the time. \"Things that would happen if nothing was done about them.\" But, state legislators, required by law to balance the budget, made the necessary adjustments, and by the end of the year, they had built a $17.7 million surplus, according to the state\u2019s annual report. Some political leaders argued at the time the numbers were skewed because lawmakers relied heavily on borrowing (more than $130 million, according to some reports) and on one-time federal funds ($80 million-plus) to balance the budget, leaving a \"structural deficit\" heading into the next budget cycle. That year, Lynch, Hassan and other Democratic leaders removed the State Liquor Commission off state spending books by putting its $90 million budget in an independent enterprise account, and they saved another $90 million by issuing state-backed bonds rather than paying cash to cover school construction costs. Still, others maintained the surplus came through a range of budget cuts and tax hikes common to the budget cycle. They cut more than $233 million, laying off nearly 200 state workers, closing some programs and making the university system return $25 million in state aid, among other actions. Either way, the $17.7 million surplus officially left from the 2010-11 budget roughly matches the Democratic Party\u2019s $18 million claim. So, Buckley is on target on the first part of his claim. Now, on to the 2012-13 budget. To support their $40 million deficit claim, Democratic Party officers directed us toward a Fiscal Year 2013 snapshot, released last month by the budget assistant\u2019s office. As Buckley suggested, the worksheet, released March 12, did report a $40.7 million revenue shortfall, most of which comes from shortages in Medicaid Expansion Tax revenues ($36.8 million). But, like the 2011 report, Pattison, the budget assistant, intended this release only as a point-in-time projection to give legislators an idea of what could happen in the months to follow. The projections change frequently, Pattison said. \"I\u2019m not saying it changes on a daily basis, but it can change fairly quickly,\" he warned last week. By the end of March, the projections had changed course. According to a monthly revenue reportreleased Tuesday, April 2, by the Department of Administrative Services, state officials closed March with revenues up $26.6 million over the initial budget projections. If those numbers stand, that would leave the 2012-13 budget facing a $14 million deficit, and further revenues could level the spending by the end of the fiscal year, said Linda Hodgdon, commissioner of the administrative services department, who authored the March report. \"We're hopeful that because March was such a good month, April will also be a good month,\" Hodgdon said. \"If we have another good month, it could potentially close the gap. That\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping.\""

    "doc": "The Confederate flag flying outside of South Carolina\u2019s statehouse has sparked debate across the nation following the brutal shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. At the center of much of the fervor is what the flag stands for. For some, the flag is a symbol for a shared Southern heritage. For others, the flag is linked to the Confederate War Memorial, which sits next to it and honors fallen Confederate soldiers. And yet others, such as Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson, see the flag as a symbol for racial oppression and prejudice. \"Do you know when that flag was first flown at the Columbia statehouse in Columbia?\" he asked during an interview on Meet the Press June 21. \"1961 \u2026 it was a middle finger directed at the federal government. It was flown there as a symbol of massive resistance to racial desegregation. Period.\" \"It was only after Brown vs. Board, after Little Rock, after desegregation began, that South Carolinians put up the flag on the statehouse, that other states in the South adopted the battle flag as part of their state flags,\" Robinson said. \"So it was massive resistance.\" Here we wanted to to answer two questions. One is simple, when did the Confederate battle flag first fly above the South Carolina statehouse? And second, why? The first time it flew Daniel Hollis, a member of the commission responsible for planning South Carolina\u2019s Confederate War Centennial, recalled the exact day the flag was first hoisted during an interview published in 1999. Hollis said the flag itself went up on April 11, 1961, for the opening of the Civil War centennial \"at the request of Aiken Rep. John A. May.\" \"May told us he was going to introduce a resolution to fly the flag for a year from the capitol. I was against the flag going up,\" Hollis said, \"but I kept quiet and went along.\" The resolution was approved in 1962, but never included a date for the flag\u2019s removal. \"It just stayed up,\" Hollis said. \"Nobody raised a question.\" Hollis died in 2008. The flag\u2019s changing meaning So, yes, the flag didn\u2019t start flying until 100 years after the start of the Civil War. But why the flag was flown is -- like the flag itself -- subject to some debate. Robinson cited a study conducted by the state Senate of Georgia to help make his case. Although the study focuses on the history and evolution of Georgia\u2019s state flag, it also explores the different Confederate flags that have existed and how those flags have been used by states. The study pays special attention to what the different flags mean. \"It must be understood how the meaning of the battle flag has changed since the Civil War and explore what it meant at the time Georgia and other states adopted it or paid homage to it,\" the report reads. The study says that \"from the end of the Civil War until the late 1940s, display of the battle flag was mostly limited to Confederate commemorations, Civil War re-enactments, and veterans\u2019 parades. The flag had simply become a tribute to Confederate veterans.\" However, in 1948, the meaning of the flag began to change. That year, Dixiecrats flew the flag at their convention in Birmingham, Ala., as \"a symbol of Southern protest and resistance to the federal government.\" In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown vs. Boardthat segregation in education was unconstitutional. Georgia changed its state flag to embody the Confederate battle flag two years later. The period also saw Rosa Parks refuse to give up her seat on the bus (1955), the forced integration at Little Rock, Ark. (1957), and student sit-ins across the South (1960). We asked K. Michael Prince, author of Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys: South Carolina and the Confederate Flag, if he could pinpoint the root cause behind the raising of the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina. \"As far as I've been able to determine, the bare facts \u2026 provide no clear evidence either way,\" Prince said. \"It's possible that nobody had anything else in mind other than commemorating the war. But we would be remiss not to take the larger context into consideration in judging the meaning of the display,\" Prince said. Specifically, Prince cites arguments that broke out between a New Jersey centennial delegation and South Carolina. The National Civil War Centennial Commission meeting was to be held at a segregated hotel in Charleston, and a black delegate from New Jersey was denied admittance. New Jersey threatened to boycott all Charleston events in response. Eventually, a compromise was reached through the efforts of President John F. Kennedy. The meeting was moved to Charleston Naval Base where segregation was not in effect. \"The official opening of the Civil War Centennial became a divided event, with dual headquarters and dual programs,\" Prince wrote in his book. \"Except for a few luncheon speeches and the events held at Fort Sumter, centennial function followed separate (but equal) tracks.\" The dispute between New Jersey and South Carolina would go on to become the \"Number 1 Story of the Year\" in South Carolina\u2019s Sumter Daily Item."

The evidence provided does not support his assertion that black people kill more black people than the KKK did in 86 years. Therefore, the appropriate label for this claim is \"Conflicting.\"",
    "doc": "Some claims just catch the eye and Fox News contributor Allen West delivered one on his personal blog this week. \"Black people kill more black people every six months than the KKK did in 86 years,\" West, a former one-term congressman from Florida, wrote. We decided to see if the numbers back West up. West\u2019s office directed us to an item from Kevin Jackson who blogs at Black Sphere. Jackson wrote about \"Dixiecrats who hated black people, and who were responsible for the 3,446 deaths by the Klan in 86 years.\" For the moment, let\u2019s assume that number is correct and compare it to the data on black homicide victims. Here we need to make an estimate so we\u2019ll walk through our process. The Uniform Crime Reports gathered by the FBI show that 2,412 blacks died at the hand of another black person in 2012. That is the total for the year (not six months), but that number omits homicides where the race of the murderer is unknown. That is a huge data gap that somewhat complicates matters. The same FBI data, however, shows that most deaths occur within the same racial group. According to 2012 data, 91 percent of black deaths were caused by black criminals and 84 percent of white homicides were committed by whites. The total number of black homicides in 2012 was 6,454, according to the FBI. If the percentages hold, that would mean 5,874 homicides were committed by black criminals in all of 2012, or roughly 2,936 in a six-month span. Race of victim Total homicides Total-Race known White offender Black offender White 5,855 3,128 2,614 431 Black 6,454 2,648 193 2,412 Source: Uniform Crime Reports 2012 On its face, West\u2019s claim is wrong but not by a huge amount, and in previous years, he would have been closer. The number of black homicides has fallen steadily over the past seven years. If we had run the numbers in 2006, he would have been about 100 deaths short of being correct. As it is, he is off by about 15 percent. But West\u2019s claim has another error. The source West cites, Kevin Jackson, blames the Klan, but when Jackson emailed us with his source, an article on the conservative website Townhall.com, we found something a bit different. The article said \"According to a Tuskegee Institute study, between the years 1882 and 1968, 3,446 blacks were lynched at the hands of whites.\" It did not name the Ku Klux Klan and talked only of lynching, not all homicides. The Tuskegee Institute -- now Tuskegee University -- started documenting lynching cases in the 1890s, according to Richard Sutch, an editor of the Historical Statistics of the United States. The work is generally considered accurate, as Sutch told NPR. \"Many historians approached that data very skeptically,\" Sutch said. So scholars \"went back and they literally read every newspaper in a chosen southern state, and said we're going to record every instance of lynchings that are reported in these newspapers, and then they marched state by state by state. \"And what they found was not that the Tuskegee figures were wrong, but that the Tuskegee figures were essentially correct, and this amazed some people because the Tuskegee figures were showing that there were as many as 120, 150 lynchings per year in the southern United States. That's a lynching every week, more than once a week. It's just a steady drumbeat of violent oppression.\" We found copies of the Tuskegee work that confirms between 3,445 and 3,446 black documented lynchings (and another 1,300 lynchings of whites.) The archive, however, does not track KKK involvement. There is no question that blacks were at least twice as likely as whites to be the victims of lynchings, nor is there any doubt that the southern states accounted for most of these deaths. One study put the southern share at 90 percent. That doesn\u2019t mean the Klan was behind them. On that point, the historical record is unclear. For starters, historian Michael Pfeifer at the City University of New York says the Klan had three phases. Pfeifer wrote a book on mob violence, Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1847-1947. \"We simply don\u2019t have good statistics on how many African Americans the Ku Klux Klan murdered in the 1860s and 1870s when the 'first' Klan was active,\" Pfeifer told PunditFact. \"Evidence suggests, though, that the Reconstruction Klan murdered hundreds and perhaps several thousand blacks.\" That would seem to push the Klan death toll even higher, but Pfeifer says there\u2019s reason to question the Klan\u2019s role in the decades that followed. \"The Klan was not active during most of the years of the \u2018lynching frenzy\u2019 of the late 19th and early 20th century South,\" Pfeifer said. \"White lynchers in the Jim Crow-era from the 1890s through the 1910s carried on many of the same white supremacist values as the Ku Klux Klan had in the 1860s and 1870s, but it is not accurate to say that the Klan was involved in lynching in the 1890s and early 1900s.\" The Ku Klux Klan is a potent symbol of racism but the deadly violence against blacks, and, we should note, against more than 1,000 Jews, Catholics and other whites, came from a much wider group of Southern society in that period."

This means that Berger's claim is not inclusive of the full amount of raises teachers have received.\n\nBased on these facts, it is clear that Berger's claim of a 15% raise in teacher pay over the last three years is incorrect and misleading. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "Responding to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s \"State of the State\" speech Monday night, one of North Carolina\u2019s top Republican leaders said his party has given the average teacher a substantial raise in recent years. Part of Cooper\u2019s speech highlighted his proposal to give every teacher an extra $150 to buy textbooks for his or her classroom, since he said that their \"paychecks (are) stretched too thin already.\" Republican Sen. Phil Berger, the president pro tem of the senate, gave the official response to Cooper\u2019s speech. On the matter of education, Berger said he and his fellow Republicans deserve credit for giving teachers large raises. Berger told viewers to imagine a political party that had promised to \"raise average teacher pay by more than 15 percent in just three years.\" He spoke about a few more issues, then concluded: \"That is exactly what House and Senate Republicans have accomplished in our state.\" Actually, they did not. What he gets wrong In total, since the GOP took over control of the N.C. General Assembly in 2011, the average teacher\u2019s pay has not risen 15 percent. It has risen about half that much. And that\u2019s in the span of six years, not three. So Berger\u2019s claim citing a three-year period ignores half the budgets passed by Republican lawmakers. But still, we asked which three years Berger was talking about. His office told us it\u2019s the period from the 2014-15 school year until now. For reference, below is the average teacher pay in North Carolina for the last decade. Every budget starting in 2011-12 has been written and passed by Republican legislators. 2007-08: $47,354 2008-09: $48,648 2009-10: $46,850 2010-11: $46,605 2011-12: $45,933 2012-13: $45,737 2013-14: $44,990 2014-15: $47,819 2015-16: $47,985 2016-17: $49,837 Teacher pay began falling in 2009-10, under Democratic leadership. It continued falling in the next four budgets, three of which were written and passed by Republican legislators. Berger didn\u2019t want to talk about those three budgets, just the most recent three. Nevertheless, his claim is still wrong. As the data shows, the raises in each of the last three years have taken the average teacher's salary from just under $45,000 a year to just under $50,000. One of those years, as we found in a previous fact check of Republican House Speaker Tim Moore, was the nation's biggest. But it still wasn't enough to make Berger's claim accurate. There has beena 10.8 percent raise, not a 15 percent raise. So how does he explain the difference between his claim and reality? Any proof? Berger\u2019s office pointed us to a document from the state legislature that tracks pay changes for teachers and state employees each year since the 1970s. Amy Auth, Berger\u2019s deputy chief of staff, said it backs up his claim. At first glance, it does appear to show that the raises since 2014-2015 add up to 15.5 percent. But there are several caveats to that number. Part of that was a bonus teachers received last year, which didn\u2019t change their base pay and wasn\u2019t repeated again this year. In other words, it wasn\u2019t actually a raise. Also, in 2014 the state got rid of annual longevity bonuses for veteran teachers. At the same time, those teachers\u2019 base salaries went up. For that reason the state counted the change as a raise \u2013 yet the loss of longevity pay gave the raise an inflated value, and some veteran teachers actually would\u2019ve made more money if the change hadn\u2019t happened, The News & Observer reported at the time. But even if you take the full 15.5 percent statistic at face value, it still only counts the state\u2019s portion of teachers\u2019 salaries \u2013 which is only about two-thirds of the total. The rest comes from supplements paid by 108 of the state\u2019s 115 local school districts. So while some of the blame or credit for teacher pay will always rest outside the responsibility of legislative leaders like Berger, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that his claim isn\u2019t true. Furthermore, Berger in the past has frequently touted estimates that the state raised teacher pay to $50,000 this year. That would require counting the local supplements. His claim Monday also would have to include those local supplements, since he talked about the average salary. Yet his evidence ignored that, instead focusing only on the state\u2019s base salaries."

    "doc": "More than 1,300 people have died on Georgia roads this year, and 25 percent of the deaths are the result of drunken driving.

Put down the phone, and don\u2019t get behind the wheel if you\u2019ve been drinking,\" Gov. Nathan Deal warns listeners. For months, state officials have been alert to an unwelcome change: After falling annually for nine straight years, Georgia\u2019s traffic deaths were up this year. But have more than 1,300 people really died this year on Georgia roads? And have 25 percent \u2014 or one out of four of those deaths \u2014 been caused by drunken driving, as the public service announcement says? PolitiFact Georgia decided to rev up the Truth-O-Meter. Figures compiled by the state Department of Transportation and released through the Governor\u2019s Office of Highway Safety show traffic deaths in Georgia fell each year from 2005 to 2014, going from 1,729 to 1,170, even as U.S. census estimates show the state added about 1 million residents. Georgia roadway deaths for 2015 hit 1,345 as of Monday of this week. That's up 186, or 16 percent, from 2014, and it\u2019s still a few days until we turn the calendar to 2016. According to state data, the 1,345 included six people killed in car-train collisions, 192 pedestrians, 138 motorcyclists and 21 bicyclists. The largest number of traffic deaths occurred on state and local roads, 675 and 485, respectively. But deaths on interstates \u2014 often the most visible because of the gridlock that follows \u2014 are up 21 percent, from 153 in 2014 to 185 so far this year. But were 25 percent of this year's fatalities alcohol-related? The answer: That could well be the case, but officials don\u2019t know that with absolute certainty. Harris Blackwood, the director of the Governor\u2019s Office of Highway Safety, said his agency has certified data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showing that 297 of Georgia\u2019s 1,179 fatalities two years ago, or 25 percent, involved alcohol blood content of 0.08, the legal limit. Smaller amounts of alcohol \u2014 0.01 percent or higher \u2014 were found in 30 percent, or 349, of those fatalities in 2013, Blackwood said. Part of the reason they don\u2019t know for certain about the role of alcohol in 2015 traffic deaths is it can take months to obtain blood test results from the GBI crime lab, he said. \"However, there are indicators, such as open containers, information provided by other passengers, and so on,\" Blackwood said. \"The percentage of alcohol as a factor has been consistent on a percentage basis over a 10-year period, even as fatalities were going down prior to this year,\" he said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s website gives an extensive five-year view of fatal crashes in Georgia and the nation \u2014 including the role alcohol plays. Between 2010 and 2014, alcohol-impaired driving was a factor in 24 percent to 25 percent of all fatal accidents each year. The one exception was 2011, when the percentage dropped to 22 percent. Nationally, 30 percent to 31 percent of all fatalities in those same five years involved alcohol-impaired drivers (those with a blood alcohol content of 0.08 or above), according to the NHTSA data. Blackwood said the Governor\u2019s Office of Highway Safety also did a preliminary analysis early this year and found no evidence that \"the alcohol percentage is going down\" from prior years. In the first nine months of 2015, there were 483 instances where an officer requested an alcohol test or a driver refused an alcohol test, he said. (We should note that some law enforcement agencies consider it standard protocol to request a blood alcohol test in fatal traffic accidents.)"

This suggests that CHIP saves the government money because the alternatives cost more. The popularity of the program across party lines and the positive CBO score further support the claim. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim based on the evidence provided.",
    "doc": "As a federal government shutdown loomed, lawmakers discussed whether to fold the reauthorization of a popular children\u2019s health plan into a final legislative bargain. At her weekly press conference, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made the case for reauthorizing the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, for as long as possible. CHIP provides health coverage to certain low-income children and pregnant women whose family income levels are above the threshold to obtain Medicaid coverage. It is funded jointly by the federal government and the states. In 2016, CHIP served 8.9 million beneficiaries. The reauthorization \"should have been done in September, first of all,\" Pelosi said in her Jan. 18, 2018. \"Second of all, we wanted 10 years \u2026 which, by the way, saves $6 billion.\" Republicans, she added, rejected a 10-year reauthorization. \"Doing it for six years saves $1 billion. That's good,\" she said. \"Doing it 10 years, saving $6 billion is better. In fact, it's best.\" A few days later, after government funding had lapsed, lawmakers decided to include a six-year CHIP reauthorization in the bill that reopened the government. We were struck by Pelosi\u2019s claim that a federal program to provide health coverage for 8.9 million children and pregnant women could actually save the government money, rather than costing it. So we took a closer look. When we contacted Pelosi\u2019s staff, they pointed us to a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the pending reauthorization bill that had been released the previous day, Jan. 17. CBO is Congress\u2019 nonpartisan arbiter of projected costs of legislation. CBO said that a six-year CHIP reauthorization would produce an additional $8.204 billion in revenue, but only $7.223 billion in additional costs. That means a cumulative savings of $981 million, or nearly $1 billion. (It\u2019s in the chart on page 4 here.) As for a 10-year reauthorization, Pelosi\u2019s office pointed us to a Jan. 11, 2018, CBO analysis. The report projected a 10-year reauthorization \"would decrease the deficit by $6 billion over the 2018-2027 period.\" So Pelosi was correct on the numbers. The broader question: Why does CHIP save the government money? In short, it\u2019s because the alternatives cost more. According to CBO, \"extending funding for CHIP for 10 years yields net savings to the federal government because the federal costs of the alternatives to providing coverage through CHIP (primarily Medicaid, subsidized coverage in the marketplaces, and employment-based insurance) are larger than the costs of providing coverage through CHIP during that period.\" \"It\u2019s a very popular program across party lines, and the CBO score had it saving money,\" said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studies health care policy."

Dave Brat keeps telling voters in Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District that Democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger wants a $32 trillion tax increase to pay for a \"government takeover of health care.\" You don\u2019t have to look hard to find his claims. \"My opponent wants a tax increase of $32 trillion -- that's with a 'T'-- to pay for her socialist healthcare plan,\" Brat, a Republican, wrote in a Oct. 11 Facebook post. \"She and Nancy Pelosi want to...double down for a $32 trillion socialized takeover, government takeover, of health care,\" he said during and Oct. 15 debate with Spanberger. \"And we know Spanberger\u2019s health care plan would bankrupt Medicare as we know it - a $32 trillion spending increase that would double our taxes,\" says a Brat TV ad that debuted on Sept. 17. \"Spanberger\u2019s healthcare piece costs $32 trillion and will require you doubling the personal income tax rate - your personal taxes doubled - and the corporate rates doubled,\" Brat said during an Aug. 20 radio interview on the John Frederick Show, Spanberger has repeatedly denied Brat\u2019s charge. So we decided to test Brat\u2019s claim - that Spanberger wants a $32 trillion tax increase to pay for an overhaul of health care - on the Truth-O-Meter. Brat\u2019s Explanation Brat says his claim stems from a comment Spanberger made during a May 31 debate with Dan Ward, her opponent in this spring\u2019s Democratic primary. The candidates were asked for their \"feelings about single-payer healthcare,\" a system in which one entity - the government - is responsible for providing health insurance and paying claims. Brat notes that Spanberger, in reply, said, \"...I do, in principle, support single payer\u2026\". Brat says those words prove Spanberger supports the Medicare for All Act of 2017, proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The bill, which is languishing in the Senate Finance Committee, would create a Medicare program that covers all Americans under one plan. Employers would be barred from offering competing insurance. Sanders\u2019 plan would cover primary care, hospital visits, lab services, medical devices, maternity care, prescriptions and vision and dental care. The only copayments would be for prescriptions. The Mercatus Center, a free-market oriented research group at George Mason University, estimated Sanders\u2019 plan would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years. \"A doubling of all currently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan,\" the study, published in July 2018, said. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has not published a cost analysis of Sanders\u2019 plan. Brat has company among Republicans in claiming Spanberger endorsed Sanders\u2019 plan. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC aligned to Speaker Paul Ryan, has run a TV ad that accuses Spanberger of \"supporting a $32 trillion government takeover of healthcare and raising middle-class taxes.\" Full picture Spanberger, in answering the debate question, only briefly addressed a single-payer system. She spent most of her energy calling for the passage of Medicare X, a health care proposal that would give people under 65 an option: They could remain privately insured, or buy into a new government-run program that would use the network of Medicare providers and costs. The Medicare system is now reserved for elderly and disabled citizens. Brat focuses on one clause in Spanberger\u2019s answer. Here\u2019s a fuller excerpt of her remarks. \"I support Medicare X, which is a public option as a path towards universal coverage in the achievement of universal coverage. I believe that a public option is the way that we can achieve that goal through government-provided insurance that does, in fact, build off the existing Medicare network, because it exists in every single zip code across the country and that is the way we can achieve health care for everyone. And I do, in principle, support single-payer, but I believe universal coverage through a public option is the method I would pursue.\" Spanberger never mentioned Sanders. Nor was the senator referenced by the questioner or in the response by Ward - Spanberger\u2019s primary opponent. This is important because Brat not only accuses Spanberger of championing a single-payer system, he links her to Sanders\u2019 proposal and its costs.The Mercatus Center, a libertarian research organization affiliated with George Mason University, estimates Sanders\u2019 plan would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years and wouldn\u2019t be paid for even if income and corporate taxes were doubled. Sanders\u2019 plan is very generous. It would cover hospital visits, primary care, medical devices, lab services, maternity care, prescriptions as well as vision and dental care. It would not subject consumers to any out-of-pockets costs, except a copay on prescriptions. But if Congress wanted to, it could pass a single-payer system that would be cheaper than Sanders\u2019 plan, albeit still costly. For example, some single-payer countries require copays for medical treatment, some have don\u2019t cover dental and eye care, others don\u2019t cover long-term care. In other words, it\u2019s possible to support \"in principle\" a single payer system but be opposed to Sanders\u2019 plan. Spanberger repeatedly has said she\u2019s against Sanders\u2019 bill and denounced Brat\u2019s attack as \"false.\"It\u2019s a mystery what she meant when she said she supports single payer \"in principle.\" We found no evidence of her making a similar statement. When we asked Justin Jones, spokesman for Spanberger\u2019s campaign, to explain the remark, he said, \"She hasn\u2019t seen any single-payer plan she supports.\" He wouldn\u2019t elaborate. Brat says Spanberger changed her position on Sanders\u2019 bill after an Aug.3 editorial in the Richmond Times-Dispatch criticized its $32.6 trillion estimated cost and said the measure would lead to \"socializing medicine.\" The editorial didn\u2019t mention Spanberger. Final Note: Medicare X has not been subjected to a rigid cost analysis. Supporters say it would at least break even because the bill requires that premiums \"cover the full actuarial cost of offering such a plan, including administrative costs.\" A 2013 CBO study concluded a similar program would reduce federal deficits by $158 billion over 10 years."

    "justification": "The claim that the percentage of black children born without a father in the home has risen from 7% in 1964 to 73% today, due to changes from President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society, is False. The evidence provided in the article disputes this claim in several ways:\n\nFirstly, there is no federal data on \"black children born without a father in the home\". Instead, the article analyzes two types of data that are similar but not a perfect fit: unmarried black births as a percentage of all black births and the percentage of black children living without a father in the home. However, these measurements offer limited support for the claim, with the overall increase being more limited than the meme suggests.\n\nSecondly, the article notes that rates of fatherlessness among both whites and blacks have increased over time, with a tripling of the percentage of white children living in single-mother households between 1960 and 2013. This suggests that the increase in black single parenthood cannot be solely attributed to changes from the Great Society.\n\nThirdly, the article highlights that the data for both black and white marriage is unreliable, with many black mothers misreporting their marital status and young white women getting married and divorced repeatedly. This could mean that the frequency of non-marital births among African Americans may have been higher than officially indicated, and the white rate of non-marital births may have been artificially low.\n\nFinally, the article emphasizes that correlation does not equal causation, with many other factors contributing to the rise in single-motherhood rates for both blacks and whites. The article concludes that while the Great Society may have had some impact on single motherhood rates, it is unlikely to be the primary cause of the observed increase.\n\nBased on these points, it is reasonable to label the claim as False, as the evidence provided does not support the suggested increase in black children born without a father in the home due to changes from President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society.",
    "doc": "A reader recently sent us a bare-knuckled Facebook meme about race and fatherhood. The meme features a photograph of President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose \"war on poverty\" agenda in the mid 1960s was known as the Great Society. Superimposed on Johnson\u2019s image is the following text: \"Black children born without a father in the home rate pre-LBJ's 'Great Society' welfare system in 1964: 7 percent. Black children born without a father in the home rate post-LBJ's 'Great Society' 2014 = 73 percent. Hey, liberals, how's your 'Great Society' working out for the black family?\" We wanted to know if the meme\u2019s numbers were right: Did the percentage of black children born without a father in the home rise from 7 percent before the Great Society to 73 percent today, and was it due to Johnson and the Great Society? As we researched this claim, we noticed a problem: There is no federal data on \"black children born without a father in the home.\" Instead, we found two types of data that are similar -- but not a perfect fit. One is unmarried black births as a percentage of all black births. The other is the percentage of black children living without a father in the home. The first option addresses births, a key focus of the Facebook claim. But this figure ignores cases in which a couple isn\u2019t married, but where the father is living in the home. The second option, by contrast, does address living arrangements, but it includes all children up to age 18, not those who were \"born\" that year. So to be as complete as possible, we\u2019ll analyze both statistics here. Unmarried black births as a percentage of all black births In 1964, according to federal health statistics, 24.6 percent of births to non-whites were considered \"illegitimate,\" the term used for out-of-wedlock births at the time. In 2012, the percentage of black births that were made to unmarried black mothers was 72 percent. This is a large increase, and the more recent figure is more or less on target. However, the starting point in 1964 is higher than the Facebook post suggests. So the overall increase is more limited than the meme says. (Note: The 1964 figure was based on the \"non-white\" population, a category that includes Hispanics and Asian-Americans, while the 2012 figure was for African Americans only.) So if you use this measurement, the meme\u2019s numbers are off. The percentage of black children living without a father in the home These figures offer even less support for the Facebook claim. According to Census Bureau data, about 20 percent of black children in 1960 were living with just a mother. The comparable figure for 2013 is 50 percent of black children living with a mother only. (The only pre-Great Society year for which data is available is 1960.) So this measurement, too, shows an increase. But the increase is two-and-a-half times bigger, not 10 times bigger, as the meme says, and it\u2019s up by 25 to 30 percentage points, rather than the 66 points cited in the meme. When we checked with experts, we found additional problems of context and logic with the claim. Here are a few of them: Black families weren\u2019t the only group to see an increase in single motherhood over the same time period Rates of fatherlessness for whites have always been lower than for blacks, but fatherlessness among whites still rose between 1960 and 2012. Six percent of white children lived in a single-mother household in 1960, a figure that rose to 18 percent in 2013. That\u2019s a tripling, which was proportionately an even bigger percentage increase than what was observed for black children. We don\u2019t really know how common black single parenthood was prior to the Great Society Douglas J. Besharov, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland, said the official data on black marriage from the early- to mid-20th century is unreliable. It was not uncommon, he said, for black mothers to tell survey-takers that they were separated, when in fact they had never been married, he said. The data for white women is similarly misleading, since many young white women got married as teens and divorced a few years later -- a \"shotgun wedding\" pattern that doesn\u2019t suggest long-term stability for children. This pattern would mean that the frequency of non-marital births among African-Americans may have been higher than what the early 1960s statistics officially indicated, and the white rate of non-marital births may have been artificially low. \"Welfare\" -- the implicit target of the meme -- existed well before the Great Society The welfare rules of the 1960s may have imposed a \"marriage penalty\" on recipients -- benefits that could be earned as a single person would disappear once a recipient got married. But such a pattern should have become evident well before the Great Society. \" \u2018Welfare\u2019 was part of the New Deal in the 1930s,\" said Timothy M. Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin. \"It was designed for widows with kids who didn\u2019t qualify for Social Security, but it soon became a single-parent program for divorcees and later unmarried mothers.\" Correlation does not equal causation Just because rates of fatherlessness rose after Johnson and the Great Society doesn\u2019t mean they caused the increase. Lots of other factors were at play. Besharov said the focus on Johnson is off-base. He said that the broader social currents of 1960s \"liberalization\" -- more permissive sexual mores, easier divorce laws and greater financial independence due to rising rates of female employment, for instance -- did play a role in higher rates of single-motherhood for all races, but \"if you define \u2018the Great Society\u2019 as the things Johnson did, then there was very little impact\" on single motherhood rates."

However, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that Davis received more money from teacher unions than her predecessors, and therefore the claim is accurate.\n\nIt is important to note that the chart included in the tweet does not provide a complete picture of the contributions made by teacher groups to each candidate. Other factors, such as the timing and purpose of the contributions, are not taken into account in the analysis. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because it acknowledges that there may be additional information that could affect the accuracy of the claim.",
    "doc": "Teacher groups often back Democrats for office; it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise Wendy Davis has such support. Still, a reader asked us to check an April 11, 2014, tweet from @WendyDavisTruth, a Twitter account run by the Republican Party of Texas. The tweet said, \"Wendy Davis has already taken more $ from teacher unions than the past 3 Democrat gubernatorial candidates combined.\" The tweet came with a bar chart comparing contributions by three teacher groups \u2014 the Texas State Teachers Association, Texas chapter of the American Federation of Teachers and the political arm of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association. The bar labeled \"2014 Wendy Davis\" far exceeded comparable bars for Tony Sanchez\u2019s 2002 gubernatorial run, Chris Bell\u2019s 2006 campaign and Bill White\u2019s 2010 campaign. Here\u2019s the chart: By the group\u2019s math, Davis has drawn $102,777 from the three teacher groups, while the previous three Democratic nominees for governor combined to attract $102,700. Republican Party of Texa administrator Beth Cubriel told us by email the figures were based on contribution and expenditure reports filed at the Texas Ethics Commission. She added that the figures reflect all contributions by the teacher groups to the candidates \u2014 not just contributions made while each one was running for governor. But labels on the chart \u2014 \"2006 Bell\" and \"2014 Wendy Davis,\" for example \u2014 left us with a different impression. One might not expect that previous campaigns for other offices would be included in those contribution totals. We looked next at how much each candidate drew from the singled-out groups while running for governor. By our calculations, Davis garnered about $67,000 of her contributions from the groups for her two tightly-contested Senate campaigns with about $36,000 coming in since she declared for governor Oct. 3, 2013. Likewise, Bell in 2006 drew no donations from the groups during his run for governor; his nearly $40,000 came during his 2008 campaign for a Texas Senate seat. By contrast, the teacher contributions to Sanchez in 2002 and White in 2010 were specifically for gubernatorial campaigns. By email, Cubriel said our breakdown succinctly covers \"what didn't fit into the four corners\" of the party's chart. The party \"never claimed the money was given to her gov(ernor) campaign directly,\" she said. \"The years on the chart are to serve as a reminder of when each candidate was the nominee.\" We told Cubriel that our review of campaign-finance reports turned up a sizable contribution not included in the party\u2019s critique--$125,000 gained by Davis\u2019s gubernatorial kitty on Jan. 15, 2014, from the Washington, D.C.-based American Federation of Teachers Committee on Political Education. Cubriel said by phone that party researchers didn\u2019t search records for that group. \"That makes the case against her even worse,\" she said."

    "justification": "Based on the provided evidence, it can be concluded that Donna Campbell's position on taxation is inconsistent and open to interpretation. While she has signed pledges disavowing higher taxes and has expressed support for phasing out property taxes in favor of an existing sales tax, there is no direct evidence of her advocating for a 35% sales tax rate extension to medicine, groceries, real estate, and other essential items.\n\nThe closest evidence to support this claim can be found in a KVUE-TV news story from 2010, where Campbell is quoted as saying that income taxes and payroll taxes should be replaced with a 23% federal sales tax on consumer goods and services. However, it's important to note that this quote does not explicitly mention extending the sales tax rate to specific items like medicine, groceries, and real estate.\n\nMoreover, Campbell's campaign website and public statements do not reflect any support for a 35% state-federal-local sales tax rate extension.

    "doc": "State Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio says his opponent in a July 31, 2012, Republican primary runoff has a hankering to hike taxes.A Wentworth campaign mailer tells residents of the Austin-to-San Antonio Senate district: \"Don\u2019t be tricked: Donna Campbell,\" his New Braunfels runoff opponent, \"is pushing a 35% national-state-local sales tax on medicine, healthcare, groceries, water and real estate!\" Another Wentworth mailer presents her as saying: \"Texas needs a 35% sales tax on groceries, medicine, healthcare, water and ALL purchases.\" And a July 18, 2012, news article in the San Marcos Daily Record quotes Wentworth as saying: \"My opponent's call for a 35 percent sales tax in Texas on medicine, groceries, water, real estate and all purchases is absurd.\"A refresher: The existing state sales tax of 6.25 percent applies to retail sales, leases and rentals of most goods plus 17 categories of taxable services including Internet access and security services. Also, Texas cities, counties, transit authorities and special-purpose districts have the option of imposing an additional local sales tax for a combined total of state and local taxes of 8.25 percent. Many items -- including water, groceries and medicine -- are exempted from the sales tax.So, Wentworth is saying that Campbell both wants to more than quintuple the state sales tax rate and start applying the tax to some essential items.One hitch for us in starting this fact-check was the absence of any public sign that Campbell has been campaigning for a 35 percent state-federal-local sales tax. Any such proposal goes unmentioned on her campaign website, where she says she will work to decrease taxation.Asked how Wentworth unearthed his opponent\u2019s double-digit tax-hike push, Wentworth\u2019s consultant, Bryan Eppstein, pointed out that while Campbell was running for the U.S. House in 2010, Austin\u2019s KVUE-TV quoted her as advocating the replacement of federal income taxes with a 23 percent federal sales tax on consumer goods and services, a position then pointed out by her Democratic opponent, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett.An online version of the Oct. 29, 2010, KVUE news story quotes Campbell as saying: \"Income tax, payroll tax, you wouldn\u2019t pay any of that\" under the approach. \"If it\u2019s a retail tax, and you buy something new you\u2019d pay 23 percent,\" she said.Eppstein further pointed out that an official with the right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation, Talmadge Heflin, testified afresh in May 2012 in favor of the state wiping out property taxes and making up the lost revenue with changes in the sales tax. He said that based on Heflin\u2019s testimony, Wentworth concluded that Campbell favors a state sales tax rate of 12 percent.Heflin, a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, hearkened in his testimony to an April 2009 foundation report stating that revenue generated by property taxes could be replaced by money raised from the sales tax by setting the rate at 12.5 percent if the existing tax is extended to property sales or, he said, 9 percent if the tax is extended to property sales as well as all services that are taxed in at least one other state. The report says that if the sales tax is not expanded to additional items or services, its rate would need to be around 14.5 percent to raise revenues lost by eliminating property taxes statewide.Eppstein also noted that Campbell has the endorsement of Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, a group that asked candidates seeking its support to fill out its 2012 candidate questionnaire, including questions about phasing out property taxes in return for raising sales taxes.One question on the survey refers to \"end-user consumption taxes,\" meaning sales taxes. The questions says: \"Would you support moving Texas away from property taxes in favor of the existing sales and use tax?\" Candidates are asked to support or oppose. The question is followed by this text: \"Note: Tax swaps, phase-outs or trade-offs are not considered tax increases unless the total tax burden is increased.\"Next on the questionnaire: \"Statement: Texas should phase out property taxes in favor of end-user consumption taxes.\" Candidates are asked to agree or disagree.By email, Campbell spokesman Jon Oliver said that Campbell replied on the questionnaire that she supports moving Texas away from property taxes to the existing sales tax and also agreed that Texas should phase out property taxes in favor of end-user consumption taxes.But, Oliver said, in order to have Campbell\u2019s support, a proposal to replace property taxes with sales taxes would have to lower the overall tax burden for Texas families and businesses; be limited to taxing items currently covered by the sales tax; be phased in gradually; and win voter approval at the polls.Earlier, Oliver said by email: \"She is intrigued by the overall idea of a consumption tax instead of a property tax if it would truly lower the tax burden, but it's not part of her platform and she certainly wouldn't support a state sales tax in the form Sen.Wentworth has claimed she would -- that is, taxing items that are currently exempt.\"Oliver noted, too, that Campbell has signed three pledges disavowing higher taxes: the Americans for Prosperity Taxpayer Pledge in favor of requiring voter or legislative supermajority approval for tax and spending increases; Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s \"budget compact\" pledge to oppose any new taxes or tax increase; and one to taxpayers, advocated by Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, stating she \"will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes.\"We circled back to Eppstein, asking for evidence of Campbell talking up a 35-percent sales tax. By telephone, Eppstein said he has heard Campbell indicate as much, but did not record it."

    "claim": "The health care law \"adds around $800 billion of taxes on the American people. It does not discriminate between rich and poor.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim made by Senator Marco Rubio that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) adds around $800 billion of taxes on the American people and does not discriminate between rich and poor is false. The evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim in several ways.\n\nFirstly, the report commissioned by Republican House Speaker John Boehner to estimate the cost of repealing the healthcare law found that repealing it would result in $813 billion in lost revenues for the government between 2012 and 2021. This suggests that the ACA actually generates revenue for the government, rather than adding taxes.\n\nSecondly, the article explains that the ACA creates several new revenue sources, including a tax penalty for people who do not have health insurance and a tax on indoor tanning. However, these taxes are not simply added onto existing taxes without any deductions or credits. The law also provides tax credits to low- and moderate-income families, which would reduce the amount of taxes they owe. Therefore, it is important to subtract these tax credits and subsidies when calculating the net \"tax increase\" over 10 years, as suggested by Chapin White, a former CBO staffer. According to White, the more appropriate net tax increase over 10 years is around $20 billion, rather than $800 billion as claimed by Rubio.\n\nThirdly, the article notes that the ACA's individual mandate requires most everyone to have health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service. While it is true that the penalty is linked to income, the nonpartisan federal researchers at CBO and JCT have estimated that around 4 million uninsured Americans, including dependents, will have to pay up in 2016, amounting to $4 billion in revenue per year from 2017 to 2019. This suggests that the mandate does not solely burden the wealthy with taxes, as Rubio claimed.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that Senator Marco Rubio's claim that the ACA adds around $800 billion of taxes on the American people and does not discriminate between rich and poor is false. The law actually generates revenue for the government, provides tax credits to low- and moderate-income families, and does not solely burden the wealthy with taxes. Therefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "It\u2019s not news that Republicans predict the health care overhaul will spell devastation for business. But Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is taking it further. He warns the law will \"hurt everyone.\"\"Obamacare is bad policy that adds around $800 billion of taxes on the American people,\" he wrote in a July 8 opinion-editorial in the Orlando Sentinel. \"It does not discriminate between rich and poor. It hurts everyone.\"We wondered where he got his $800 billion tax total, as well as the validity of the idea that the law does not \"discriminate between rich and poor.\" So we decided to check it out.$800 billion in new taxes?Rubio pulled the figure from a 2011 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Office and Joint Committee on Taxation. It was commissioned by Republican House Speaker John Boehner to estimate the cost of repealing the health care law.Repealing the law would result in $813 billion in lost revenues for the government between 2012 and 2021, the report found.Where do those come from? To pay for the overhaul, the federal government created a series of new revenue sources -- some are clearly taxes, some are changes to tax rules -- that include the controversial tax penalty for people who do not have their own health insurance and a tax on indoor tanning. (We looked at more than a dozen revenue sources and whether they were actually taxes in a January PolitiFact report.)Whether each revenue source is technically a tax does not matter to Rubio. Here, he equates all money raised from Americans as a tax.Also, Rubio\u2019s number doesn\u2019t account for the tax breaks that are in the law, especially the tax credits that some people of modest means will receive to help them buy insurance.We consulted several experts, who disagreed on the best way to account for the law\u2019s tax increases.A couple experts said Rubio\u2019s $800 billion figure is valid, even if it is out of date and does not account for billions in tax credits.\"It's just stating what the tax bill is,\" said Joseph Henchman, of the business-backed Tax Policy Foundation. \"Most people don't expect you to net out benefits.\"Not so fast, said Chapin White, a former CBO staffer who is now a senior health researcher at the Center for Studying Health System Change, a health research group founded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. White said it\u2019s important to subtract the law\u2019s $519 billion in refundable tax credits and subsidies for health insurance, among other things.All told, the more appropriate net \"tax increase\" over 10 years is about $20 billion, he said.No difference between rich and poor?Rubio spokesman Alex Conant declined to elaborate on what Rubio meant when he said the law does not \"discriminate between rich and poor,\" saying he did not want to parse his words.The best we can infer from Rubio\u2019s claim and the context around it is the health care law affects the rich and the poor the same, tax-wise.And that\u2019s off base.The point of the law was to expand health coverage to those who don\u2019t have it -- including people who don't have jobs or have low income. To make that happen, the law provides tax credits to low- and moderate-income families, and it includes more taxes on the wealthy and an individual mandate requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance.Two of the biggest taxes in the law are geared toward taxpayers with higher incomes. People whose incomes exceed $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly) will pay 0.9 percentage point more on Medicare payroll taxes in 2013. These people would also pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. Plus, the law includes a 40 percent excise tax on people who have high-premium health insurance plans starting in 2018. Also known as \"Cadillac plans,\" these premiums are usually obtained by people in the middle- to upper- class, and are expected to bring in $111 billion through 2021.Democrats, of course, take a different view than the Republicans. The Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate Finance Committee released a compilation of tax breaks available to individuals, middle-class families, and small businesses, thanks to the law. The total? $828 billion in \"tax cuts\" over 10 years.Most of that comes from tax credits and subsidies for families with low- to moderate-level incomes. The law creates exchanges through which consumers can shop for the best plans. People who qualify can supplement the cost of an insurance plan with a government subsidy, which will be based on income.A break is also extended to certain small businesses with low-income workers who employ fewer than 50 people and offer health insurance to them.Now for the individual mandate, which requires most everyone to have health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service.You could argue it doesn\u2019t discriminate between rich and poor because it applies to most everyone. But the penalty is linked to income.Individuals who go uninsured and who aren't exempt from the mandate will have to pay an annual penalty of at least $95 per adult in 2014, rising to $325 in 2015 and $695 in 2016. After 2016, the amount would be indexed to inflation and could be higher -- 2.5 percent of household income, if that\u2019s greater than the amount written into the law.The nonpartisan federal researchers at CBO and JCT have estimated that about 4 million uninsured Americans, including dependents, will have to pay up in 2016, amounting to $4 billion in revenue per year from 2017 to 2019.Probably most relevant to our fact-check is the fact that the mandate includes a hardship exemption for people who cannot afford to buy health insurance."

    "doc": "Florida\u2019s effort to search for noncitizens on the voter rolls launched a firestorm in the weeks leading up to the 2012 presidential election. Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s initiative was lampooned on The Daily Show; the U.S. Department of Justice cried foul; and two South Florida congressmen held a presser to tout errors on the list, including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet flagged as potentially not being a citizen. But in the end, just how many noncitizen voters did Florida find among almost 12 million voters? Former Gov. Charlie Crist gave his answer in a speech to Louisiana Democrats on Aug. 17, 2013. He started by bashing the state\u2019s recent announcement that it intends to scrutinize the voter rolls for noncitizens yet again. \"Our governor just announced last week he is going to start a purge of voters in Florida,\" Crist said. \"They tried it last year. The secretary of state put together a list of over 100,000 people that they thought were ineligible to vote. Came out there were less than 10. I mean, what a joke. It\u2019s unconscionable what they will do to win these elections.\" Crist, a former Republican turned independent turned Democrat, is considering a bid against Scott. If Crist runs in 2014, one way he will try to boost turnout among Democrats and minorities is by hammering Scott\u2019s record on voting rights. So was he correct to say that the effort to get rid of noncitizen voters only led to \"less than 10\" being removed? 2012 efforts to purge voter rolls First, we\u2019ll briefly recap the history of the search for noncitizen voters. Shortly after Scott took office in 2011 he asked his top election official at the time to look into removing noncitizens from the voter rolls. By 2012, the Division of Elections put together a list of about 180,000 potential noncitizens based on driver\u2019s license data. The state whittled the list down to about 2,600 names and sent them to county election supervisors in April 2012. Liberal groups criticized the list that they said disproportionately targeted Hispanics and other minorities. Supervisors found all sorts of errors and would later use words such as \"sloppy\" and \"embarrassing\" to describe the state initiative. One of the problems was that the driver\u2019s license data doesn\u2019t get updated when a legal resident later becomes a citizen. By September 2012, the Division of Elections said it had confirmed 207 noncitizens on the voter rolls and that the names would be provided to county elections supervisors to contact the voters. Any that matched federal homeland security data would be removed. Later that month the state produced a new list of 198 potentially ineligible voters. But by then, supervisors were fed up with the timing and process, and the effort appeared to fizzle out. A year later, in August 2013, news broke that the state was about to launch another round of searching for noncitizens on the voter rolls. So what was the total removed? PolitiFact Florida asked the division of elections for the total number of noncitizens removed, including a breakdown by county, during 2012. The best figures we could obtain from the state only included those removed as of Aug. 1, 2012. We counted 85 who were listed as being removed because they were \"not a U.S. citizen.\" (A few additional voters on that list were removed for other reasons, such as being dead or moving out of state. One category for removal was \"request by voter,\" though it doesn\u2019t explain why the voters requested it.) As a back-stop, we next checked in directly with some of the county supervisors of elections to see how many noncitizen voters they removed from the rolls. Their answers made it clear it was more than 10. Miami-Dade: 16 voters removed. Collier: 36 removed. Broward: Seven voters removed. Orange: Seven voters removed. Lee: Six voters removed. Hillsborough: Two voters removed. Pasco: Two voters removed. Pinellas: Six voters removed. We asked Crist to explain how he arrived at his figure of \"less than 10.\" \"Just from news accounts, may have been around 40 or so actually,\" he responded in an email. \"And somewhat more purged.\" He sent us a copy of an August 2013 New York Times article about the state\u2019s renewed effort that stated: \"Ultimately, the list of possible noncitizen voters shrank to 198. Of those, fewer than 40 had voted illegally.\""

    "doc": "We don\u2019t know yet if the Ebola scare will help either party or be an afterthought in the midterm elections, but liberal blogger Doug Muder argued that confronting Ebola shows that it makes sense to vote Democratic. For Muder, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul is the poster child for a distinct partisan contrast. \"Ebola points out why we need a fully funded government,\" Muder wrote. \"When there\u2019s no immediate threat of disease, government agencies like the CDC look like bureaucratic waste. When Rand Paul put out a \u2018Tea Party budget\u2019 in 2011, it included a big cut in the CDC, and virtually no explanation as to how this would affect its mission.\" In this fact-check, we look at whether Paul proposed a \"big cut\" in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Muder had blogged about Paul\u2019s budget in 2011. Back then, Muder asked how the CDC would be able to fulfill its mission if, as Paul wanted, its budget was cut by $1.165 billion. We went back to Paul\u2019s original budget documents. One posted January 2011 called for the $1.165 billion reduction that Muder mentioned. Paul then assembled a more complete budget plan in May 2011. It would cut the CDC budget by 20 percent from its Fiscal Year 2008 levels. Depending on whether you include special funds to evaluate federal health programs, Congress appropriated between $6.049 billion and $6.375 billion for the CDC in FY 2008. So Rand\u2019s 20 percent reduction amounts to either $1.209 billion or $1.275 billion in cuts. That\u2019s slightly more than Muder described. Paul wrote in his plan, \"The center is often mentioned in media reports highlighting their lavish accommodations. For example, in 2005, the CDC built a conference center for $106 million, complete with large-screen plasma TVs. They also spent tens of millions of dollars on state-of-the-art anti-gravity seating for employees, as well as luxury furniture. Taxpayers can no longer afford the luxury working atmosphere of the CDC.\" That budget plan remains posted on the websiterandpaul2016.com, Paul's Senate re-election website. Brian Darling, a Paul spokesman, agreed that the senator has proposed these cuts in the past, but said that funding and the ability to fight Ebola don\u2019t inevitably go hand-in-hand. \"If you look closely at the CDC budget, there are funds that have been wasted on projects that have nothing to do with disease prevention,\" Darling said. Darlingthen noted that Congress has been at least as supportive of the CDC as the Obama administration. Darlingsaid that in an omnibus spending bill, Congress appropriated $6.9 billion for the CDC, about $240 million more than the administration requested. Darlinghighlighted another $88 million for Ebola in a continuing resolution bill approved in September. However, neither action undercuts Muder\u2019s point, and Paul voted against both measures. It\u2019s important to remember that those bills doled out money across many government agencies, not specifically for the CDC alone. Sometimes reasonable people can quibble over whether a cut is \"big\" or not. In this case, Paul himself called his cuts \"serious\"in a 2011 op-ed he penned for the Wall Street Journal. \"My proposal, not surprisingly, has been greeted skeptically in Washington, where serious spending cuts are a rarity,\" Paul wrote. \"But it is a modest proposal when measured against the size of our mounting debt.\""

    "doc": "As Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio edges closer to a 2016 presidential bid, he wants Republican primary voters to know where he stands on litmus test issues like climate change. \"I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate,\" Rubio said on ABC's This Week. \"I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it, except it will destroy our economy.\" Many Republican voters would nod in agreement, but the question is, how well does this view sit with the public at large? Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, said Rubio might be on relatively safe ground with the public. \"From 2004, 2005, 2006, Americans were bought in to the concept of climate change and that we need to move aggressively on it,\" Scarborough said. But since then, the public shifted, he said. \"Check the polling: Most Americans began wandering away from this issue,\" Scarborough said. From Scarborough\u2019s lips to our ears. In this fact-check, we review the polls on climate change and global warming (terms that are used interchangeably) to see if Americans care less than they did half a dozen years ago. Pollsters get at this question in a few ways. We\u2019ll look at each one. Is it happening? For nearly 15 years, the Gallup organization has been asking people if they think global warming is underway. In 2002, 71 percent of the public said it is happening or will happen in their lifetime. That percentage peaked at 75 percent in 2008 and then fell. It reached a low of 62 percent in 2011 and since then has risen slightly. As of March 2014, it stood at 65 percent. With a margin of error of 4 percent, the result is modestly less than what Gallup reported in 2002. We find similar but slightly larger swings of opinion in the Pew Research Center data, although the Pew survey only goes back to 2006. Pew asks if people see solid evidence that the earth is warming. In 2006, 77 percent said yes. That fell to 57 percent in 2009, then rose to 67 percent in 2013. The trends don't exactly match the pattern Scarborough described. He suggested a simple slide down. In reality, there\u2019s more of an up-down-up. Still, the public seems a little less certain about climate change today than in the mid 2000s. Is it something you worry about? Even if you believe the climate is changing, it might not cause you great concern. A group of university researchers from Drexel, McGill and Ohio State blended the results from a number of surveys to derive what they called the Climate Change Threat Index. Basically, the index captures whether people take the issue seriously. Robert Brulle, a sociologist at Drexel University, is part of the team. From 2002 to 2005, the value of the index fluctuated between 40 and 45. (These are abstract units and should not be confused with the percentage of people who care.) Then it gained about 10 points. \"The big shift started in 2006 and coincided with the release of Al Gore\u2019s movie An Inconvenient Truth,\" Brulle said. \"It dropped off in the fall of 2008 after the big recession and the Wall Street meltdown.\" Today, the index is about where is was in 2004. Again, up-down-up. Interestingly, Brulle and his colleagues Jason Carmichael and J. Craig Jenkins found that two factors primarily drive public concern about climate change. First, people worry more about it so long as more pressing problems like the economy don\u2019t loom larger. Second, Republicans effectively can dial concern up or down. The partisan split on this issue shows up in every survey. The more Republican the voter, the less likely they are to say climate change is real or that it will make a difference. When Republican leaders are more vocal in their rejection of climate change (such as voting against a particular bill), public concern falls, at least among Republican leaning voters. When those leaders treat it more seriously, concern rises. But do you worry about it a lot? Gallup gets at the level of concern by asking people if they think global warming will pose a serious threat to them or their way of life in their lifetime. In 2004, about 34 percent answered yes. That rose to 40 percent in 2008, then fell to a low of 32 percent in 2010. It then rose to 38 percent and slid a bit to 36 percent where it stands today. When you account for the margin of error, public opinion has yo-yoed a bit but hasn\u2019t changed all that much. Gallup finds that few American list climate change as a top concern. It ranked near the bottom out of 15 issues polled. Asked how much they worry, 51 percent said little or not at all about climate change, compared to just 11 percent who said they were unconcerned about the economy. Are humans causing it? In 2006, Pew found that 41 percent of public thought the Earth was getting warmer mainly due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels. In keeping with the pattern we saw for other questions, that number dropped to 34 percent in 2010, and then rose to 44 percent by the end of 2013. On this point, the partisan divide is pronounced. Just 24 percent of Republicans thought humans were driving climate change, compared to 43 percent of independents and 66 percent of Democrats. The Gallup polls show a similar pattern. In 2004, 61 percent thought humans were making the planet warmer. That fell to 50 percent in 2010, followed by a rise to 57 percent today. Again, the polling shows a slight decline in public buy-in on climate change since 2004, but it has risen from a low point a few years ago."

    "doc": "People die, but their Social Security numbers often linger on. So says U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who recently introduced a bill that would require the Social Security Administration to do a better job of tracking the departed to make sure their federal benefits don\u2019t survive. \"The SSA (Social Security Administration\u2019s) Office of the Inspector General reported last month that, according to the agency\u2019s own records, there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers who are 112 years of age or older,\" Warner said in an April 23 news release. That\u2019s more than twice the of population of Chicago -- filled with people at least 112. It\u2019s especially remarkable when you consider that the Gerontology Research Group says it knew of 42 people in the world who were alive last October at 112 or older. Fifteen of them lived in the U.S. The immortal Social Security numbers, Warner said, open avenues for fraudulent benefit claims. We wondered whether the senator\u2019s Social Security figures were correct. Warner\u2019s office pointed us to a March 4 report issued by Patrick O\u2019Carroll Jr., the Social Security Administration\u2019s inspector general. O\u2019Carroll testified about the agency\u2019s death records during a March 16 hearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. He stated that the agency maintains an electronic record on each person given a Social Security number and is supposed to update it when they die so their number can no longer be used. The agency gets its death information from a variety of sources, such as family members, funeral homes and financial institutions. It maintains a \"Death Master File\" with nearly 90 million electronic records that\u2019s shared with other federal agencies to prevent erroneous benefits and sold to credit reporting companies to guard against fraud. Sometimes the Social Security Administration prematurely declares people dead, as recently reported on CBS\u2019 60 Minutes, causing bureaucratic nightmares when those people try to open bank accounts or do myriad other things requiring a valid Social Security number. The agency\u2019s internal auditor found in 2008 that 20,000 people had been wrongly listed as dead. And sometimes the opposite is true, O'Carroll said in his testimony, and the agency fails to take away Social Security numbers from the dead -- even when the agency has been informed of the deaths. It all came to a head a few years ago when O'Carroll\u2019s office learned that a bank reported that a man had opened accounts using the Social Security numbers of two different people -- one born in 1886 and the other in 1893. The auditors did a little research and found that the world\u2019s oldest living man at the time was 112. So they chose the age as the entry point of their investigation. The auditors indeed found, as Warner claimed, that 6.5 million cardholders were listed in Social Security records as being at least 112. All but about 100,000 of the numbers were issued prior to 1972, when the agency started using electronic records. The good news is that the auditors found no instances of people illegally collecting Social Security through one of these old numbers. The bad news is that the potential for abuse is high and, according to the report, \"thousands\" of the numbers \"could have been used\" to commit other types of identity fraud. Auditors found that 66,920 of the numbers had been used by people for whom the government received wage reports from 2006 and 2011. One of the numbers appeared on 613 different wage reports. That means people were using the numbers in job applications and 3,873 of the numbers turned up in E-Verify inquiries, an Internet-based system that allows employers to determine whether potential hirees are entitled by immigration laws to work in the U.S. Final notes: If you\u2019re wondering, the verified oldest person in the world at this writing is Jeralean Talley of Michigan, whose 116th birthday is on May 23. The oldest man is Sakari Momoi of Japan, who turned 112 in February. The verified oldest person ever was Jeanne Calment of France, who died in 1997 at 122 years, 164 days old. The oldest man was Christian Mortensen of Denmark, who died in 1998 at 115 years, 252 days."

    "doc": "Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s plan to expand revenues for transportation includes a $15 increase in the state\u2019s car registration fee.\"Right now, $41 is our average registration. This will change it to $56,\" McDonnell said at a Jan. 8 news conference. \"This registration fee, even at an average $56, still puts us at a rate equal to or lower than most states in the country.\"We asked the governor\u2019s office to back up McDonnell\u2019s claim that, even with the 37 percent increase, Virginia\u2019s registration fee would compare equally or favorably to most states.Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for the governor, said it\u2019s difficult to get an apples-to-apples comparison of how Virginia\u2019s registration fee measures up to other states, because of differences among the states in how the those fees are assessed.\"However, when looking at the common vehicle fees that most states use, such as vehicle license fees (registration), title fees and title taxes (sales tax), Virginia is clearly one of the lowest in our region of the country even with the proposed $15 increase,\" Caldwell said in an e-mail.When comparing just registration fees, Caldwell said, Virginia\u2019s proposed new fee would still be lower than states such as Maryland, Wisconsin, Montana, Illinois, Oklahoma and Vermont.We note that McDonnell\u2019s statement compared registration fees to \"most states\" in the U.S. -- not one region or group of states. The governor\u2019s statement also specifically focused on the $41 average registration fee for a passenger car -- a standard registration cost that doesn\u2019t include the expense of getting a title or paying the sales tax.Given the narrow focus of McDonnell\u2019s statement, we looked at how Virginia\u2019s basic registration fee -- assessed annually at $40.75 for vehicles up to 4,000 pounds -- would compare to other states if it were increased by $15.As Caldwell wrote, it is difficult to get an apples-to-apples comparison among all 50 states. While Virginia and 25 other states levy a uniform registration fee for cars up to a certain weight, other states use an assortment of calculations that consider factors such as a vehicle\u2019s horsepower, selling price, weight and the year it was first registered.We examined a list of registration fees from the National Conference of State Legislatures and one compiled by the American Automobile Association.The lists show 28 other states have registration fees that are lower than the $56 annual charge McDonnell seeks for Virginia. These states either had a set rate that is lower than the proposed new fee in Virginia, or a formula that put the maximum charge for a 4,000-pound vehicles below $56.By contrast, only seven states would have higher registration fees than Virginia -- the six Caldwell mentioned in his email and Hawaii.We couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion on how Virginia\u2019s proposed new fee would compare to 14 other states because of variables in their formulas for computing registration costs. For example, New Jersey\u2019s fee ranges from $35.50 to $84 based on the age and weight of the car. South Dakota\u2019s fees range from $30 to $92, again based on how old the car is and how much it weighs while Louisiana\u2019s registration ranges from $20 to $82 based on a vehicle\u2019s selling price."

However, the evidence provided shows that the donations were made between 2005 and 2010, and that Session declined requests from taxi companies who wanted to latch on to the state's lawsuit in order to avoid the appearance of impropriety.\n\nFinally, the ad claims that Uber drivers lost their jobs \"overnight\" due to Cortez Masto's legal fight. However, the evidence provided notes that Uber claimed 1,000 drivers lost their jobs \"overnight,\" but provides no clear way to verify this figure.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that Catherine Cortez Masto drove Uber out of Nevada is overstated and misleading. While Cortez Masto did take legal action against Uber, the reality of the situation is more complicated and nuanced than the ad suggests. Therefore, the label CONFLICTING is appropriate.",
    "doc": "Catherine Cortez Masto is once again taking fire from a Koch Brothers-backed group attacking her record as the state\u2019s attorney general. Freedom Partners Action Fund is spending $1.2 million on a new television ad campaign accusing the Nevada Democratic Senate candidate of \"driving away jobs\" by forcibly shutting down popular ride-hailing company Uber in Nevada. \"Many Nevadans relied on Uber for work, but after accepting $70,000 from taxi companies, Catherine Cortez Masto went after Uber \u2014 once, twice, three times \u2014 until she drove them out of town, along with all their jobs,\" the ad says. Let\u2019s be clear \u2014 Uber has been operating in Nevada for about a year. But is it true that Cortez Masto pushed out Uber and drove away jobs in 2014? No free rides Uber didn\u2019t have the smoothest ride into Nevada. Speculation around the company launching was running rampant in 2014 as Uber eyed Nevada and tourist-friendly Las Vegas as one of the most lucrative markets without ride-hailing companies operating (Uber considered Nevada in 2012 but backed out). But Uber\u2019s normal strategy of legally questionable, high-profile launches was a more difficult bar to clear in Nevada, where the closely-regulated taxi market is ruled by incredibly strict regulations. The rules include an explicit prohibition in state law on any company entering the market unless it can prove it wouldn\u2019t \"adversely affect other carriers operating in the territory.\" Nevada also has a confusing regulatory structure for overseeing cab drivers. The Nevada Taxicab Authority oversees Las Vegas, while the Transportation Authority regulates the rest of the state. Both regulators fall under the Department of Business and Industry, which Director Bruce Breslow said attempted to negotiate Uber\u2019s entry into the market before it suddenly launched statewide on Oct. 24, 2014. \"In the middle of trying to help them, they decided to operate without authority and illegally at the time in Nevada,\" Breslow said. Despite being told by regulators that Uber would need to apply under existing rules for new taxi companies, the company argued its non-traditional business model didn\u2019t fall under decades-old state regulations. State officials disagreed, and quickly cracked down. Uber drivers caught by regulators were immediately cited and their cars impounded, and the Attorney General\u2019s office quickly filed suit to shut Uber down. In an interview, a spokesman for Freedom Partners said Cortez Masto\u2019s \"overaggressive legal fight\" justified the ad. \"The reality is that Uber was operating in the absence of regulations, not in spite of them, and the state Legislature ultimately codified what Nevadans already knew: Uber is not a taxi company and should not be subject to their regulations,\" spokesman Bill Riggs said in an email. So how much wiggle room did Cortez Masto have in going after Uber, and was her legal strategy as overzealous as the ad claims? Jurisdictional fights The ad claims Cortez Masto went after Uber \"three times\" until the company was driven out of the state \u2014 a reference to three attempted requests for temporary restraining orders filed on the same day Uber launched. The requests, which were filed in Carson City, Reno and Las Vegas, created a legal mess with several justices attempting to claim the case, including one Las Vegas-based justice suggesting that the Attorney General\u2019s office was \"jumping around to different jurisdictions trying to get a ruling.\" Nevada\u2019s state Supreme Court eventually ruled on the jurisdictional fight, sending the case to a Reno district court, which promptly granted an injunction against Uber (the company soon after \"temporarily suspended operations\"). Freedom Partners claims this \"overaggressive legal fight\" drove Uber out of the state and cost jobs, but the truth is more complicated. Former Chief Deputy Attorney General Gina Session oversaw the Uber case. She said the office filed in three courts because they were pressed for time and weren't totally sure if an injunction filed in one jurisdiction would apply statewide \u2014 especially because Nevada has two geographically-based regulatory bodies covering the taxi industry. (Uber launched unexpectedly on a Friday). Former Deputy Attorney General Colleen Platt said the rush to file the suits that Friday meant they weren\u2019t submitted with the usually required documentation, adding to the confusion. A panel of state Supreme Court justices called the multiple lawsuits an \"inept effort\" ignoring procedural rules, but didn\u2019t find any evidence proving the office was searching for a more favorable court (though one dissenting justice said it gave \"an appearance of improper forum shopping\"). Former Nevada Transportation Authority chairman Andrew MacKay said the massive size of Uber\u2019s workforce dwarfed the enforcement capabilities of state regulators, meaning the only real maneuver available was a court-ordered restraining order. MacKay, who disclosed that he\u2019s supporting Republican Joe Heck in the state\u2019s Senate race, detailed some of the issues with Uber in a three-page affidavit describing the more stringent requirements of Nevada\u2019s cab companies. Although Freedom Partners argues Uber\u2019s business model didn\u2019t fall under existing law, state regulators unanimously agreed that Uber met the definition of a \"common motor carrier\" and needed to follow the applicable laws. Legal discretion, wiggle room The ad raises the question of how much discretion Cortez Masto had in going after Uber, and how much of the \"blame\" she deserves. Session said the Attorney General\u2019s office generally serves as primary legal counsel for state agencies and departments, and that the actions taken against Uber fit Cortez Masto\u2019s approach to her job. \"This was generally the way our office operated,\" Session said. \"Unless our clients were asking us to do something that was clearly illegal, we followed the will of our clients.\" MacKay, chairman of the state\u2019s \"client\" in the case against Uber, said it\u2019s theoretically possible that Cortez Masto could have ignored the will of the state and not filed suit, but it would have been highly unusual. \"I couldn\u2019t foresee the AG or any AG not enforcing state law,\" MacKay said. There are several high-profile examples of Cortez Masto\u2019s discretion in which cases to take, twice determining not to follow through on requests from Republican governors on politically-charged issues. Freedom Partners also linked to a similar situation in Virginia that was resolved more peacefully. Donations & job losses As for the ad\u2019s reference to $72,626 from taxi donations, Freedom Partners provided PolitiFact with a spreadsheet of taxi company donations to Cortez Masto between 2005 and 2010. PolitiFact double-checked the numbers and found them to be accurate, though close to $26,000 were \"in-kind\" donations which went to reserving billboard ads. Session did say she declined requests from taxi companies who wanted to latch on to the state\u2019s lawsuit in order to avoid the appearance that they were doing the taxi industry\u2019s bidding. As for the job losses, Uber at the time claimed that roughly 1,000 drivers lost their jobs \"overnight\" due to the state\u2019s legal fight, though there\u2019s no clear way to double check that figure. Regardless, Uber hired an army of lobbyists in 2015 and pushed through legislation allowing so-called \"Transportation Network Companies\" to legally operate in the state, roughly a year after the initial legal skirmishes."

    "doc": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump raised eyebrows during a recent rally when he offered a counterinsurgency parable from more than a century ago that featured United States Army Gen. John Joseph \"Black Jack\" Pershing. During a Feb. 19, 2016, rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump referred to an anecdote from the aftermath of the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902, when the United States sought to exert its authority over the Asian archipelago, which it had recently obtained from Spain after winning the Spanish-American War. Help PolitiFactraise $15,000 to hire a fact-checkerto cover the immigration debate. After taking the reins of power from Spain, the United States faced armed opposition, and the three-year war led to the deaths of more than 4,200 American combatants, more than 20,000 Filipino combatants, and as many as 200,000 Filipino civilians, according to the State Department. After the war, Pershing served as governor of the heavily Muslim Moro Province between 1909 and 1913. This period was notable for its continuing insurgencies. \"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do,\" Trump said, according to an account in the Washington Post. \"And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs\u2019 blood \u2014 you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs\u2019 blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn\u2019t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn\u2019t a problem.\" After Trump told this story, critics called it apocryphal, misleading or outright false. Our friends at Snopes.com considered the evidence and called it a \"legend.\" We decided to check with historians of the period to see what they thought of the story. We heard back from eight scholars. Most expressed skepticism that the specific story ever happened, and many added that Trump\u2019s takeaway is wrong-headed. We\u2019ll take a look at those two concerns separately below. Did it happen? The idea that pig\u2019s blood could serve as a weapon against Muslims has been around in popular culture for decades. For instance, a 1939 Hollywood movie, The Real Glory, stars Gary Cooper as a doctor on the Philippine island of Mindanao who drapes a captive in pigskin \"to serve as an abject lesson to all would-be attackers,\" Luis H. Francia, a Filipino-born professor of Asian American Studies at Hunter College, wrote recently. Snopes has been tracking Internet-based rumors of this sort since 2001, and a California National Guard facility removed a poster telling the Pershing story in 2005. But the only historical evidence that something like this actually happened appears to come from a letter written by a soldier who served in the Philippines. \"Mr. C.C. Booth of Dallas, Texas, who served in Mindanao under Pershing, recalls seeing him hang a Moro chieftain by the heels over an open grave, kill a pig, and then drop the Moro into the grave with the bloody animal,\" according to a 1962 article by Donald Smythe in the Pacific Historical Review, an academic journal. However, David J. Silbey, a Cornell University historian and author of A War of Frontier and Empire: The Philippine-American War, 1899-1902, raised red flags about its sourcing. This claim came from one letter -- and one that was written in 1960, more than half a century after the events in question. (And for the sake of this fact-check, the details differ significantly from the story Trump told.) Other historians agreed that the evidence is thin, to say the least. \"This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,\" said Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940. \"I am amazed it is still making the rounds.\" Christopher Einolf, a professor at DePaul University and author of America in the Philippines, 1899-1902: The First Torture Scandal, added that he trusted the conclusion of the late military historian Frank E. Vandiver, who told About.com in 2003 that \"I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences. This kind of thing would have run completely against his character.\" Indeed, other historians noted that Pershing pursued a less brutal approach to \"pacifying\" the rebels in the southern Philippines than Leonard Wood, one of his predecessors. \"He did a lot of what we would call \u2018winning hearts and minds\u2019 and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance,\" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. \"He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn\u2019t negotiate with him. He wasn\u2019t solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply.\" Another wrinkle: Historians said the premise that the rebels would have been motivated by a fear of pigs is not as certain as Trump suggests. It\u2019s unclear how religiously observant the insurgents were and whether such a policy would have made a difference in their actions. \"The Moros were fighting for a lot of reasons, not just because they were Muslims,\" Janda said. \"This is another fact that gets lost in many modern discussions of terrorism.\" Facts aside, Trump\u2019s larger point is wrong To many of the historians we checked with, the idea that Pershing\u2019s hypothetical blood-dipped bullets pacified \"terrorists\" is actually the bigger problem with Trump\u2019s parable. \"Even if the tale is true, the pacifying effect that Trump claims is nonsense,\" said Michael H. Hunt, an emeritus historian at the University of North Carolina and author of Arc of Empire: America's Wars in Asia from the Philippines to Vietnam. The region \"remained in constant unrest during the period of American rule and into the period of independence, right down to the present.\" Silbey of Cornell agreed. \"Where Trump\u2019s remark becomes ridiculous is in the idea that this actually worked,\" he said. \"The Moro War did not end until 1913, and even that\u2019s a bit of a soft date, with violence continuing for quite a while afterward. Defilement by pig\u2019s blood isn\u2019t -- and wasn\u2019t -- some magical method of ending terrorism.\" If anything, a more complete account of the Moro insurgency involves some subplots that run contrary to Trump\u2019s narrative. \"The Ottomans under Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent a letter to the Sulu Moros asking them not to resist the Americans at the start of the Moro Rebellion, and the Moros on Sulu complied,\" Janda said. \"It\u2019s a nice example of diplomacy working to our advantage, and a reminder that then and now, not all Muslims or Moros are the same and that many were and are U.S. allies.\""

This suggests that the reasons for the outward migration are beyond the control of any one governor, including Glenn Youngkin and Terry McAuliffe.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it is reasonable to conclude that more Virginians are moving away from Virginia than moving in from other states, which supports the label \"True.\"",
    "doc": "Republican gubernatorial nominee Glenn Youngkin says recent Democratic governors have pushed Virginia into economic decline and people are moving out. \"Over the last few years, more Virginians are moving away from Virginia than are moving to Virginia from the other 49 states,\" he said during a May 21 interview on WRVA radio in Richmond. Youngkin holds two Democrats responsible: Current Gov. Ralph Northam and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who led the state from 2014-2018 and is Youngkin\u2019s opponent this year. Virginia is the only state that bars governors from serving successive terms. We fact-checked Youngkin\u2019s talking-point claim that more people are leaving Virginia than coming in and found it to be correct, although the reasons for the outward migration go far beyond any governor\u2019s control. The numbers The Internal Revenue Service publishes annual statistics on the number of households that moved and filed federal tax returns from a different state than the one in which they lived the previous year. Demographers and economists use these figures to track the \"net migration\" of families in the U.S. from year to year. The data show that from 1991 through 2012, Virginia always had more households coming in than going out. That changed in 2013, when there was a net loss of 4,270 households. Virginia had fewer filing households in each of the next five years - an average annual loss of 5,600 families. In 2018, the last year for which figures are available, Virginia lost a net of 4,707 households. This doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s been a massive flow out of Virginia. To give some perspective, about 4 million Virginia households annually file federal taxes. The net losses to other states in 2018 came to less than one-eighth of 1% of households. The U.S. Census Bureau also tracks net migration. It estimates that Virginia lost a net 11,994 people through domestic migration during the 12-month period that ended July 1, 2019. The reasons Jobs were the main reason people left Virginia for other states at the start of the last decade. That switched to the rising cost of living at the end of the decade, according to economic and demographic studies. Virginia is home to large military bases, and a fleet of defense and government contractors and federal workers that drive the state\u2019s economic engine in Northern Virginia. The region was hurt by sequestration programs beginning in 2013 that automatically cut defense and domestic spending when Congress could not agree on a budget. The result was that many Virginians whose paychecks were dependent on federal spending, particularly for defense, left the state to find new jobs, according to a 2016 report by Old Dominion University. More recently, the migration has been mainly triggered by people escaping the high cost of living in Northern Virginia, according to Hamilton Lombard, a demographer at the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia. They are largely young professionals seeking to buy first homes and raise families. Many are heading South to growing regions in North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Texas. Lombard also said that Virginia is losing retirees, mostly to Southern states. Youngkin blames the migration losses on McAuliffe and Northam.He prefaced his claim by saying he is \"frustrated with what the Democratic leadership had done to Virginia over eight years.\" But Lombard said the governors have had little control over the economic trends that have caused losses. \"Think of the cost of housing; the state has little control of that,\" he said. \"If you could point to anything that could have been done on the state level over the years, maybe it could have focused on making more of Virginia (economically) competitive outside Northern Virginia,\" Lombard said."

This supports Booker's claim that a \"mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders\" occurred between 1990 and 2005.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is accurate to label Senator Booker's claim as \"True\".",
    "doc": "With criminal justice reform in the national spotlight, first-term Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., commented on the growth of the prison system in recent years. \"We built a new prison every 10 days between 1990 and 2005 to keep up with our mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders,\" Booker said in a post to his Instagram account on July 27, 2015. Before joining the Senate, Booker served as mayor of Newark. Is Booker\u2019s claim correct? We decided to check. Prison growth, 1990-2005 We\u2019ll start by evaluating the first part of Booker\u2019s claim about a new prison being built on a near weekly basis between 1990 and 2005. Booker\u2019s communications director, Jeff Giertz, pointed to an almost identical quote in Bryan Stevenson\u2019s book, Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption, published in 2014. Stevenson is a law professor at New York University School of Law and executive director of a nonprofit group in Montgomery, Ala., called the Equal Justice Initiative. \"Between 1990 and 2005 a new prison opened in the United States every 10 days,\" Stevenson wrote. Neither Booker\u2019s nor Stevenson\u2019s statements specify state or federal prisons, but if we assume they are referring to both types of prisons, then data and an expert we contacted largely corroborate this claim. According to a Congressional Research Service report, \"the number of state and federal adult correctional facilities rose from 1,277 in 1990 to 1,821 in 2005, a 43% increase.\" That\u2019s an increase of 544 new facilities. There are 5,478 days in a 15-year span, which works out to almost exactly one facility every 10 days on average. John Pfaff, a professor at Fordham Law School specializing criminal justice and the recent boom in mass incarceration, said Booker\u2019s claim is correct if it includes both types of prisons. Pflaff said Booker is actually underselling the statistic by not going back to 1984. Between 1984 and 2005, the number of facilities grew by about one every 8.5 days. That said, Booker\u2019s time frame makes some sense because \"crime began to drop in 1991,\" and 2005 is the latest available year from the Bureau of Justice Statistics\u2019 Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities. Mass incarceration of nonviolent offenders The second part of Booker\u2019s claim is somewhat less clear. Grietz of Booker\u2019s staff pointed to data that showed the total number of nonviolent offenders incarcerated between 1980 and 2013 grew from 122,000 to 607,000 in 2013 -- a 400 percent increase, compared to a 300 percent increase of incarcerated violent offenders. But for the specific period discussed in Booker\u2019s Instagram post, the data runs counter to his point. Pfaff pointed to data gathered by a study in the Harvard Journal on Legislation that shows violent offenders contributed 60 percent to state prison growth between 1990 and 2009, while nonviolent offenders (drug and property offenses combined) contributed only 27 percent. Pfaff also added that the universe of state inmates is much larger than the pool of federal inmates. All told, 86 percent of prisoners are in state systems while only 14 percent are in the federal system. As it turns out, the big increase happened earlier. The data shows that 55 percent of state inmate growth came from nonviolent offenders between 1980 and 1990, before declining to 27 percent between 1990 and 2009. So Booker is wrong to focus on the period 1990 to 2005 when discussing a \"mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders.\" A big rise did occur, but it started earlier than Booker\u2019s post indicated. Finally, we\u2019ll note that in the much smaller universe of federal inmates, 76 percent and 72 percent of those sentenced to federal prison were sentenced for nonviolent offenses, according to U.S. Sentencing Commission data for 2012 and 2013."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label the claim \"Under Donald Trump's tax plan, 51 percent of single parents would see their taxes go up\" as True. The evidence from the Tax Policy Center and Forbes supports this conclusion.\n\nFirstly, the analysis by New York University professor Lily Batchelder shows that about 20 percent of households and more than half of single parents would pay more in federal taxes under Trump's plan. This is due to the repeal of personal exemptions and head of household filing status, which disproportionately affect single parents. For example, a single mother with one child can no longer deduct $9,350 in standard deductions and two $4,050 exemptions under Trump's plan, resulting in an additional $2,450 in income taxes.\n\nSecondly, the Tax Foundation's director of federal projects, Kyle Pomerleau, found no faults with Batchelder's report and replicated many of the numbers. This suggests that the analysis is reliable and supports the conclusion that single parents would see an increase in taxes under Trump's plan.\n\nFinally, the Clinton campaign's reference to the Tax Policy Center's analysis provides additional support for the claim. The center's report found that under Trump's plan, a single parent with an income of $75,000 and two school-age children would see their taxes increase by $2,440, while a single parent making $50,000 with three children would face an increase of $1,188.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is reasonable to conclude that 51 percent of single parents would see their taxes go up under Donald Trump's tax plan. Therefore, the label True is appropriate.",
    "doc": "Campaigning in the final stretch of the presidential election, Hillary Clinton took a brief break from knocking Donald Trump\u2019s character to hammerhis tax plan. \"He's taking care of himself, he's taking care of his family, he's taking care of the super wealthy and corporations,\" Clinton said at a rally in Pittsburgh on Nov. 4, 2016, adding that under Trump, \"51 percent of single parents would see their taxes go up.\" Briefly, Trump\u2019s tax plan would collapse the seven federal income tax brackets into three (12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent). He would also raise the standard deduction (the amount everyone can deduct from taxable income) but repeal personal exemptions and head of household filing status. Tax analysts have found that Trump\u2019s plan would deliver, on average, tax cuts across all income brackets. So how is it possible that single parents would pay more? The Clinton campaign referred us to analysis of Trump\u2019s tax plan fromthe Tax Policy Center, which is affiliated with the left-leaning Urban Institute. According to the report, authored by New York University professor Lily Batchelder, about 20 percent of households and more than half of single parents would wind up paying more in federal taxes. How? First, Trump\u2019s proposal to increase the standard deduction wouldn\u2019t be enough to offset the amount many single parents could have deducted with personal exemptions (which Trump would take away). For example, a single mother with one child can take a $9,350 standard deduction and two $4,050 exemptions, one for herself and one for her child in 2017 under the current system \u2014 or $17,450 in exemptions in total. Under Trump\u2019s plan, she would be able to take just a $15,000 standard deduction. The end result? That mother would have to pay income tax on an additional $2,450 under Trump\u2019s plan. Second, the head of household filing status currently applies to unmarried filers with dependents, and their standard deduction and tax rates are between those ofmarried filers and single filers. Repealing this provision as Trump proposes would require single parents to file as individuals with higher tax rates. Third, Trump\u2019s three brackets would increase taxes for many head of household filers. For example, the current lowest bracket is 10 percent, but Trump\u2019s lowest bracket is 12 percent. \"For example, in 2017 a single parent with one child who claims the standard deduction would face a 25 percent tax rate on adjusted gross income between $53,050 and $68,550, compared with just a 15 percent rate under current law,\" Roberton Williams, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center, wrote in Forbes. Put it altogether, 51 percent of single parents or about 5.8 million households would see a tax increase under Trump\u2019s plan, Batchelder calculated. As our colleagues at FactCheck.org noted, \"single parents tend to do worse under Trump\u2019s plan than under current law.\" For example, a single parent with an income of $75,000 and two school-age children would see his or her taxes increase by $2,440 or by $1,640 if the family had child care costs that could be deducted under Trump's plan, according to Batchelder. Similarly, a single parent making $50,000 and who had three children would face an increase of $1,188. The Tax Foundation, a free market-oriented think tank, has not released similar analysis. But its director of federal projects, Kyle Pomerleau, found no faults with Batchelder\u2019s report. .@lilybatch We were able to replicate many of the numbers in the report. The results seem reasonable to me. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment."

Here's why we can confidently label this claim as false:\n\n1. The post claims that the user \"opted out\" of Obamacare after completing the application, but according to CMS spokesperson, it is not possible to complete an application and then opt out at the end. Therefore, this claim is false.\n2. The post states that the user received an email informing them of fines they would face, but PolitiFact points out several errors in this claim. Firstly, the system would not send any user an email if they failed to complete an application. Secondly, any fines would be calculated as part of the user's overall income tax form 1040, and not sent as a bill. Finally, the IRS cannot use any other form of punishment, including suspending driver's licenses or placing federal tax liens on property. Therefore, this claim is false.\n3. The post claims that the fine would be $4,037, but PolitiFact notes that the penalty fee in 2014 is only 1% of income or $95 per person for the year, whichever is higher. Even if we take the user's claimed income of $45-55k annually, they would not have to pay more than $550 by 2015. Therefore, this claim is false.\n4. The post claims that if a person fails to pay their fine, their driver's license will be suspended until paid, and if they fail to pay for 24 consecutive months, the government will place a federal tax lien on their home. PolitiFact confirms that neither of these penalties is possible under the Affordable Care Act. Therefore, this claim is false.\n5. The post suggests that people can give their bank information so that the government can automatically withdraw penalties weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. However, PolitiFact warns citizens not to hand out bank information online and notes that the Treasury Department does not have the authority to use any other form of punishment. Therefore, this claim is false.\n\nBased on the evidence provided by PolitiFact, we can confidently label the claim made in the Facebook post as false.",
    "doc": "Shortly after the the Obamacare insurance marketplace launched on Oct. 1, users of social media experienced a burst of complaints on Twitter and Facebook, ranging from technical glitches to substantive concerns. But for our readers, one post stood out. Many readers sent us a Facebook post that went viral and has since been circulated by chain-email. It was originally posted on the Facebook page of Healthcare.gov, the federal government\u2019s portal to the new insurance marketplace created under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. The marketplace is designed to offer one-stop shopping for health insurance plans for Americans whose employers do not offer coverage. The Facebook post claims to be from a man named Will Sheehan. (We couldn\u2019t confirm his identity.) The post says that he tried to sign up for Obamacare and then decided to not go along with it; he then said he received an email detailing fines he would face. Here\u2019s the full text of the post: \"I actually made it through this morning at 8:00 A.M. I have a preexisting condition (Type 1 Diabetes) and my income base was 45K-55K annually I chose tier 2 \u2018Silver Plan\u2019 and my monthly premiums came out to $597.00 with $13,988 yearly deductible!!! There is NO POSSIBLE way that I can afford this so I \u2018opt-out\u2019 and chose to continue along with no insurance. I received an email tonight at 5:00 P.M. informing me that my fine would be $4,037 and could be attached to my yearly income tax return. Then you make it to the \u2018REPERCUSSIONS PORTION\u2019 for \u2018non-payment\u2019 of yearly fine. First, your drivers license will be suspended until paid, and if you go 24 consecutive months with \u2018Non-Payment\u2019 and you happen to be a home owner, you will have a federal tax lien placed on your home. You can agree to give your bank information so that they can easy \u2018Automatically withdraw\u2019 your \u2018penalties\u2019 weekly, bi-weekly or monthly! This by no means is \u2018Free\u2019 or even \u2018Affordable\u2019.\" We will check a number of the post\u2019s claims below. \u2022 \"There is NO POSSIBLE way that I can afford this so I \u2018opt-out\u2019 and chose to continue along with no insurance.\" According to a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that runs the marketplace, this is not how the system works: \"There's no way for people to complete the online application and then affirmatively \u2018opt out\u2019 at the end. They would simply close the website or not enroll in a plan.\" \u2022 \"I received an email tonight at 5:00 P.M. informing me\" about the fines I would face. This is wrong on several levels. First, the system would not send any user an email if they failed to complete an application. Second, any fines would be calculated as part of the user\u2019s overall income tax form 1040 -- they wouldn\u2019t be sent as a bill. And third, any taxes would be owed by April 15, 2015 -- a year and a half from now. Someone being assessed a tax penalty by the Internal Revenue Service in early October doesn\u2019t even make any sense, since the applicant has many weeks to find another insurance plan and avoid a penalty. \u2022 \"My fine would be $4,037.\" This number is way out of line. Under the law, the penalty fee in 2014 is 1 percent of your yearly income or $95 per person for the year, whichever is higher. The fee increases every year. In 2016 it is 2.5 percent of income or $695 per person, whichever is higher. If we are to take this Facebook user\u2019s claims at face value -- that his \"income base was 45K-55K annually\"-- and if he has no dependents, he would not have to pay any more than $550, by 2015. To pay a penalty of $4,037 in 2014, you would need to be making making more than $403,700 a year. \u2022 \"Your drivers license will be suspended until paid.\" CMS told PolitiFact that nobody\u2019s driver's license will be suspended as a noncompliance penalty under the Affordable Care Act. Nothing in the law mentions that as a penalty, and driver\u2019s licenses are administered by state governments. \u2022 \"If you go 24 consecutive months with \u2018Non-Payment\u2019 and you happen to be a home owner, you will have a federal tax lien placed on your home.\" A Treasury Department spokesperson confirmed that the law specifically bars the IRS from using their normal means of collecting unpaid taxes, including the use of liens and levy. According to the law, the government \"shall not (i) file notice of lien with respect to any property of a taxpayer by reason of any failure to pay the penalty imposed by this section, or (ii) levy on any such property with respect to such failure.\u2019\u2019 Instead, the only thing the IRS can do to collect fines is to subtract it from any tax refund you qualify for. If you aren\u2019t due a refund, all the IRS can do is send you a letter. Another section of the health care law protects citizens from any other form of punishment. \"In the case of any failure by a taxpayer to timely pay any penalty (\u2026) such taxpayer shall not be subject to any criminal prosecution or penalty,\" it says. \u2022 \"You can agree to give your bank information so that they can easy \u2018Automatically withdraw\u2019 your \u2018penalties\u2019 weekly, bi-weekly or monthly!\" Don\u2019t take online banking advice from a Facebook post. The Treasury Department warns citizens not to hand out bank information online."

The evidence includes data from various studies conducted in different states, which show that Walmart is often the largest employer in these states and has a significant number of employees who receive public assistance. For example, in Florida, Walmart topped all companies operating in the state with the largest number of employees and family members eligible for Medicaid. Similarly, in Ohio, Wal-Mart was the top employer for workers and family members who receive Medicaid, food stamps, and cash assistance.

    "doc": "Leave it to Alan \"Congressman with Guts\" Grayson to get a security escort from Walmart on Thanksgiving.Grayson, who returns to Congress next year after losing his old seat in 2010, ditched his family on Thanksgiving to hand out turkey sandwiches to employees of an Orlando-area Walmart.Amid employee walkoutsacross the country, Grayson approachedworkers with his turkey tidings and told them about their right to join a union.Walmart employees are paid so little, he argued, they often seek government programs for help.\"In state after state, the largest group of Medicaid recipients is Walmart employees. I'm sure that the same thing is true of food stamp recipients. Each Walmart \u2018associate\u2019 costs the taxpayers an average of more than $1,000 in public assistance,\" Grayson wrote in a Huffington Post column on Nov. 24, 2012.He doubled down in a subsequent interview with The Young Turks show on Current TV, saying Walmart employees represent \"the largest group of food stamp recipients.\"Democrats and labor unions have long been critical of the non-union retailer and have recently been emphasizing that its low wages end up costing government because workers seek food stamps and other aid. (\"Wal-Mart\" is the corporation. \"Walmart\" is a store.)We wondered if Grayson was right that the chain's impact was that large, so we dug into the numbers.Largest group of Medicaid recipients?Newspapers, lawmakers and liberal policy groups for years have analyzed which companies have large numbers of employees that seek public health insurance assistance.In nearly all 24 states in which a study was completed, Grayson\u2019s point proved accurate, according to a list from Good Jobs First, a labor-funded groupthat has criticized government support for Wal-Mart.We should note not every study examined Medicaid, the joint state-federal partnership that insures the poor and disabled. Many reports focused on state-run programs aimed at people with low-paying jobs who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid and don\u2019t make enough to provide insurance their families (these are often called SCHIP).Philip Mattera, Good Jobs First research director, pointed to two simple reasons for it: Wal-Mart pays relatively low wages and is the biggest employer in the country.Here's a sampling:In Florida, Wal-Mart topped all companies operating in Florida with the largest number of employees and family members (12,300) eligible for Medicaid, according to a 2005 Tampa Bay Times story. Wal-Mart also ranked highly (No. 2) for dependents enrolled in Florida Healthy Kids or KidCare, trailing Miami-Dade County employees.In Missouri, where Wal-Mart is the largest employer behind state government, the state\u2019s social services department determined Walmart employees outnumbered all others with employees and family members enrolled in MO HealthNet, the state\u2019s Medicaid plan, in the first quarter of 2011. However, at almost 14 percent, it did not represent the highest percentage of workers enrolled or responsible for an enrollee (Dollar General, for instance, was much higher at 42 percent).And in Pennsylvania, a 2006 Philadelphia Inquirerinvestigation revealed the company had the highest percentage of employees enrolled in Medicaid. One in six of Walmart\u2019s 48,000 Pennsylvania employees were enrolled in Medicaid, costing the state about $15 million a year (it\u2019s likely higher because the Inquirer\u2019s story did not cover employees\u2019 dependents on Medicaid, or any other public assistance such as food stamps).There was at least one exception on Good Jobs First\u2019s list. In Vermont in 2005, Wal-Mart placed fourth of companies with employees and families enrolled in Medicaid, trailing Price Chopper, McDonald\u2019s and Hannaford, according to Good Jobs First, which cited a 2005 Vermont Guardian report.As labor groups pushed states to consider laws that would make Wal-Mart and companies like it pay more for employee health benefits, the New York Timesreported on a 2005 internal memofrom a Wal-Mart executive that showed the company knew a \"significant number of associates and their children who receive health insurance through public insurance programs.\"The memo from Susan Chambers, Wal-Mart's executive vice president for benefits, said 5 percent of Walmart associates were on Medicaid compared to an average of national employers of 4 percent. In sum, she wrote, 46 percent of associates\u2019 children were either on Medicaid or uninsured. Her memo did not address employees on food stamps.\"On both of these issues \u2013 affordability and public assistance \u2013 it is important to note that our offering and performance are on par with other retailers,\" Chambers wrote. \"Wal-Mart\u2019s critics, however, hold it to a \u2018large company\u2019 standard, not a retailer standard.\"She continued: \"Despite the difference in industry economics, critics believe we should behave more like a GM or a Microsoft than a Target or a Sears.\"So on Medicaid, the sampling of states shows Grayson\u2019s assessment of this happening in \"state after state\" is accurate. Largest group for food stamp recipients?There\u2019s no national tally of where food stamp recipients work.A handful of researchers and reporters have mined state data for Walmart employees on food stamps, though not as frequently as the Medicaid studies.In Ohio, the state Department of Job and Family Services report found Wal-Mart to be the state\u2019stop employerfor workers and family members who receive Medicaid (16,098), food stamps (14,799) and cash assistance (803), according to January 2012 numbers. A state spokesman cautioned the reportdoes not tell the difference between full- and part-time employees, or employees who do not yet qualify for benefits, or why employees sought Medicaid.In Maine, Wal-Mart topped employers with the largest number of workers on MaineCare, food stamps and temporary cash assistance, according to a 2005 Lewiston Sun Journal report, but it did not break down how many employees receive each subsidy. The company was fourth in the percentage of employees on public assistance.In Florida, 1.9 million households receive food stamps, and nearly 500,000 have earned income as of October 2012. Of those with earned income, 9,095 households get paychecks from Wal-Mart, according to a report prepared for PolitiFact by the state Department of Children and Families.The Florida taxpayer tab for their food stamps: $2.6 million.DCF cannot determine how this bill compares to other Florida employers. The employer data field in DCF\u2019s database is not mandatory and is usually filled in by hand. That leads to a lot of different entries for the same workplace (Wallmart, Wall mart, Wal-mart, Walmart, etc), making it difficult to draw conclusions about all employers.Grayson cited a figure circulated by the liberal Daily Kosthat \"as many as 80 percent of workers in Wal-Mart stores using food stamps.\"(We couldn't find a study that backs up that number, but did find it was mentioned as an anecdote.)Grayson could not provide solid evidence to us that he was right, but he said it was accurate largely because Walmart is simply such a big company. \"Walmart is the largest private employer in the country, by a substantial margin,\" Grayson wrote. \"Even if 100 percent of the employees of the second largest employer were on food stamps \u2013 an unlikely scenario, to say the least \u2013 Walmart employees would still be the largest group.\"He added: \"Given the similarity between qualification rules for Medicaid and food stamps, if Walmart is #1 in a state for Medicaid, it\u2019s very likely that it is #1 for food stamps, too.\"Here, too, there is support for Grayson's point, but it is not conclusive.$1,000?There's less factual support for this aspect of Grayson's claim. We found the data is eight years old.Grayson\u2019s spokesman cited a 2004 study called the \"Hidden Cost of Wal-Mart Jobs\" by the University of California Berkeley\u2019s Labor Center. The study, which Wal-Mart has criticized, analyzed Walmart employees\u2019 use of safety net programs in California.The researchers found taxpayers paid $86 million a year to subsidize Walmart workers\u2019 wages -- $32 million for health programs and $54 million in other assistance. (\"Other assistance\" could be food stamps, subsidized housing and school lunches, and use of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is a tax credit for low- to moderate-income workers.)The average taxpayer bill per employee was $730 for health expenses and $1,222 for other expenses, researchers found. The totals for other large California retailers totaled $521 for health and $880 for other.Also widely cited by the anti-Walmart contingent is a 2004 Democratic U.S. House committee reportthat examined the company\u2019s record on many issues, including public subsidizing of employees\u2019 wages. A 200-person Walmart store could require $420,750 in tax dollars for employee assistance a year, working out to $2,103 per worker, according to the Democratic Staff of the Committee on Education and the Workforce report.Walmart does not dispute that many of its employees receive public health assistance. But company spokesman Kory Lundberg criticized Grayson citing the Berkeley study, saying, \"They\u2019re pointing out data that\u2019s at least seven to eight years old.\"Plus, he said, it\u2019s expected the company would top such lists because its employs the most people.And even though just over half of its employees take the company health care plan, Lundberg said, workers often have other options for health insurance, including from the military, Medicare, or a parent\u2019s or spouse\u2019s plan."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for Mr. Moshein's claim that the University of Texas can afford to build a medical school because it has a $7 billion endowment and its football program had a $50 million profit last year. The evidence provided in the article supports the idea that UT does have a large endowment and profitable football program, but it also indicates that these funds are not readily available for use in establishing a medical school.\n\nFirstly, the article states that the UT System Board of Regents has committed at least $25 million a year towards the envisioned medical school, plus $5 million annually for eight years to buy equipment. This indicates that a significant portion of the funds needed for the medical school have already been committed.\n\nSecondly, the article notes that UT enjoys around $400 million in combined annual proceeds from the available fund and many endowments established to support specific scholarships, professorships or other projects. While this suggests that there are additional funds available, it also indicates that these funds are committed to existing priorities and cannot be easily redirected towards a new project like a medical school.\n\nFinally, the article quotes UT's chief financial officer, Kevin Hegarty, as stating that if football profits were redirected to a medical school, programs that currently benefit from the profits would be out of luck. This suggests that even if UT had the funds available, it would not be feasible to redirect them towards a new project without causing harm to existing priorities.\n\nBased on these points, it can be argued that while UT does have the means to afford a medical school in terms of its endowment and football program profits, there are constraints on how these funds can be used. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for Mr. Moshein's claim.",
    "doc": "Rob Moshein of Austin says he favors a local University of Texas medical school but will vote against a proposed tax increase pitched as vital to fulfilling such plans.\"Why?\" Moshein said in a letter to the editor in the Oct. 14, 2012, Austin American-Statesman. \"Because the University of Texas has a $7 billion endowment, and the football program brought in $50 (million) in profit last year alone.\"\"UT can well afford this medical school,\" his letter says. \"...Find the funding elsewhere. If it\u2019s really that important, I suspect they will. They have the cash.\"To date, the UT System Board of Regents has committed at least $25 million a year toward the envisioned medical school, plus $5 million annually for eight years to buy equipment. This commitment is contingent on $35 million in annual community funding, which would come from the tax hike proposed by Travis County\u2019s Central Health, along with continued financial support from the Seton Healthcare Family.So, UT does stand to pony up.Still, we wondered if UT could pay for the sought school thanks to its $7 billion endowment and football team profits of $50 million, as Moshein's letter puts it.By email, Moshein told us his endowment figure came from a Wikipedia entry for UT-Austin.We ran the figure past Randy Wallace, the UT System\u2019s chief budget officer, who emailed that one could arrive at such an estimate for the Austin campus\u2019s overall \"endowment\" by imputing how much revenue it receives thanks to its stake in the Permanent University Fund plus the value of many individual campus endowments built on individual donations.The permanent fund, established in 1876, helps support eligible institutions of the UT and Texas A&M University systems. Its value is rooted in 2.1 million acres of West Texas lands that produces two streams of income -- oil and gas royalties and surface interests such as grazing leases. Annual distributions from the total return on all investment assets is transferred to the Available University Fund, with two thirds going to the UT System and one third to the A&M system.Moshein also noted a story posted on July 2, 2012, by Alcalde, the magazine of UT\u2019s Ex-Students\u2019 Association, which says that the annual distributions depend \"on the overall health of the global financial markets, because the return on investment depends on market performance.\"Wallace pointed out to us the annual distributions cannot exceed 7 percent of the average market value of the permanent fund investments. He said the fund was valued at $14.4 billion in the year that ended Aug. 31, 2011, and will be valued at more than that for the 2012 fiscal year once accounting is complete.In 2011, Wallace said, some $506 million was distributed, with the UT System landing about $350 million. The Austin campus ultimately received nearly $158 million, he said, about 45 percent of what was available. That fits with a regents\u2019 policy that 45 percent of the UT System\u2019s money fielded from the available fund each year must be spent supporting UT-Austin.Wallace said the regents also are permitted to spend such money on system administration; debt service on certain bonds backed by the permanent fund; and initiatives that benefit the system as a whole.For the year that ran through August 2010, the regents forwarded nearly $246 million in fund proceeds to the Austin campus, counting $20 million designated to support faculty recruitment and $5 million for the Center for Technology Commercialization. Wallace said the added dollops were to be spent over several years.The regents budgeted $178.5 million in fund proceeds for the Austin campus for the year that ran through August 2012, according to a December 2011 UT System report to the governor and lawmakers. The report projects the Austin campus to field $166 million in this way in 2013 and $182 million in 2014.So, it looks like the Austin campus can lately count on annual infusions of $158 million or more, thanks to the permanent fund.Next, we turned to Moshein\u2019s claim that the football team reaped $50 million in profits last year, which he attributed to 2009-10 totals described on the BusinessofCollegeSports.com sports business news website.Most recently, UT football has netted some 56 percent more than that. To our inquiry, Nick Voinis, a UT athletics department spokesman, passed along the university\u2019s latest summary of program revenues and expenses as submitted to the U.S. Department of Education. It says that in 2011-12, football program revenues were $103.8 million while expenses were $25.9 million, leaving a football profit of nearly $78 million.And was the $78 million equivalent to loose cash? Negative, UT officials said.By phone, Voinis told us the bulk of football\u2019s profit helped cover the athletic department\u2019s administrative costs and supported other sports programs.On a UT web page, the athletic department says athletic-related income covers its salaries, fringe benefits, utilities and construction plus an administrative fee paid to the university for accounting and payroll costs, among others. The department also pays approximately $15 million a year for other goods and services such as utilities, student-athlete housing, student-athlete tuition, event parking and transportation, the web entry says. Finally, from 2005-06 to 2010-11, the department says, it transferred $14.4 million to various academic programs.A senior associate athletic director, Dave Marmion, said by phone that of the university\u2019s 19 other men\u2019s and women\u2019s intercollegiate sports in 2011-12, 17 drew on football\u2019s gains to cover expenses.During the year, the baseball and men\u2019s basketball teams had more revenue than expenses, UT\u2019s submission to the education department indicates. UT\u2019s unprofitable sports teams ran a little more than $17 million in the red, the report indicates. But this tally does not count $67 million in expenses marked as not attributable to a particular sport or sports.Broadly, Voinis said, \"football drives our budget. It pays for a lot of things around here.\"We asked how UT would fund the unprofitable sports if the football proceeds were applied, say, to launch a medical school. Voinis suggested we ask higher-ups and campus spokesman Gary Susswein put us in touch with Kevin Hegarty, the institution\u2019s chief financial officer, who said that if football profits were redirected to a medical school, programs that currently benefit from the profits would be out of luck.Hegarty agreed the university enjoys around $400 million in combined annual proceeds from the available fund and many endowments established to support specific scholarships, professorships or other projects. But almost all the project-specific endowment funds could not be redirected to a medical school, he said, while shifting revenue tied to the permanent fund would short existing commitments to basic operating costs such as faculty and staff salaries and utilities.\"It\u2019s committed,\" Hegarty said. \"I can\u2019t just take it without saying, \u2018Don\u2019t teach whatever you\u2019re teaching.\u2019 ...I don\u2019t have any endowments there to fund a medical school.\"We also asked Wallace of the UT System if UT-Austin could apply its permanent fund-related receipts to a project like a medical school. Legally yes, but practically no, he replied. \"The consequences of doing it would decimate the institution,\" he said.Moshein, asked for further thoughts, did not quibble with UT having existing priorities. He said by email he still intends to vote against the tax increase."

He repeated his positions in a July speech after he declared his candidacy. His plan includes several specific ideas: Some other candidates have also brought up tuition increases, student debt and federal spending on higher education. In June, NewJerseyGov. Chris Christielaid out several ideas for reforming post-secondary education with an eye on reining in costs. Christie suggested itemized tuition bills that detailed what the money was paying for; allowing students to pay just for classes and not facilities or add-ons; and letting students obtain private financing for college with an option to pay it back with a percentage of earnings after graduation. He also floated ideas of providing tax credits for apprenticeship programs and for donating to debt reduction organizations that help students pay for schooling in exchange for community service. Carly Fiorina, the former technology executive, said in a July Q&A on Breitbart.com that student debt was out of control because \"the federal government under Democrats has nationalized the student loan business.\" She suggested letting private banks compete for student loans. She also said the accreditation process should allow for more for-profit universities and online courses. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said in April 2015 he thought college tuition should be tax deductible, although he did not offer specifics of how that plan should work. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush earlier in August sparred with Clinton on Twitter about tuition, while Ben Carson, a former pediatric neurosurgeon, in February wrote a Washington Times editorial suggesting needy people should get jobs if they require help payingfor college. Other candidates have been even less vocal on the subject, saying simply that college costs are a problem that have been dealt with, or nothing at all."

Instead, the bursting of the housing bubble and the global financial crisis were the largest factors crippling the economy.\n\nThe article provides several pieces of evidence to support this conclusion:\n\n1. Florida's debt levels increased through 2010 but then declined, which suggests that the state's fiscal position was not significantly eroded during that time.\n2. Real estate values in Florida appreciated by a high rate from 1995 to 2003, but when the bust came, it hit hard, with nearly 14% of Florida home loans in foreclosure by 2010, edging out Nevada for the highest in the nation.\n3. Most economists interviewed by the author believe that the bursting of the housing bubble and the global financial crisis were far and away the largest factors crippling the Florida economy, with state economic policy playing a minimal role.\n4.

The actual causes of Florida's severe recession were much more complex and involved factors beyond state-level taxing and borrowing. Therefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "During his 2013 State of the State speech, Florida Gov. Rick Scott defended his record on the economy and the state\u2019s fiscal condition during his first two years in office.\"Our Florida Families First budget\" represents \"responsible stewardship of taxpayer money,\" Scott, a Republican, said in the address. \"Washington, D.C., could learn a few budget lessons from Florida. The contrast between our state and the nation\u2019s capital is remarkable. Now is not the time to turn back to the legacy of taxing and borrowing that crippled the economy we inherited two years ago. We must stay the course for economic growth and job creation.\"We wondered whether Scott was justified in saying that a \"legacy of taxing and borrowing \u2026 crippled the economy\" he inherited in 2010.We should note that we are analyzing this claim using the assumption that Scott is referring to the state\u2019s economy when he talks about the \"legacy of taxing and borrowing.\" His office confirmed that he was referring to Florida's economy as the one he \"inherited\" in January 2011, not the nation\u2019s. As evidence, they pointed us to statistics showing Florida's debt levels increased through 2010 but then declined.To check Scott's claim, we contacted a half dozen experts on the Florida economy, primarily academic economists and analysts with financial firms. These experts were unanimous: Problems of taxing and borrowing weren\u2019t the major causes of the severe recession the Sunshine State is still struggling out of. Real estate was, exacerbated by the reach of the national recession.Florida real estate values appreciated by 4.1 percent annually from 1995 to 2000, and then by 11.3 percent annually between 2000 and 2003. But when the bust came, it hit hard. By 2010, nearly 14 percent of Florida home loans were in foreclosure, edging out Nevada for the highest in the nation. The serious delinquency rate for home loans in Florida peaked in the third quarter of 2010 at nearly 20 percent -- almost twice the rate of Arizona and California, two of the other hardest-hit states.\"Most economists -- maybe all economists -- think that the bursting of the housing bubble and the global financial crisis were far and away the largest factors crippling the Florida economy,\" said Bill Seyfried, professor of economics at Rollins College in Winter Park. \"State economic policy played a minimal role.\"Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics, agreed. \"Florida\u2019s severe housing collapse, the seeds of which were sown during Jeb Bush\u2019s governorship, combined with the national recession to deliver the Florida economy a devastating one-two punch from 2007 to 2009,\" he said. \"Tax revenues obviously fell during the recession, which you would expect to happen in any state, but there was not a substantial erosion in the state\u2019s fiscal position sufficient to cause a downgrade in the state\u2019s credit rating.\"Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida\u2019s Institute for Economic Competitiveness, said the combination of the severe national recession, a housing bust and a financial crisis amounted to a perfect storm for the state.\"As 401(k)s turned into 201(k)s,\" fewer retirees could move to Florida, Snaith said. This, in turn, dealt a body blow to the construction and real estate sectors. \"This tied the Florida economy\u2019s hands behind its back,\" Snaith said. \"Those factors, more than anything, made the recession harder to recover from. \u2026 The source of the state\u2019s woes certainly was not borrowing and spending.\"Meanwhile, tourism, a backbone of Florida\u2019s economy, couldn\u2019t last for long in this economic environment, said Paul M. Mason, an economist at the University of North Florida. The decline in housing values -- exacerbated by investors shifting money from housing to oil funds when petroleum prices surged in the summer of 2008 -- \"made people feel less wealthy, putting a major damper on tourism from both inside and outside the state,\" he said.One lesson of the last recession is that the Florida economy is deeply intertwined with the national economy, experts say. \"Whatever factors contributed to the last national recession and its aftermath also contributed to the state\u2019s recession and its aftermath,\" said Joseph DeSalvo, an economist at the University of South Florida.As for tax rates, they would be \"an extremely low-rated cause of economic decline,\" said Elizabeth Strom, an urban and regional planning professor at the University of South Florida. \"For Florida, the national recession coupled with our economic dependence on real estate development and the huge speculative bubble that popped alongside national economic recession would have far stronger explanatory power.\"There may be one silver lining for Florida, said Scott J. Brown, senior vice president and chief economist at Raymond James Financial, based in St. Petersburg. \"Areas of the country that had larger housing bubbles, such as Florida, were going to have larger corrections,\" Brown said. \"However, with housing recovering in most areas of the country, Florida has more room for improvement in housing than most other states. Bigger bubble, bigger bust, bigger (eventual) recovery.\""

    "doc": "Joining the national anger over North Carolina\u2019s new law replacing the controversial House Bill 2 was Caitlyn Jenner. Jenner is perhaps the most famous transgender person in America. So when she began criticizing North Carolina\u2019s new law to her 4 million Twitter followers, people took note. A bipartisan deal between legislators and Gov. Roy Cooper last week got rid of some of HB2\u2019s controversial parts, but it retained two parts of HB2 that Democrats and advocates for LGBT rights have criticized for the past year. Jenner has been among those critics, even though she\u2019s a Republican. And she was not pleased about the compromise. \"The new law orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020 and unfair \u2018bathroom bans\u2019 remain,\" she said. There have been exaggerations and falsehoods on both sides of the HB2 debate. We\u2019ve fact-checked many of them. And this claim sounded like a stretch, so we took a look at it. We contacted Jenner\u2019s publicist to help us understand what she meant, but have not heard back. Bathroom rules We\u2019ll tackle Jenner\u2019s claims in reverse order. She ended her post by saying that North Carolina\u2019s \"\u2018bathroom bans\u2019 remain.\" That seems to be a reference to the provision of HB2 that had banned transgender people in government facilities from using the bathroom of the gender with which they identify \u2013 and which instead required everyone to use the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificates. But although Jenner said that ban remains on the books, the opposite is true. The most high-profile change this new law made was getting rid of that part of HB2. In fact, that\u2019s precisely why so many conservative politicians and interest groups opposed the new law. Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition, said it \"leaves the state without a statewide public policy on privacy and safety in bathrooms, locker rooms and showers.\" (As an aside, we previously found there are virtually no instances of sexual predators using transgender-friendly bathroom laws as cover to commit crimes.) North Carolina has now rejoined 48 other states in having no law about who can use which bathroom. The only outlier now is Washington, which is on the other end of the spectrum and has a transgender-friendly bathroom law. It is possible that Jenner meant this part of her claim as a reference to the new law\u2019s prohibition on state agencies, colleges and school districts regulating access to bathrooms and locker rooms -- which blocks them from creating transgender-friendly policies. But no matter how you interpret it, the fact remains that transgender people are no longer banned from using the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. There is now simply no law at all on bathroom access. Furthermore, any private business that wants to enact its own transgender-friendly bathroom policies has always been able to do so and still can. And that leads us to the other part of her claim. Mandatory discrimination? \"The new law orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020,\" Jenner said. What the law says is that through Dec. 1, 2020, cities and counties can\u2019t pass local anti-discrimination ordinances related to employment or public accommodations. That means LGBT people won\u2019t be protected from discrimination in North Carolina for at least the next three-plus years, unless the legislature makes another change. But that\u2019s a far cry from ordering cities to discriminate, which this law does not do. No, the mayors of North Carolina are not required to engage in anti-gay behavior, nor must they require businesses in their communities to do the same. Similarly, there\u2019s no federal law protecting LGBT people from workplace discrimination. That doesn\u2019t mean Congress is ordering every company in America to discriminate against gay or transgender people. And most other states also lack these protections, as we found in a previous fact-check. Improvements for gay rights And despite widespread condemnation from LGBT activists, the new law did make some concessions to HB2 opponents. For instance, HB2\u2019s bans on local ordinances were indefinite, but the new bans expire in 2020. It rolled back a provision of HB2 that \u2013 as we found in a previous fact-check \u2013 might have prohibited cities and counties from protecting even their own employees from anti-LGBT discrimination. There\u2019s no more ambiguity now. Under the new law, if local elected officials want to protect their own local government employees from anti-LGBT discrimination, they can. HB2 had also banned local governments from having certain requirements for would-be contractors \u2013 including, for example, a mandate that the contractors have discrimination protections for LGBT people. Now, cities and counties are once more allowed to have those requirements for contractors, according to the UNC School of Government\u2019s Norma Houston \u2013 who is an expert in public government contracting \u2013 as well as Carrboro Town Attorney Nick Herman, who said the town\u2019s pro-LGBT contractor ordinance is now back in place."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it is appropriate to label the claim \"Radio Marti and TV Marti have spent more than $500 million to reach less than 1 percent of the Cuban population\" as True.\n\nThe article cites a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report from 2009 that states that over $500 million has been spent on broadcasting to Cuba since the mid-1980s. The GAO report also notes that the best available research shows that the television operation's audience is small, and that there is no real way to get valid audience numbers for Radio Marti. Additionally, a 2010 Senate Foreign Relations Committee report summarizes recent survey results for the radio service, which show that fewer than 2 percent of respondents in 2003, 2005, and 2006 said they listened to Radio Marti during the previous week, and fewer than 1 percent of respondents in 2008 said they listened to Radio Marti during the previous week.\n\nThe article also mentions that Cuban jamming efforts present a consistent challenge to American government broadcasting, which could further limit the reach of these broadcasts. However, the article notes that the U.S. response has been to shift frequencies up to 10 times a day (with an unknown impact on listenership), and to build a digital distribution strategy that uses cell phone text messaging, DVDs, and flash drive technologies. According to the Broadcasting Board of Governors' 2013 annual report, text messages and emails \"reach nearly 1 million Cubans each week.\"\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the claim is supported by the evidence provided in the article. The $500 million spent on broadcasting to Cuba has not resulted in a significant reach of the population, with audience numbers consistently showing low levels of penetration. While the Cuban government's jamming efforts may contribute to this lack of reach, the American response of shifting frequencies and building a digital distribution strategy does not appear to have significantly increased the reach of these broadcasts. Therefore, the label True is appropriate.",
    "doc": "Over the decades since the Cuban revolution, American feelings toward our closest Communist neighbor have mellowed, if only just a bit. According to aGallup poll, antipathy toward restoring ties with Cuba has inched down since the 1970s. Other research suggests a generational shift is underway as U.S.-born Cuban Americans come of age and move away from the firm anti-communist line of the Republican Party. MSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell took aim at the American broadcasts designed to stir discontent with the Cuban government, Radio Marti and TV Marti. Both seek to offer Cubans an alternative source of news. O\u2019Donnell cast them as a colossal waste of taxpayer money. \"Radio Marti and TV Marti have spent more than $500 million to reach less than 1 percent of the Cuban population, and as far as we can tell, change their minds about nothing,\" O\u2019Donnell said on July 8, 2014. \"No politician who seriously aspires to the president who will dare to say a word about this wasted $500 million, because when it comes to Cuba policy, the American government is still crazy after all these years.\" We can\u2019t know whether these American broadcasts have shaped the opinions of Cubans, but we can look into O\u2019Donnell\u2019s claim about the money and the market penetration. Limited audience data O\u2019Donnell\u2019s colleagues at MSNBC pointed to a 2009 Government Accountability Office report. The GAO works on behalf of Congress to assess whether government programs spend their money wisely and achieve what they were set up to do. The 2009 study focused on TV Marti but at the very top, it spoke to the total spending. \"More than $500 million that has been spent over the years on broadcasting to Cuba,\" the GAO analysts wrote. We found a 2011 GAO report that put total spending at $660 million since the launch of Radio Marti in the mid1980s. As for the television operation\u2019s audience, the 2009 GAO report said that the best available research shows that \"it is small.\" The International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) oversees the Marti project. \"Less than 1 percent of respondents to IBB telephone surveys since 2003 reported that they had watched TV Mart\u00ed during the past week,\" the report said. \"Notably, results from the 2006 and 2008 telephone surveys show no increase in reported TV Mart\u00ed viewership following the launch of AeroMartiand DirecTV broadcasting in 2006.\" AeroMartiwas a $5 million a year effort to broadcast from an airplane. It has since ended. DirecTV made programs available to those Cubans with illegal dish antennas. Measuring audience size in Cuba, for either television or radio, faces a huge hurdle -- tuning in could get you in trouble with the government. The GAO report notes, this makes it difficult to get reliable responses. Daniel Walsh is a communications professor at Appalachian State University who has studied America\u2019s broadcast efforts in Cuba. \"There is no real way to get valid audience numbers for Radio Marti,\" Walsh said. \"I would say that 1 percent may be a bit low but not far off. Some Cubans, including government officials, listen to Radio Marti but don't admit it.\" The International Broadcasting Bureau hired a firm to place calls to Cuba, mainly from Costa Rica. But according to the Cuban telecomm company Etesca, there are only about 2 million cell phone lines and about 1.3 million landlines.With a total population ofmore than 11 million, phone calls are unlikely to reach a representative sample. A 2010 Senate Foreign Relations Committee report summarized recent survey results for the radio service. \"Fewer than 2 percent of respondents in 2003, 2005, and 2006 said they listened to Radio Marti during the previous week,\" the report said. \"In 2008, fewer than 1 percent of respondents said they listened to Radio Marti during the previous week.\" The numbers have not always been so low. Philip Peters served in the State Department during the Reagan and Bush administrations. In congressional testimony in 2002, Peters said he believed in the project\u2019s mission but drew attention to an \"alarming statistic.\" \"Radio Marti\u2019s audience share has plummeted to 5 percent in 2001, down from 9 percent in 2000 and 71 percent 10 years ago, according to professional survey research commissioned by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), Radio Marti\u2019s oversight body,\" Peters said. According to the GAO, concerns about the validity of these audience measures led the IBB to halt telephone surveys after 2008. The division that runs Radio and TV Marti, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, has interviewed recent arrivals from Cuba. Their results show significantly higher penetration. About 30 percent said they had listened to Radio Marti at some point during their last six months in Cuba. However, about half of those said they stopped because Cuban jamming made it difficult to listen. About 4 percent said they had watched TV Marti. Program administrators cautioned that these results also fail to give an accurate view of market penetration because the total number of people surveyed is small, less than 400, and people who have chosen to leave Cuba do not represent a random sample. Nicholas Cull, a professor at the University of Southern California, has studied the Marti project and believes it lacks an appreciable following in Cuba. \"Everything I've heard suggests it is tiny,\" Cull said. Cuban jamming efforts present a consistent challenge to American government broadcasting. The Cuban government can effectively block reception by broadcasting on the same frequency as the American programs but at a much higher power. The U.S. response has been to shift frequencies up to 10 times a day (with an unknown impact on listenership), and to build a digital distribution strategy that uses cell phone text messaging, DVDs and flash drive technologies. According to theBroadcasting Board of Governors2013 annual report, text messages and emails \"reach nearly 1 million Cubans each week.\" However, a spokesperson said it is unclear how many messages are read. Staff told PunditFact there are more than 660,000 cell phone numbers and more than 360,000 email addresses in their distribution database. They said they harvested this information from the Web and online sources and verified that the numbers and addresses were still active. The texting and email effort began three years ago. According to government data, there are around 1 million cell phones in total in Cuba. The size of the Marti database might represent significant market penetration, although staff said \"the vast majority of the cell phones and emails we have in our distribution lists did not opt-in.\" That is, the Cubans did not request the information the Marti service offers. About 45,000 texts go out each month. In the past six months, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting has received 349 texts. Staff said Cuba is able to block sensitive messages based on key words. The International Broadcasting Bureau has developed applications for smart phones for users to share messages, but the Cuban government moved only a few months ago to begin email access over its wireless network. The cost is very high, about $1.20 per megabyte. The average worker makes, officially, about $20 a month."

    "justification": "The claim made by Rep. Chris Collins that \"4 million American workers have received raises and bonuses, and 90% of Americans are seeing bigger paychecks this month\" is accurate based on the evidence provided. The evidence includes data from Americans for Tax Reform, which supports the Republican tax bill, and statements from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.\n\nFirstly, the evidence shows that at least 4 million workers have received bonuses or other benefits thanks to the new tax law, as reported by Americans for Tax Reform. This number has grown from 3 million workers reported by President Donald Trump at the end of January, suggesting that more workers are benefiting from the tax reform.\n\nSecondly, the U.S. Department of the Treasury predicted that 90% of working Americans would see an increase in take-home pay by the middle of February due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Although we did not hear back from the agency to confirm this prediction, the statement from Secretary Mnuchin suggests that a significant portion of workers will indeed receive higher take-home pay.\n\nWhile some experts have noted that the actual share of workers with more take-home pay may be lower than 90%, the evidence provided supports the claim that many Americans are seeing bigger paychecks as a result of the tax reform. Factors such as higher health insurance premiums could offset some of the increase in take-home pay, but the overall impact of the tax reform on workers' paychecks appears to be positive.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is reasonable to label Rep. Chris Collins' claim as True.",
    "doc": "U.S. Rep. Chris Collins said many Americans are already benefiting from the tax law Republicans in Congress passed in December. Collins used the claim to attack House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in a tweet. \"Because of #TaxReform, 4 million American workers have received raises and bonuses, and 90% of Americans are seeing bigger paychecks this month,\" Collins tweeted. \"Despite what @NancyPelosi may say, this isn\u2019t \"crumbs\" for hardworking families in #WNY.\" Pelosi had previously called the tax benefits for middle- and low-income earners \"crumbs\"compared to what wealthy earners would receive. Republicans who support the tax plan disagree. They believe the tax bill provides significant relief for those workers. Collins, a Republican from suburban Buffalo,says those benefits have already started. Is he right? \u20184 million American workers\u2019 President Donald Trump claimed 3 million workers in the U.S. had already received a pay increase or bonus thanks to the tax bill at the end of January. PolitiFact rated that claim Mostly True. PolitiFact checked Trump\u2019s claim using data from Americans for Tax Reform, a group that advocates for lower taxes. The group supported the Republican tax bill. The group has a running list of companies that have announced bonuses or other benefits based on press releases and media reports since the tax law passed. At the end of January, at least 286 companies had announced benefits for more than 3 million workers. That number has since grown to more than 4 million workers from 408 companies, according to the group. Those workers have gotten a bonus, pay increase, 401(k) hike, or utility rate cut because of the new tax law, according to reports. That\u2019s not a small number of workers, but it accounts for less than 3 percent of the total employed population in the U.S. Experts also told PolitiFact that some of the bonuses may have already been planned before the tax law to retain workers in a tight labor market. Larger paychecks The second part of Collins\u2019 claim is based on a prediction from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The agency said in January that 90 percent of working Americans would have less federal tax withheld from their paychecks by the middle of February. Employers had until Feb. 15 to implement the lower federal tax rates. \"We\u2019re estimating that 90 percent of workers are going to see an increase in take-home pay because of the Tax Cuts [and Jobs] Act,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said. We reached out to the agency to see if its prediction panned out for February. We did not hear back. The actual share of workers with more take-home pay may be lower than 90 percent, according to Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \"It is true that roughly 90 percent of Americans will get a tax cut this year as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\" Gleckman said. But many Americans will not see higher take-home pay because of other factors, like higher health insurance premiums. Higherpremiums could exceed any increase in take-home pay. Premiums for individual and employer-sponsored health plans are expected to rise again this year. An argument could be made that without the new tax rates, employees would have less money to pay for the higher premiums. More benefits from the law will be available during next year\u2019s tax filing period. That\u2019s when other provisions begin, like a higher standard deduction for filers."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",

    "justification": "The label \"True\" is an appropriate label for the claim made in the prompt. The evidence provided in the article supports the claim that the 1956 Republican Party platform supported equal pay, minimum wage, asylum for refugees, protections for unions, and more.\n\nFirstly, the platform mentioned seven specific items that align with current Democratic talking points, including providing federal assistance to low-income communities, protecting Social Security, extending the minimum wage, improving unemployment benefit system, strengthening labor laws to help workers join a union, and ensuring equal pay for equal work regardless of sex. These are all issues that are generally associated with the Democratic Party today.\n\nSecondly, while the 2012 Republican platform takes a more skeptical view of federal assistance to low-income communities and immigration, the 1956 platform does not express the same level of opposition. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of \"promoting fully the Republican-sponsored Rural Development Program\" and ensuring that \"the government will continue to support and strengthen our farm economy.\"\n\nThirdly, the article notes that many refugees were coming from communist countries in Eastern Europe during the Cold War era, indicating that the 1956 platform's support for providing asylum for thousands of refugees was not particularly controversial at the time.\n\nFinally, the article highlights a difference in approach to labor unions between the two platforms. While the 2012 platform is critical of President Barack Obama's immigration policies and accuses him of granting amnesty to illegal aliens, the 1956 platform takes a more neutral stance on immigration, simply promising to \"create humane procedures to encourage illegal aliens to return home voluntarily.\"\n\nBased on these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the 1956 Republican Party platform supported many of the same issues as the current Democratic Party platform. Therefore, the label \"True\" is an appropriate label for the claim made in the prompt.",
    "doc": "Liberals are getting nostalgic about the 1950s Republican agenda -- at least judging by the social media meme several readers recently sent us. The meme, created by the group Occupy Democrats, summarized a few planks from the 1956 Republican Party platform, followed by the wistful comment, \"Share if you miss the good old days!\" Here are the seven planks listed in the meme, which to today\u2019s ear sound more like Democratic talking points: 1. Provide federal assistance to low-income communities; 2. Protect Social Security; 3. Provide asylum for refugees; 4. Extend minimum wage; 5. Improve unemployment benefit system so it covers more people; 6. Strengthen labor laws so workers can more easily join a union; 7. Assure equal pay for equal work regardless of sex. We wondered whether the meme accurately describes these elements of the 1956 platform, and if so, whether the 1956 document contrasts sharply with the most recent party platform in 2012. So we took a closer look. What the 1956 platform said We located a copy of the official party platform from 1956, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was running (successfully, as it turned out) for his second term as president. All told, the meme is generally accurate in portraying these seven elements of the 1956 platform, with some caveats. On federal assistance to low-income communities, the 1956 platform said the party would \"promote fully the Republican-sponsored Rural Development Program to broaden the operation and increase the income of low income farm families and help tenant farmers.\" On protecting Social Security, the platform touted the Eisenhower administration\u2019s extension of Social Security to 10 million more workers and benefits hikes for 6.5 million Americans. On refugees, the platform spotlighted the administration\u2019s work in sponsoring the Refugee Relief Act \"to provide asylum for thousands of refugees, expellees and displaced persons,\" promising its \"wholehearted support\" for additional efforts. M. Christine Anderson, a Xavier University historian, noted that many refugees were coming from communist countries in Eastern Europe, so this wasn't an especially controversial issue during the Cold War era. On the minimum wage, the platform notes that the Eisenhower administration raised the minimum wage for more than 2 million workers. It urged extending minimum-wage protections \"to as many more workers as is possible and practicable.\" On improving the unemployment benefit system, the 1956 platform touted the administration\u2019s actions to bring unemployment insurance to 4 million additional workers, and backed efforts to \"improve the effectiveness of the unemployment insurance system.\" On strengthening unions, the platform says the \"protection of the right of workers to organize into unions and to bargain collectively is the firm and permanent policy of the Eisenhower Administration.\" That\u2019s full-throated rhetoric in support of unions -- but the policy reality is a bit more nuanced, said Jennifer Delton, a Skidmore College historian and author of Rethinking the 1950s. The platform did not support unions\u2019 key agenda item that year -- a repeal of states\u2019 ability to pass \"right to work\" laws that would ban compulsory union membership. On equal pay for equal work regardless of sex, the platform says the Eisenhower administration will \"continue to fight \u2026 (to) assure equal pay for equal work regardless of sex.\" What the 2012 platform says The party\u2019s 2012 platform is pretty different, both in tone and substance. On federal assistance to low-income communities, the 2012 platform takes a much more skeptical view. \"The federal government\u2019s entire system of public assistance should be reformed to ensure that it promotes work,\" the 2012 platform says, arguing that the system has become overly bureaucratized and discourages work. The 2012 platform also takes a shot at federal low-income housing policy, saying the government \"has spent billions more on poorly designed and ineffective housing assistance programs.\" On Social Security, the platform says current retirees or those approaching retirement should continue to receive Social Security as currently configured. However, it goes on to say that demographic and financial challenges mean that the program is \"long overdue for major change, not just another legislative stopgap that postpones a day of reckoning,\" including the possibility of \"personal investment accounts as supplements to the system.\" The 2012 platform doesn\u2019t address refugees specifically, but it does address immigration. It criticizes President Barack Obama for creating \"a backdoor amnesty program unrecognized in law (and) granting worker authorization to illegal aliens.\" It also says that \"granting amnesty only rewards and encourages more law-breaking,\" and it promises to \"create humane procedures to encourage illegal aliens to return home voluntarily, while enforcing the law against those who overstay their visas.\" The 2012 platform doesn\u2019t mention the minimum wage specifically, but it does place an emphasis on free-market business practices rather than government regulation of labor markets, laying the blame for the nation\u2019s weak economic recovery on \"unprecedented uncertainty in the American free enterprise system due to the overreaching policies of the current administration.\" Even accounting for the nuances of the 1956 platform, the clearest contrast between the two platforms may be in their approach to labor unions. The 2012 platform offers no rhetorical niceties, accusing the Obama administration of \"clinging to antiquated notions of confrontation and concentrating power in the Washington offices of union elites\" and of turning the National Labor Relations Board into \"a partisan advocate for Big Labor, using threats and coercion outside the law to attack businesses.\" The 2012 platform doesn\u2019t mention two of the meme\u2019s seven items from 1956 -- unemployment benefits and equal pay for women. The bottom line, then, is that on most of these issues, the GOP moved to the right between 1956 and 2012, though the degree of that shift has varied somewhat issue by issue. What historians say We asked scholars whether the contrast between the two platforms is noteworthy, and they generally agreed that it was. Delton noted that the Republican Party in the 1950s was divided between moderates (including Eisenhower) and conservatives. She said the moderates controlled the process of platform-writing in 1956, but they threw a few bones to conservatives in certain portions of the document. For instance, the platform said the government wouldn\u2019t sign a treaty or enter into an international agreement in violation of individual rights -- an issue that continues to energize conservatives decades later -- and there\u2019s a plank about a balanced budget, which was seen as a conservative position. The seven items listed in the meme were supported by moderates, Delton said. At the time, she said, \"conservatives would have focused, with horror, on the very items the meme highlights.\" Eisenhower was facing a Democratic Congress in 1956 and didn\u2019t want to try to reverse the New Deal, Anderson said. \"If the point is that Eisenhower was not as extreme as Republicans today, it is accurate.\""

    "justification": "The label \"False\" is appropriate for the claim made by Vice President Mike Pence during his remarks in Dallas on February 17, 2018. The evidence provided in the article contradicts Pence's statement that along the southern border of the U.S., the government apprehends seven individuals a day who are either known or suspected terrorists.\n\nFirstly, the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center defines a \"known terrorist\" as an individual who has been arrested, charged or convicted in the U.S. or abroad of a crime related to terrorism or terrorist-related activities, or a person identified as a terrorist or member of a terrorist organization \"pursuant to statute, executive order, or international legal obligation pursuant to a United Nations Security Council resolution.\" The article does not provide any evidence to support the claim that seven individuals a day are being apprehended as known terrorists at the southern border.\n\nSecondly, the article states that a \"suspected terrorist\" is an individual who is reasonably suspected to have engaged in or currently or about to be engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism and/or terrorist activities.\" Again, there is no evidence provided to support the claim that seven individuals a day are being apprehended as suspected terrorists at the southern border.\n\nThirdly, the article provides data on the number of individuals apprehended by the government along the U.S.-Mexico border in 2018, which breaks down to approximately 1,155 apprehensions per day. However, this data does not include counts of deterred or detained terrorists or suspected terrorists, as noted by Alex Nowrestah, an analyst for the Cato Institute.\n\nLastly, the article provides an alternate claim that supports a seven-a-day calculation, based on a report released by the Justice Department and Homeland Security in 2018. According to the report, Homeland Security \"had 2,554 encounters with individuals on the terrorist watch list (also known as the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Database) traveling to the United States,\" which breaks down to seven individuals a day. However, this data also does not provide evidence to support the claim that seven individuals a day are being apprehended at the southern border.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that Vice President Mike Pence's claim of seven individuals a day being apprehended as known or suspected terrorists at the southern border is false.",
    "doc": "Vice President Mike Pence says terrorists are getting caught at the U.S.-Mexico border day after day. In his Feb. 17, 2018, remarks in Dallas, Pence mentioned his visit the day before to the port inside the Hidalgo-Reynosa International Bridge in Hidalgo, a border town in Texas\u2019 Rio Grande Valley. \"We\u2019ve made progress but we still have work to do,\" Pence said. According to the White House transcript, Pence went on: \"I learned yesterday at the Hidalgo border center that along the southern border of the United States, we actually still apprehend 1,100 individuals a day, who are attempting to enter this country illegally, including seven individuals a day who are either known or suspected terrorists.\" \"So men and women, let me say, we\u2019re going to continue to work to secure our borders,\" Pence said next. \"We\u2019re going to reform a broken immigration system. And make no mistake about it, we\u2019re going to build that wall,\" Pence said to applause. We sought to verify Pence\u2019s declaration that seven suspected or known terrorists are daily getting nabbed at the border. The FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center says in a FAQ last updated in January 2017 that a \"known terrorist\" is an individual who\u2019s been arrested, charged or convicted in the U.S. or abroad of a crime related to terrorism or terrorist-related activities--or a person identified as a terrorist or member of a terrorist organization \"pursuant to statute, executive order, or international legal obligation pursuant to a United Nations Security Council resolution.\" A suspected terrorist, the FBI says, is an individual reasonably suspected to have engaged in or currently or about to be engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism and/or terrorist activities. Total apprehensions in border region We didn\u2019t draw fresh information when we asked the White House about the basis of Pence\u2019s reference to border apprehensions. Separately, Carlos Diaz, a Customs and Border Protection spokesman, suggested that we review that agency\u2019s latest counts of individuals apprehended by the government along the U.S.-Mexico border. In January 2018, the month before Pence spoke, CBP says, 35,822 individuals were apprehended in the Southwest Border region, which takes in the more than 2,000 miles from Brownsville, Texas, to San Diego. That breaks out to 1,155 apprehended people a day. No data for terrorists apprehended at border Best we could tell, though, the statistics pointed out by Diaz don\u2019t include counts of deterred or detained terrorists or suspected terrorists--a judgment shared, when we asked for help, by Alex Nowrestah, an analyst for the Cato Institute, which published a 2016 paper finding that foreign-born terrorists who entered the country, either as immigrants or tourists, were responsible for 88 percent (or 3,024) of the 3,432 murders caused by terrorists on U.S. soil from 1975 through the end of 2015. By email, Nowrestah told us he was unaware of statistics supporting Pence\u2019s seven-a-day statement about the U.S.-Mexico border. Generally, Nowrestah suggested we attempt our own ballpark estimate starting from a Department of Homeland Security table tallying \"aliens\" apprehended nationally in 2016 (the latest year of compiled data) by countries of origin--putting our focus on the number of individuals stopped from entering from countries that President Donald Trump seeks to bar U.S. visitors. Taking this approach, we found that 211 of the people apprehended in 2016 hailed from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen (with no one apprehended from another travel-ban country, North Korea)--less than a person a day. An alternate claim Another expert helped us identify aseven-a-day claim that has factual footing. By email, David Sterman, an analyst with the New America think tank, which has compiled information on terrorist activities in the United States after 9/11, pointed out that in January 2018, the Justice Department and Homeland Security released a report supporting a seven-a-day calculation. A government press release and the report itself each say that in 2017, Homeland Security \"had 2,554 encounters with individuals on the terrorist watch list (also known as the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Database) traveling to the United States,\" which breaks out to seven individuals a day. Pence made such a statement during his visit to Hidalgo, according to a McAllen Monitor news story on his visit. The story quoted the vice president saying: \"Homeland Security, I am told, refuses entry to seven known or suspected individuals who may have terrorist intent in this country every day, or roughly 2,500 a year.\" The 2018 report says: \"Where consistent with the law, such individuals are denied entry into the United States, while in some cases law enforcement authorities are notified and can take appropriate action.\" The report further says: \"This data only includes individuals of which the United States encountered and not all of those who may have entered or attempted to enter the country undetected.\" Most stopped at airports? In Dallas, Pence said the seven daily apprehensions were taking place along the southern border. But in 2017, according to the report, most of the deterred individuals were stopped from entering by airplane--not necessarily at the border. According to the report, of the 2,554 individuals, 335 were attempting to enter by land, 2,170 were attempting to enter by air and 49 were attempting to enter by sea. Also by email, Sterman cautioned that being on a watch list \"is not the same as being a terrorism suspect. It\u2019s a vast architecture that includes many names for varying levels of concern. Denying entry is a low bar to clear. Which is part of the reason citing this number to defend the immigration-centric counterterrorism strategy is misleading. It\u2019s more of a sign that a lot is already done.\" We sought the FBI\u2019s comment on whether people on the watch list consists of known terrorists and suspected terrorists and didn\u2019t immediately hear back."

    "doc": "The Department of Health estimates about 8,000 people in the state are in treatment for opioid use disorder. The state has had wait times for treatment off and on for more than five years and has struggled to ensure that professionals can meet the demand. During his successful re-election campaign, Republican Gov. Phil Scott touted his administration's overwhelming success in fighting opioid addiction. \"We had a waiting list (for drug treatment) in Chittenden County when I came into office of about 700,\" Scott said at a gubernatorial debate in Rutland last month. \"We opened a new treatment hub in St. Albans, and it reduced that number to zero.\" That gave us pause \u2013 did waitlists for treatment in Chittenden plummet from 700 to zero during Scott\u2019s tenure? We asked the campaign for evidence to back up the candidate\u2019s claims, but we never heard back. The Vermont Department of Health, however, closely tracks waitlists at the state\u2019s six \"hubs,\" the regional centers where people addicted to opioids can get high-intensity medication-assisted treatment. State data indicates the governor is off on the original waitlist number \u2013 by several hundred. In January 2017, when Scott took office, there were 145 people on hub waitlists statewide, and only 134 on the waitlist for the Chittenden hub. Hubs are the lynchpin of Vermont\u2019s hub-and-spoke drug treatment model. Drug treatment is typically initiated at hubs, where people suffering from opioid abuse disorder can get daily doses of their medication, along with counseling and referrals to social services. Less intensive services are provided at so-called \"spokes,\" a collection of about 90 providers made up of doctor\u2019s offices and community clinics, where patients can get follow-up care. The numbers tracked by the state do show a precipitous decline in waitlists at hubs since 2017. In fact, in 2018, there were no waitlists for treatment at any hubs in March, May, June, July and August, the last month for which data is available. In Chittenden County, the state hasn\u2019t counted a single person on a waitlist at the Howard Center\u2019s Chittenden Clinic, the regional hub for Chittenden and Addison counties, from September 2017 to August 2018, except for one blip in April 2018, when two people were on the waitlist. Dana Poverman, the director of Medication Assisted Treatment at the Howard Center Chittenden Clinic, said the number on the waitlist is still zero. \"We\u2019ve really come a long way in terms of access to medicine-assisted treatment,\" she said. That\u2019s thanks in large part, Poverman said, to the opening of the state\u2019s sixth hub in St. Albans and a dramatic increase in spoke providers. Less is known about what waitlists look like at Vermont\u2019s spokes. The state doesn\u2019t formally track how many people might be waiting for treatment from providers. Beth Tanzman, the executive director of the Blueprint for Health, which oversees the spokes, says the state has \"a pretty good sense of what access looks like\" through regular check-ins. \"Our understanding right now is that we are able to get everyone into care easily within 72 hours,\" she said. In Chittenden County, people are typically able to access same-day treatment, Tanzman said. In Middlebury and Springfield, where there is a dearth of spoke providers, immediate care is more difficult to obtain."

We\u2019ll start with the first claim. Cuts for children Multiple calls to the National Republican Senatorial Committee went unreturned, so we are left to assume that the reference to Strickland cutting funds for children\u2019s services is about his proposed budget in 2009. As governor from 2007 until 2011, the worst years of the national economic downturn, Strickland was faced with a $3.2 billion budget hole. The Columbus Dispatch reported that Strickland\u2019s 2009 budget proposal \"would cut out state aid to food pantries, slash funding to community health centers, abolish the state preschool program for poor youngsters and reduce eligibility for state-subsidized child care.\" The planned cuts were met with instant backlash, the Dispatch reported. In its final form, the budget resulted in less funding for services for low-income families, the disabled, Medicaid recipients and public libraries. But thanks to federal stimulus money, funding for education actually increased. It also allocated state funds for schools to provide all-day kindergarten. $250,000 bathroom remodel The \"Flush\" ad states that Strickland wasted a quarter of a million dollars remodeling his bathrooms at the governor\u2019s mansion in suburban Bexley, Ohio, outside Columbus. But as it turns out, those toilets weren\u2019t for Strickland or his family at all. They were built in the carriage house that borders the Heritage Garden on the property, apart from the main residence. According to an Associated Press story in the Logan Daily News, the new public toilets were constructed to serve the busloads of tourists who come to see the mansion -- an estimated 20,000 visitors a year. \"They are funded by private donations and $263,000 in taxpayer money,\" the paper reported. The expenditure wasn\u2019t initiated by Strickland, but was set aside in 2006 under the administration of Strickland\u2019s predecessor, Gov. Bob Taft. Taft\u2019s capital budget allocated $912,000 for \"Governor\u2019s Residence Renovations\" which included \"additional slate roof renovations, window well drain repairs, concrete porch replacement, and driveway and parking area surface replacement.\" PolitiFact Ohio contacted James Miller, the former state of Ohio project manager who oversaw the governor\u2019s residence, its staff, and all capital improvement projects, including the bathroom renovation in the carriage house. (Miller, retired after 30 years of managing government properties, now charters fishing tours on Lake Erie.) Miller said that before the five unisex bathrooms were constructed, tourists had to go into the main house and wait in line to use the restroom, often after long bus trips. The construction of the bathrooms included \"green\" features like solar panels and geothermal piping, and were built to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act for handicapped access, Miller said. More than half of the price tag for the restroom renovation -- $171,840 -- came from funding through the Americans with Disabilities Act. The other $95,695.70 was from the fund Taft established for governor\u2019s residence improvements. Miller laughed at the picture the \"Flush\" ad paints of Strickland frittering away money on luxuries because he knew him as a \"real frugal man\" who got rid of the chef who worked at the governor's mansion. Strickland did change one part of the master bathroom in the governor\u2019s residence, Miller said. He painted it. \"He did it himself,\" Miller said, \"believe me.\""

The supporting article text provides evidence from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that indicates that raising the minimum wage would increase the net income of those living at or below the federal poverty level by $5 billion, which is enough to move nearly a million people above the poverty threshold.

    "doc": "The minimum wage is one area where Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes has gone on the offensive against Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell in Kentucky\u2019s race for U.S. Senate. Grimes, now the Kentucky secretary of state, backs a Democratic effort to raise it to $10.10 an hour. In the Oct. 13 Kentucky Senate debate, McConnell, running for a sixth term in office, explained his opposition to raising the minimum wage by claiming that a Congressional Budget Office report says \"you will destroy between half a million and 1 million jobs (by raising the federal minimum wage).\" \"That\u2019s not the way to grow our economy,\" he added. But Grimes retorted that McConnell was cherry-picking data from the report. \"The full story of the CBO report is it would help lift a million \u2014 over a million \u2014 Americans out of poverty,\" she said. We looked at McConnell\u2019s assertion in a separate fact-check and said it was Mostly True. The report said job losses would likely range from \"a very slight reduction in employment\" to 1 million, with a mid-range estimate of 500,000. But what did the CBO say about the other side the ledger, the people who would be boosted out of poverty by a minimum wage hike? We decided to take a look. President Barack Obama has called on Congress to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 by 2016. In the succeeding years, increases to the minimum wage would be tied to inflation. There are 23 states with minimum wages already above the federal minimum wage, while the remainder of the country (including Kentucky) either sets the minimum wage at $7.25, links the state minimum wage to the federal amount or specifies no minimum wage at all. Eight states have minimum wages set to increase to at least $10, but in most cases that would not happen until later than 2016. So this increase, if passed, would affect most of the country. In 2016, the federal poverty level is expected to be $24,100 for a family of four. By the CBO\u2019s estimate, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would increase the net income of those living at or below the federal poverty level by $5 billion. That\u2019s enough to move 900,000 of approximately 45 million people living below the federal poverty level above that threshold. But it\u2019s not quite what Grimes said. While she initially said \"a million Americans\" she quickly corrected herself to say raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would lift \"over a million Americans out of poverty.\" The actual figure is close to a million, but definitely not \"over\" it. Grimes\u2019 campaign told us after the debate that the candidate misspoke both times and meant to say \"nearly a million.\" The CBO estimate of 900,000 people is a net figure. That means it factors in not only the people who would move above the poverty line if the minimum wage went up to $10.10 an hour, but also those who would move below it. How would someone move below the poverty line if the minimum wage went up? As we noted earlier, the CBO estimates that somewhere between a few people and a million people could lose their jobs as a result of a minimum wage hike. Some businesses might have to cut back on employees to pay the increased wages of other workers, which could have a ripple effect on the economy resulting in about 500,000 lost jobs by the end of 2016. So, it\u2019s possible that more than 900,000 people would be lifted out of poverty, it\u2019s just that some of them are offset by people moving into poverty as a result of the increase in the minimum wage. The CBO report does not say how many of the 500,000 lost jobs would move people into poverty, and it\u2019s presumptuous to put any number on it. If one person in a family loses a job as a result of a minimum wage hike, it doesn\u2019t always mean the family is now living in poverty. The lost job could be that of a teenage child or one parent in a two-income household. And either way, the net figure \u2014 900,000 \u2014 is the most important number that tells the full story. Overall, Grimes is right that there\u2019s another side to the CBO report that McConnell\u2019s comments do not highlight. As the report noted: \"The increase in the minimum wage would have two principal effects on low-wage workers: The large majority would have higher wages and family income, but a much smaller group would be jobless and have much lower family income.\""

This suggests that the deduction is widely used by Texans and has a significant impact on their federal taxes.\n\nThirdly, the article cites a statement by Texas tax expert Dick Lavine who notes that the deduction only helps taxpayers who itemize deductions, and that Texans at higher income levels disproportionately enjoy the deduction. This suggests that the deduction has a greater impact on higher-income earners, who are more likely to itemize their deductions.\n\nFinally, the article provides an estimate of the total amount of money saved by Texans over the past decade using the sales tax deduction, based on IRS data. This estimate ranges from $3.2 billion in 2004, the first year the deduction was restored, to nearly $40 billion over the entire decade.\n\nBased on these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim made by Rep. Brady is accurate. The evidence suggests that the sales tax deduction has saved Texans billions of dollars in federal taxes over the past decade, with the exact amount likely to be between $10 and $10.8 billion.",
    "doc": "A declaration about how Texans have benefited from a federal tax deduction led Austin economist Stuart Greenfield to call for the Texas Truth-O-Meter. Greenfield asked us about the accuracy of a statement by U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Houston, in a Dec. 17, 2014, press release issued after the U.S. Senate agreed with the House to extend the ability of Texas taxpayers to deduct sales taxes on federal income tax returns. Brady, a senior member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said: \"Texas families have kept more than $10 billion in their family budgets since we successfully fought to restore Texas' sales tax deduction a decade ago.\" Greenfield speculated the $10 billion figure was an overstatement. Congressman\u2019s back-up information To our inquiry, Brady spokeswoman Tracee Evans pointed out a news story posted online Sept. 22, 2014, by the Dallas Morning News. That story said that according to the Texas state comptroller\u2019s office, if Congress failed to extend the option of deducting state and local sales taxes, Texans would owe an extra $1.2 billion to the IRS in April 2015. Evans emailed us: \"If it\u2019s $1.2 billion a year, extrapolate that over ten years and what do you get?\" In most states, the News\u2019 story noted, taxpayers can deduct state income tax payments from their federal tax bill. And since 2004, Congress has let taxpayers in states with no income tax \u2014 Texas and six others \u2014 deduct state and local sales taxes instead. In 2012, the story said, 2.3 million Texas filers (about one in five) used the sales tax deduction with the average deduction for those who claimed it being $1,906, according to a September 2014 Pew Charitable Trusts report. We asked the comptroller\u2019s office about the cited estimate. By phone, spokesman Chris Bryan said its revenue-estimating experts reached the $1.2 billion figure by taking the total amount deducted by Texans for sales tax in 2012 -- $4,353,996,000 -- and multiplying that by what its experts calculated to be the average marginal tax rate that year, 27 percent. So, the calculation suggests, Texans who took the deduction in 2012 reduced their federal income taxes by an estimated $1.18 billion all together. (We ran the same numbers, starting from an IRS chart showing federal taxes paid by Texas residents in 2012, reaching the same result.) In October 2007, Evans pointed out, State Comptroller Susan Combs estimated the deduction was saving Texans $1 billion a year. Bryan told us, though, the office doesn\u2019t routinely estimate the effect of the deduction and doesn\u2019t have a 10-year impact figure. Greenfield, apprised of the comptroller\u2019s approach, said its methodology and Brady\u2019s cumulative figure seemed to add up after all. Texas tax expert: Beneficiaries tend to be higher-income earners Separately, Dick Lavine, a tax analyst for the liberal Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, stressed by email that Texans at higher income levels disproportionately enjoy the deduction, which only helps taxpayers who itemize deductions. In 2012, 39 percent of Texas filers with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 to $100,000 took the deduction; 14 percent of filers with earnings of $25,000 to $50,000 did so. Lavine pointed out, too, that Texans deducted $3.2 billion in 2004, the first year the deduction was restored, which might indicate the value of the deduction in reduced taxes over 10 years might be less than $10 billion, he said, especially if the marginal tax rate on average was 25 percent. PolitiFact estimate To reach a savings estimate of our own, we added up all the sales tax deductions claimed by Texas residents for 2004 through 2012, as reported by the IRS. A figure for 2013 has yet to be posted by the agency so we reached an estimate for that year based on averaging what Texans deducted in 2010, 2011 and 2012. All this ultimately led us to estimate the Texas deductions over the decade totaled nearly $40 billion. Next, we calculated the likely tax savings -- that is, money not paid by Texas residents to Uncle Sam thanks to these deductions. Assuming the 27 percent marginal tax rate applied by the comptroller\u2019s office to 2012, the deduction would have left $10.8 billion in Texas pocketbooks over the 10 years. At a 25 percent marginal rate, Texans\u2019 money not spent on federal taxes would have amounted to nearly $10 billion ($9.998 billion, by our calculation.) Asked to comment on our calculations, Alan Cole, an economist for the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation, a non-partisan tax policy research organization, emailed that he would have taken a similar tack. He also cautioned, though, that individuals who take the deduction tend to earn more and hence have higher marginal tax rates, which could justify a larger 10-year savings estimate."

The passage in Gillespie's book discusses various proposals for reforming health care under consideration at the time, but does not explicitly state that he was opposing the individual mandate. In fact, the passage suggests that he was open to the idea of using the tax code to encourage individuals to obtain health insurance.\n\nFurthermore, Gillespie's statements in interviews and op-eds support the conclusion that he did endorse an individual mandate. He specifically weighed in on the Massachusetts plan, stating that he thought the party was probably open to that kind of approach. Additionally, his spokesman acknowledged that Gillespie's mindset at the time was open to an individual mandate, while also stating that he personally thought a different approach was better.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is reasonable to label Ed Gillespie's 2006 book as promoting an individual healthcare mandate and recommending its enforcement through the income tax code.",
    "doc": "Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie rarely leaves a microphone without criticizing Democrat incumbent Mark Warner\u2019s 2009 vote for Obamacare. The Democratic Party of Virginia says the attacks are hypocritical, maintaining that Gillespie once embraced a policy that is at the heart of President Barack Obama\u2019s health reform law -- an individual mandate that most Americans have insurance or pay a penalty. \"Gillespie\u2019s memoir promotes an individual health care mandate, and recommends that it be enforced by the IRS through the income tax code,\" the party stated in a March 24 news release. The Democrats were pointing to words that Gillespie -- a former White House adviser and chairman of the Republican National Committee -- wrote in his 2006 book, \"Winning Right: Campaign politics and conservative policies.\" We wondered if Gillespie\u2019s memoir really did promote an individual mandate for health insurance -- the bane of many conservatives who oppose Obamacare. Under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Americans without health coverage start paying a penalty this year. By 2016, the levy grows to $2,085 per family or 2.5 percent of household income -- whichever is greater. Certain tax filers facing financial hardship and other situations are exempt. Paul Logan, Gillespie\u2019s campaign spokesman, told us in an e-mail that \"Ed never supported the individual mandate.\" Gillespie made a similar statement to the Washington Examiner last December, before he announced his candidacy. \"If I run against Sen. Warner, my critique of Obamacare will be consistent with my past positions in opposition to an individual mandate and too much government intrusion in our health care sector,\" he said. But Democrats point to a 2006 book passage in which Gillespie wrote that health care reforms should ensure that uncovered adults gain health care insurance so they won\u2019t remain \"free riders\" who get care at others\u2019 expense. \"A more rational approach is to ensure that every emancipated adult capable of providing for his or her health care do so,\" Gillespie wrote. \"One way to accomplish this is to use the tax code to gain compliance. Annual filers would have to attest that they have some form of health coverage or else the \u2018standard deduction\u2019 on their income tax would be cut in half.\" Right after this passage, Gillespie discussed another way to ensure all adults provide for their own health care. \"Another approach would be the creation of tax-free Health Savings Accounts that would be refunded after a certain period for any use,\" he wrote. \"If after seven years, an individual didn\u2019t use his HSA funds for health care, the money would be treated like an income tax refund. The inducement of tax-free savings for those who are healthy would provide an incentive for more people to obtain insurance coverage.\". We twice asked Gillespie\u2019s campaign why his suggestion to cut the standard deduction for uninsured people should not be considered support for a mandate. Logan did not provide a direct answer, saying Gillespie was writing about \"various proposals for reforming health care under consideration at the time.\" Logan also pointed us to an op-ed earlier this month in Forbes in which Merrill Matthews, a resident scholar at the conservative Institute for Policy Innovation, said the passage In Gillespie\u2019s book amounts to an \"anti-mandate approach.\" Matthews told us he \"assumed\" that Gillespie, in his 2006 book, was endorsing an unsuccessful proposal President George W. Bush made one year later offering tax breaks to insured households. Bush\u2019s \"carrot\" approach sought voluntary compliance; it did not mandate the purchase of health insurance, but would have rewarded most people who had coverage. That\u2019s different from Obama\u2019s \"stick\" approach of insisting people obtain coverage or face tax penalties. But Matthews added that the Gillespie campaign has never told him his assumption is correct and that Gillespie\u2019s language in the book is unclear. Logan also pointed to a column from the conservative National Review magazine which said \"some of the language (\u2018ensure,\u2019 compliance\u2019) sounds pro-mandate, but the actual policies described strongly resemble the proposals of the Bush administration and of Paul Ryan, which very few conservatives have described as the equivalent of a mandate.\" We spoke to two health care experts who had a different take on Gillespie\u2019s prose. Ted Marmor, a professor of health policy at Yale University, told us the policy Gillespie described is \"the functional equivalent of an individual mandate without using the words mandate and fine.\" \"Absolutely, that\u2019s an individual mandate,\" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Libertarian Cato Institute, after reading Gillespie\u2019s passage. Tanner said the passage sounds like an endorsement Massachusetts health care reforms that then-Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, signed a few months before Gillespie\u2019s book was published. The law imposed tax penalties on state residents who could afford insurance and refused to buy it. In November 2006, a few months after his book was released, Gillespie specifically weighed in on the Massachusetts plan. \"You see Mitt Romney in Massachusetts is taking some steps toward individual requirements for people to carry their own insurance. I think the party is probably open to that kind of approach,\" Gillespie told C-SPAN. \"Others are proposing small business health plans and greater transparency and putting the consumer closer in touch with the health care expenditure. I think that\u2019s a good direction.\" Logan, Gillespie\u2019s spokesman, said the interview establishes his boss\u2019s mindset: While Gillespie opined that the GOP might be open to an individual mandate, Gillespie added he personally thought a \"good direction\" was to pursue a different approach. In ensuing years, Gillespie emerged as a steadfast opponent to the individual mandate in Obamacare. In November 2009, he told ABC News that the health reform bill under consideration was a \"monstrosity\" in part because of \"the mandates in it.\" As our colleagues at PolitiFact National have reported, the individual mandate was discussed in Republican circles more than 15 years before Obamacare even existed. In 1993 some Republican senators signed onto a bill that would have required everyone to buy insurance. The legislation was an alternative to then President Bill Clinton\u2019s failed health care reform plan that required employers to pay for insurance and then closely regulated insurers and health care providers."

    "doc": "State Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, has brought back a provision of a bill vetoed by Gov. Charlie Crist in 2010 that would prohibit the use of federal or state funding to provide abortion coverage.And with the bill, he's restating a common and complicated misconception about the federal health care law -- that thebill signed into law by President Barack Obama includes taxpayer-funding for abortions.Speaking to a House subcommittee on March 16, 2011, Gaetz explained that part of the rationale behind HB 97 was to keep the government out of the business of funding elective abortions. \"I am admittedly pro-life,\" he said. \"But I would think that even for those who are pro-choice, this (elective abortions) would not be the most appropriate use of public funds.\"That's not exactly how it works, though.Abortion in the health care lawThe federal health care law -- if it withstands court challenges -- will create state-run health insurance exchanges in which private companies will compete for the business of people who do not get insurance through their employers. The idea is that it will allow individuals to get group rates enjoyed by those in big employer plans. People who cannot afford insurance will get government subsidies to offset the cost of purchasing a plan in the exchange -- a group of about 19 million people, the government estimates. The subsidy for their coverage would go directly from the government to the insurer, and look like a discount to the policy holder.How abortion would be handled as part of the health care law predictably became a thorny political issue that threatened the law's very passage, and several alternatives were considered. To pass, the health care bill had to appease anti-abortion conservative Democrats.The final language signed into law, crafted by abortion opponent Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., allows insurance companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But with a big caveat.Nelson's provision specifically prohibits the use of federal dollars to fund abortions, except in the case of rape, incest or when the mother's life in peril. Rather, insurance companies would be required to pay for abortion services from a segregated pool of money funded through patient premiums. Essentially, people who select plans that cover abortions would have to pay at least $1 a month of their premiums into a separate account. Any abortion services provided by the insurer would have to be drawn from that segregated account.On top of that, the national health care law gives states an opt-out of abortion coverage altogether. States could pass laws to prohibit abortion coverage in health plans offered on the state exchange if they chose.That's what Gaetz's HB 97 attempts to do.Section 1 of Gaetz's bill states, \"A health insurance policy or group health insurance policy purchased in whole or in part with state or federal funds through an exchange created pursuant to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may not provide coverage for an (elective) abortion... A policy is deemed to be purchased with state or federal funds if it is a policy toward which any tax credit or cost-sharing credit is applied.\"The language is identical to a provision inserted into HB 1143, which also would have required most women to have an ultrasound performed before having an abortion. That bill was vetoed by Crist.The rhetoric on this issue can be tricky.The federal law allows tax dollars to subsidize someone's policy even if the individual chooses a plan that covers abortion. So it would certainly be fair to say that many women who cannot currently afford health insurance will be given tax subsidies, and many of them may choose plans that offer abortion services. (But then the lawsays that states can opt out from that).But it's not fair to say that taxpayers are paying for elective abortions. Any abortions would be paid through a separate account funded entirely through a portion of premiums paid by people who select a plan that covers abortion services, not from tax dollars. That's an important difference. Everyone who buys into a plan that covers abortion would have to pay into that abortion fund, even men. And for those with moral objections to paying a portion of their premiums for abortion services, the federal law requires that every region offer at least one alternative health plan that does not cover abortion.During the March 16 hearing on Gaetz's bill, Rep. Lori Berman, D-Boca Raton, said the bill was unnecessary because \"there is no public funding of abortion right now.\" Berman offered an amendment to keep abortion services a part of at least one plan created by the exchange, but the amendment failed.In an interview later, Gaetz said his bill is attempting to close a loophole that could allow taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion coverage. He noted that policy holders stillwouldhave the ability to purchase optional, additional coverage for abortions."

    "doc": "Facing a backlash from teachers and parents over standardized tests, state legislators are discussing whether to pare down the hours students spend on testing. The latest batch of criticism about Florida\u2019s tests coincides with a national discussion about Common Core state standards. One of the potential GOP presidential contenders, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, has long defended the need to use tests to make schools accountable -- a position increasingly at odds with other GOP presidential contenders. The Florida Badass Teachers Association, which is part of a national association that formed in recent years in an effort to fight back against testing, raised concerns about the tests as they planned to protest Bush\u2019s Feb. 10 speech in Tallahassee. Thomas James, an association spokesman and Miami-Dade history teacher, leveled many criticisms of Florida schools, including this one in a statement provided to the Miami Herald before Bush\u2019s speech. \"Florida public school students have become little more than \u2018test drones\u2019 being bombarded with an array of standardized high stakes tests which eat up as much as 45 school days per year,\" James said. James\u2019 claim about the amount of days eaten up by tests caught our eye because it was more than double the number we heard from state legislative leaders in 2013 -- though Florida has made changes to tests since that time. How many days a year do students actually take standardized tests? Backlash over Florida\u2019s new tests We found no simple answer to that question because it varies widely depending upon students\u2019 grades, courses and district and other factors. Testing of Florida students hasalways faced some criticism but changes to those tests resulted in a fresh round of backlash within the past year. This year, students will start taking the Florida Standards Assessments aligned to Florida's new education benchmarks, based on the Common Core State Standards. (After the Common Core drew increasingly vocal criticism, the Florida Legislature last year renamed them the Florida Standards with some tweaks.) During his 2014 re-election campaign, Gov. Rick Scott promised to investigate the state testing program and the state expects to have a report ready for the beginning of the legislative session March 3. James told PolitiFact Florida that he arrived at his claim in part through a bill proposed in February by Senate Education Chairman John Legg, R-Trinity. That bill would require that students spend no more than 5 percent of school hours taking statewide and district-mandated tests. But that adds up to 45 hours -- not days -- of tests. How many hours do students take tests? The Florida Standards Assessments include reading tests in grades 3 through 11, math tests in grades 3 through 8, and science tests in grades 5 and 8. High school students must take six end-of-course exams in subjects including math and history, for example. For example, fourth-graders take 1.5 hours of tests in english language arts, 2.67 hours in writing and 2.67 hours in math. That adds up to just under seven hours of tests. The hours spent on statewide tests grew between the 2013-14 and 2015-16 school year. For example, fourth-graders now spend about one extra hour on such tests while a sixth-grader spends nearly three extra hours on tests. In high school, students take several more hours of tests. For example, a high school student may take 13 hours of statewide tests including language arts, math, biology and history. And then there are the district-wide tests. Some school districts also give their own district-wide exams that are not required by the state, usually to see how students are progressing in any given subject. We interviewed spokespersons in a few school districts to get information about the number of hours their students spend taking standardized tests. Miami-Dade school officials concluded that the maximum example would be for an 11th-grader who takes all required tests and two international baccalaureate (or \"IB\") classes which would add up to about 44 hours. In Pasco County, the typical student on average takesstate and districtwide tests for anywhere from three to 26 hours. (This does not include the IB example cited by Miami-Dade.) James told PolitiFact Florida that the Miami-Dade testing calendar shows that testing gears up in March and high schools continue testing nearly through the end of May. But not every student is taking every test throughout that two-month stretch of tests -- and some days they are taking a test for just part of that day. (The Miami Herald wrote in September that only eight out of 180 days on the district\u2019s calendar had no standardized tests, but any individual student would be tested on only a fraction of those days.) Asked about the claim of having testing on as many as 45 days, James said, \"That would be the worst-case scenario.\" We should note that even for students who are not taking a test on a particular day or portion of a day, they still could be impacted in some way by the tests. For example, their teachers may be taken out of class to proctor other students taking tests. In May 2014 the Miami Herald reported that some classes at Dr. Michael Krop High School -- James\u2019 school -- were watching movies, such as Frozen, or playing board games during such testing days. But we found no solid evidence to show the extent of students being displaced by other students taking tests. And in any case, this would vary district to district, school to school and grade to grade. How many hours each district spends on testing will become more clear when the Department of Education releases its report during the session. Still, Legg said there isn\u2019t evidence that students are spending 45 days on tests. \"It is very plausible that those students are doing 45 hours,\" Legg said. However, \"I would find it impossible to do 45 complete days.\" The Florida Education Association, the union that represents teachers, argues that the number of days devoted to tests is even higher than what James stated and can reach 60 to 80 days. But the FEA counts any day during which a student takes a test for part of the day as a \"testing day,\" and it also includes days when students are in training to use the computers to take the tests. The FEA also points to tests only taken by a fraction of students -- for example, schools whose performance is rated \"D\" or \"F,\" which have to take progress monitoring assessments that higher-rated schools do not. Ruth Haseman Melton, the director of government relations for the Florida School Boards Association, calls James\u2019 statement an oversimplification. An entire day may not be eaten up by tests, but more time is eaten up by tests beyond just the minutes a student takes them. \"It\u2019s not accurate to count the number of days that tests are given, but it\u2019s also not accurate to just count the time it takes to administer the actual test,\" which is what DOE and Senator Legg are suggesting,\" she said."

Additionally, the article explains that the volatility in the individual market is due to policyholders moving between employer coverage, rather than insurers canceling plans as Jones suggested. Therefore, the evidence provided undermines Jones' claim and justifies the label \"Conflicting\".",
    "doc": "Opponents of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law are quick to evoke the plight of potentially millions of Americans getting hit by cancellation notices from their health insurance companies due to new coverage requirements under the Affordable Care Act. All of a sudden, Republican critics sound like members of the consumer-first \"party of Ralph Nader,\" quipped Van Jones, the Democratic co-host of CNN\u2019s Crossfire, during a panel discussion on ABC\u2019s This Week. \"They're the biggest consumer protection operation in the world now, but six months ago we had people who were getting these same cancellation notices and the Republican Party was silent,\" he said. \"There's a problem when you're indifferent to the losers the last time. I want to make one thing perfectly clear. You look at the numbers here. Fourteen percent, only 14 percent of Americans were able to keep these individual market plans for two years before.\" Is his figure about the volatile individual market accurate? First, understand that consumers who seek health insurance coverage on their own are not the norm in this country. Most people are covered by their employer or Medicaid or Medicare. Another 16 percent are uninsured. About 6 percent, or 15 million Americans, are in the individual marketplace, which will be the most affected by the new law. That was intentional. After the show, Jones told PunditFact that the individual marketplace is a \"wild, wild west\" where people were denied coverage for pre-existing conditions and policyholders were continually dropped by insurers offering thin, sketchy coverage. The people in this unstable market are a transient bunch, signing 12-month contracts with insurers as they move between jobs or lose coverage they once had. When their contract is up, the insurer can discontinue a policy or change it. If they end it, federal law says they have to give policyholders 90 days notice and the choice to sign up for different coverage. \"Current policyholders are not having their current policy canceled \u2013 rather, the insurance company is exercising its option to discontinue the policy at the end of the contract year,\" according to Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. And now, if healthcare.gov straightens out, they can purchase new coverage there. The health care law\u2019s authors wanted to make sure people in the individual marketplace had access to the same standardized coverage as everyone else. As a result, new policies created after the health care law passed in March 2010 must cover \"10 essential health benefits,\" such as preventive care, ambulatory service, and maternity and newborn care. Because many of these individual plans don\u2019t offer that, and they weren\u2019t eligible to be \"grandfathered\" under the new law, the insurers are shedding some of them. It\u2019s a lot to take in, but it\u2019s all part of the complicated before-and-after picture that Jones was trying to paint for viewers about the benefits of the much-maligned health care law. As for his stat that \"only 14 percent of Americans were able to keep these individual market plans for two years\" before the health care law, Jones told us he was a little off. He meant to say 17 percent, a reference to a finding in a 2004 study published in the journal Health Affairs that was recently highlighted in a Washington Post explainer about the policy cancellations. The study examined coverage patterns in the individual insurance marketplace from 1996-2000 -- quite some time ago. The key finding for our purposes is this: \"Roughly one-sixth (17 percent) of those with individual insurance coverage retained it for more than two years.\" The reason? Not because of insurers canceling plans like Jones suggested. Though insurers do cancel coverage, the study determined that most of the volatility with enrollment and dropped policies had to do with policyholders moving between employer coverage, with a median enrollment length of eight months. The people who kept their insurance the longest were small business employees or self-employed, the study found. So Jones is close on the number. But Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee law professor, says the number does not exactly mean what Jones said it does. Jones is saying it\u2019s the fault of insurance companies that most people could not hold onto their coverage, but the reality is less known. It\u2019s probably not accurate to pin it all on insurers canceling the plans, Jost said, though no one knows for sure how much of the churning has to do with insurers and people canceling their plan or choosing a new one. \"He does have a point, but I wouldn\u2019t have said it that way,\" Jost said. \"It\u2019s a market that has just not functioned very well. ... It\u2019s long been the case that people just come and go from the market all the time.\" Other health policy experts found Jones\u2019 remarks confusing. Yes, the market tends to be volatile due to high administrative costs and the inability to pool risk among healthy and sick patients like large employer plans, said Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. \"Does he think Republicans should have complained about the volatility in the individual market before this? That only makes sense if they have a solution to the problem,\" she said. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius referenced another 2004 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation in an online column meant to offer some calm around the cancellation notices for individual plans. The study said about 45 percent of policies remained after two years, a much higher estimate though its sample did not include short-term health insurance policies that are often bought to cover gaps of three to six months."

    "doc": "The Republican Party of Florida is launching a pre-emptive strike against former golden boy Charlie Crist, who very well could run for governor in 2014 as a Democrat. In a new Web ad, the state GOP spoofs the History Channel with a segment called \"This Day in CRIST-ory.\" The date: May 28, 2009. (The date should be May 27, but the state GOP flubbed that.) The setting: Tallahassee. The story: Then-Republican Gov. Crist is signing a $66.5 billion budget that includes a $1-a-pack cigarette tax and higher fees on drivers licenses and motor vehicle tags. The new taxes and fees, which are estimated to generate $2.2 billion, are needed to pass a balanced state budget -- and were supported by Republicans in the Legislature -- but also break Crist\u2019s pledge not to raise taxes. \"Two weeks after signing a taxpayer protection pledge, he (Crist) breaks it!\" the Republican Party\u2019s ad exclaims. Here at PolitiFact Florida, we didn\u2019t need a history lesson to remember the basics of the 2009 budget. But we did wonder about the state GOP\u2019s assertion that Crist had the gall to break a pledge just two weeks after he signed it. Crist, it turns out, did sign a taxpayer protection pledge two weeks before signing the budget into law. We found that through a press release from \u2026 the Republican Party of Florida. At the time, Crist had recently announced he was running for the U.S. Senate, and Republicans far and wide were rallying around his candidacy. (Well, except former House Speaker Marco Rubio. That\u2019s for another day in CRIST-ory.) But the pledge Crist signed on May 14, 2009, was for federal candidates, not state ones. And it was specific to income taxes. Not taxes in general. Crist signed a pledge from the Americans for Tax Reform, a well-known anti-tax group led by Grover Norquist. In it, Crist promised to \"oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; and ... oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.\" A tax pledge yes, but one that wouldn\u2019t be broken with a tax on cigarettes or motor vehicle fees. That doesn\u2019t get Crist out of hot water, however. Crist signed another taxpayer pledge from Americans for Tax Reform in June 2005. In that pledge, Crist promised to \"oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes.\" \"Pledges are important, but actions speak louder,\" Crist said in an email to supporters in December 2005. \"Throughout my years of public service I have stood squarely against tax increases, and will continue to do so as governor.\" Crist\u2019s 2009 budget signature does appear to violate his older pledge -- particularly in allowing the $1-a-pack cigarette tax to become law. \"The cigarette tax is appropriate, and I really view it more as a health issue than I do as a tax issue,\" Crist said May 19, 2009. \"(Ronald) Reagan said when you want to kill something you ought to tax it. Well, it wouldn't be bad if you killed smoking. There are about 2 million Floridians, maybe a few less, who smoke. And it's not good for you.\" (We looked for that Reagan quote, the closest we could find was,\" Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.\") Republican Party of Florida spokesman Matt Moon admitted the mistake in the ad's phrasing. \"While it's true we should have been more precise and not used the words 'two weeks,' ... he did sign a taxpayer protection pledge that he did break,\" Moon said. \"And we're still going to call him out on it.\""

    "doc": "Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring dismisses the notion that the U.S. Senate shouldn\u2019t fill the Supreme Court vacancy before voters head to the polls in November. \"Since 1900, six (U.S. Supreme Court) justices have been confirmed during election years, including Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was confirmed in the final year of the Reagan Administration,\" Herring and fellow Democratic attorneys general wrote in a March 10 letter to U.S. Senate leaders. Herring\u2019s letter was sent less than a week before President Barack Obama nominated U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia, who died Feb. 13. We recently looked at another Herring claim that every nominee since 1875 had received a confirmation hearing, a statement we rated Mostly False. Here, we\u2019re checking to see whether the attorney general was closer to the mark when he said there have been six justices confirmed during presidential election years since the start of the 20th century. Michael Kelly, his spokesman, pointed us to several sources to back Herring\u2019s statement, including a nearly identical claim on the White House website. He also pointed us to several other sources, including an article in The New York Times about presidential election year confirmations and the U.S. Senate\u2019s historic listing of all Supreme Court vacancies. We have some familiarity with the history of presidential election year confirmations going back to 1940, because we checked a statement by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th, who claimed that was the last time the Senate confirmed a Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election year. We rated that claim Half True. Our colleagues at PolitiFact have looked at statements examining presidential year confirmations going back even further, to the early 1900s, which hews more closely to Herring\u2019s claim. We examined the record to see if Herring was correct. The first Supreme Court confirmation in a presidential election year in the 20th century occurred in 1912. President William Howard Taft nominated Mahlon Pitney in February that year, and the Senate confirmed him the following month. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis and John Clarke to the high court, and both were confirmed that year. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Cardozo to high court, and the Senate confirmed him within two weeks. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the court; the overwhelmingly Democratic-led Senate approved the choice less than two weeks later. After Murphy\u2019s elevation to the court, it would be nearly five decades before there was another justice confirmed in an election year. Anthony Kennedy, the justice Herring specifically cited in his letter, was confirmed in a 97-0 vote in the Democratically controlled Senate on Feb. 3, 1988. That was the final full year of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration. Republicans argue that Kennedy\u2019s case isn\u2019t comparable to the current Supreme Court vacancy, because Kennedy filled a seat that opened six months before the 1988 election year. Reagan initially nominated Robert Bork to fill the vacancy left by retiring Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., but the Senate rejected him in a vote that October. Reagan then announced he would nominate Douglas Ginsburg. But Ginsburg\u2019s nomination was withdrawn after he acknowledged smoking marijuana as a college student and early in his teaching career. Finally, Reagan nominated Kennedy in November 1987. Regardless of that debate, Kennedy\u2019s elevation to the court indeed did occur during an election year. We should note there have been some false starts in getting high court nominees through the Senate during a presidential election year. President Lyndon B. Johnson tried to elevate Justice Abe Fortas to chief justice and nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas\u2019 place on the bench in 1968. But both nominations fizzled after the Senate filibustered the Fortas nomination."

    "doc": "U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Palm Harbor, defended the president\u2019s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, claiming it would save millions of jobs in a letter to constituents. \"A study by the National Economics Research Association showed that the deal could cost 2.7 million lost jobs in the U.S. by 2025 should our country adhere to the commitments made by the Obama Administration,\" Bilirakis said. A reader who received the letter asked us to look into it. Would the United States have lost 2.7 million jobs had it remained in the agreement? This is a statistic President Donald Trump also cited in his speech declaring the withdrawal, but we found that the study is based on an extreme model, and its results were presented in a misleading way. Bilirakis\u2019 office directed us to Trump\u2019s announcement to withdraw from the Paris accord, citing the same study. But when we asked NERA about it, the organization forwarded the same statement they put out following Trump\u2019s speech. \"Use of results from this analysis as estimates of the impact of the Paris Agreement alone mischaracterizes the purpose of NERA\u2019s analysis, which was to explore the challenges of achieving reductions from U.S. industrial sectors over a longer term,\" it states. \"Selective use of results from a single implementation scenario and a single year compounds the mischaracterization.\" Here\u2019s why plucking the 2.7 million-lost jobs talking point is a bad idea. The study predicts the potential impact of hypothetical U.S. regulatory action to meet the carbon emission goals pledged in Paris. It was produced in March 2017 and funded by the American Council for Capital Formation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, both vocal opponents of the agreement. The loss of 2.7 million jobs economy-wide by 2025 reported in the study is contingent on \"additional regulatory actions necessary to meet the Paris target.\" But the Paris agreement does not require actions, as it was not binding, and the regulatory action mentioned has not been proposed. The study begins, then, with the assumption that regulation would expand beyond the electricity sector, which is where the Obama administration directed it. According to law professor Cary Coglianese, the director of the University of Pennsylvania Program on Regulation and author of Does Regulation Kill Jobs?, the study is a forecast based on an erroneous model. \"How accurate that forecast or any forecast will be depends upon how well the model matches reality and the world. The particular model used in that NERA analysis doesn\u2019t match up with what I think most people would recognize as the reality of the economy,\" Coglianese said. According to Gary Yohe, a professor of economics and environmental studies at Wesleyan University who worked on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that received a share of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, the model does not accurately reflect government regulation or the energy industry\u2019s reaction to market trends. \"They impose what they interpret as the effect of what the Unites States agreed to under the Paris accord,\" Yohe said, but \"they pick the least efficient way of doing it.\" The hypothetical regulations they impose are inflexible, ruling out cap-and-trade or taxes and instead set strict regulations on specific sectors. The NERA researchers acknowledged the risk of their predictions. \"The findings contained in this report may contain projections based on current data and historical trends,\" the report states. \"Actual results could be impacted by future events that cannot be predicted or controlled, including, without limitation, changes in business strategies, the development of future products and services, changes in market and industry conditions, the outcome of contingencies, changes in management, and changes in law or regulations.\" The development of future products and services, though, is precisely what the renewable energy industry is all about. But the study assumes the economy and technology will remain unchanged. \"There\u2019s no inclusion in the analysis of the growth or development of renewable energy sources, for example,\" Coglianese said. \"And one thing we know about jobs, renewable energy sources tend to result in hiring of more people and more jobs than in other parts of the energy sector.\" \"According to the U.S.Energy and Employment Report designed by the Energy Information Administration, over 373,000 Americans were employed in solar energy, while the coal industry employed about 160,000 and continued to shrink since 2012 due, in part, to competition by natural gas. So while the quote in the NERA study seems to conflate job loss with unemployment, it ignores the possibility of a changing job market in which jobs in the renewable energy industry replace jobs in the traditional fossil fuel industry that would face heavier regulation to comply with the agreement."

    "justification": "Based on the provided evidence, it can be concluded that the claim made by Governor Rick Scott that adding toll lanes on I-95 in Broward County improved rush-hour traffic for non-toll lanes from 25 mph to 45 mph is true. The evidence suggests that the express lanes created by converting high-occupancy vehicle lanes to express lanes did indeed improve traffic speeds, with southbound traffic in non-toll lanes jumping to an average of 51 mph during morning rush hour and northbound traffic sped up to 41.3 mph in the afternoon rush. These improvements are consistent with Governor Scott's claim that the express lanes benefited all drivers, not just those paying the toll.\n\nThe evidence also highlights the success of the 95 Express project in Miami-Dade County, which added new lanes to a 7.3-mile stretch of I-95 by repainting northbound and southbound lane lines. The express lanes replaced HOV lanes that were reserved for cars carrying two or more people, free of charge. The program has generated about $28 million since its debut and improved peak-period speeds, despite the caveats mentioned in the article regarding the time period and volume of vehicles using the highway.\n\nWhile there may be some debate about whether adding new lanes without tolling would have similarly improved traffic, the evidence suggests that the express lanes did lead to improved traffic speeds for non-toll lanes. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate based on the provided evidence.",
    "doc": "Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a big fan of interviews from friendly talk radio stations, used an Oct. 10, 2011, chat with a Daytona Beach host to discuss prudent investments for the state amid another big budget shortfall.(Well, after saying Florida doesn't need more anthropologists, which created an uproar within the academic community. And after disputing that he's changed how he will measure his promise to create 700,000 private-sector jobs, which PolitiFact Florida gave a full-flop. Moving on ...)Scott pointed to improving state ports in anticipation of the Panama Canal expansion, cargo rail and adding more toll roads across the state to support new construction projects. In his comments to host Marc Bernier, Scott said the state can designate toll lanes on federal highways as long as the state adds a new lane, and he cited changes to Interstate 95 as an example of how it can work well.\"We did that down in Broward County,\" he said. \"It took the rush-hour traffic for the non-tolled lanes from 25 mph to 45 (mph). So for people not paying the toll it was a big benefit. We're going to start doing that across the state.\"Scott's claim that express lanes improved rush-hour traffic for all drivers is interesting, especially given his signal that he wants to expand tolling statewide. He repeated the point a week later in an interview on Tampa Bay's WFLA-AM 970. We thought it wise to check his evidence.95 Express, a primerFirst we'll address what he's talking about, as it may not be obvious to residents outside of southeast Florida with its notoriously treacherous commutes. Scott was referring to \"95 Express,\" a Florida Department of Transportation project unveiled in December 2008 to improve traffic speeds during the morning and afternoon rush hour.He misspoke when he said the program was in Broward County. The only operational piece of the project is in Miami-Dade County.DOT workers added new lanes to a 7.3-mile stretch of I-95 by repainting northbound and, about a year later, southbound lane lines. The express lanes replaced High Occupancy Vehicle, or HOV, lanes that were reserved for cars carrying two or more people, free of charge. The HOV lanes -- one in each direction -- were not very popular.The special toll lanes, two in each direction, start at State Road 836, called the Dolphin Expressway, in Miami, and run north to the Golden Glades Interchange. The second phase, which was scheduled to begin construction in fall 2011, will extend from Golden Glades to Fort Lauderdale in Broward County.A word about the tolls: They are paid automatically via electronic transponders (SunPass) but are not charged to motorcycles, registered carpools of three or more passengers, registered hybrid vehicles, and school and transit buses. Anyone else itching to use the lane less traveled pays a fee based on \"congestion pricing,\" meaning the toll value changes with traffic load. The rate increases with demand, so drivers pay more to use the express lane when they need it most. The higher the toll, the busier the lanes.DOT keeps a weekly estimate of these rates. From Oct. 3 to Oct. 7, 2011, the toll in both lanes was 25 cents from midnight to 7 a.m. But in the southbound lane, which takes on a heavier load of morning commuters, the fee got as high as $3. Conversely, the fee peaked at $2.75 in the northbound lanes from 5 to 6 p.m.\"They opt to pay the toll because they know they're going to have a more reliable trip,\" said Brian Rick, DOT District Six spokesman.The program has generated about $28 million since its debut, he said, or about $1 million a month. That money pays for maintenance of the program and express buses that use the lanes. The first phase of construction cost about $132 million, according to the first yearly overview of the program. The second phase reaching Fort Lauderdale will cost an expected $92.7 million and be finished by 2014.The express lanes reached their peak toll of $7.10 when fans piled on the highway after an Oct. 4, 2010, Miami Dolphins-New England Patriots game. That's a pretty steep fare at $1 per mile, earning the express lanes the nickname \"Lexus lanes.\"BenefitsScott is right: converting high-occupancy vehicle lanes to express lanes speeds up traffic, the program overview shows.Traffic in both HOV and general lanes crawled below 20 mph during the morning and afternoon rush, according to a 2008 study of the HOV lanes. With the express lanes, southbound traffic in non-toll lanes jumped to an average 51 mph during morning rush hour, a 35.7 mph leap. In the northbound non-toll lanes during the afternoon rush, traffic sped up to 41.3 mph, improving by 22.5 mph.DOT puts it more simply on its website: \"With the opening of the express lanes, drivers are experiencing improved speeds above 40 MPH in the local lanes and 50 MPH in the express lanes along the northbound and southbound directions during rush hour periods.\"A few caveats about DOT's numbers. The 2008 HOV study relied on peak periods of 7 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m. In its evaluation of average speeds with 95 Express, DOT expanded the rush-hour periods by an additional hour from 6 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m. Also, the southbound toll lanes did not open until Jan. 15, 2010, halfway through the 2009-10 fiscal year during which DOT collected its speed data for both lanes.There's also the number of vehicles using the highway to consider. The program improved peak-period speeds, but did it do the same for volume?The southbound section in 2008 took on an average of 6,872 vehicles in the HOV and general purpose lanes per hour during the morning peak period. In the northbound section, the 2008 hourly peak period figure was 7,843. In 2010 (keeping in mind the caveats we mentioned before) the southbound express and general purpose lanes moved a total of about 8,916 vehicles per morning rush hour, and 7,856 vehicles per hour in the northbound section in the afternoon.DOT has not completed its fiscal year 2011 report, but project manager Rory Santana said volume is improving as peak-period speeds stay the same.In an interview, he acknowledged the argument that traffic would have improved simply because DOT created a new lane. Still, he says, if DOT had just added an extra lane without the toll lanes and congestion pricing, \"there's a very good chance that volume would have gone up right there and filled it up,\" Santana said.Scott and DOT Secretary Ananth Prasad want to expand the managed lanes program across the state. Prasad is seeking a public-private partnership to put new Express-style lanes on I-75 in Broward County, as well as adding a managed lane to Miami's Palmetto Expressway, according to an interview with the News Service of Florida."

It also does not mention a single-payer health care system.\n\nThirdly, Daniel Squadron, the executive director of Future Now, stated that his group supports universal health care but has not endorsed any specific legislation. He also noted that the GOP is distorting the truth about his group's goals to scare North Carolinians out of voting for Democrats.\n\nLastly, the NC GOP's claim that Democrats have signed a pledge to enact universal health care coverage, which would be a single-payer system, is not supported by the evidence provided. While some Democrats may have signed a pledge to work towards universal health care goals, this does not necessarily mean they support a single-payer system.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that Democrats pledged to \"force all North Carolinians into a single-payer health insurance scheme\" that would cost $72 billion is false.",
    "doc": "No matter where you live in North Carolina, you\u2019re likely to receive a political mailer about health care. Democratic candidates in North Carolina say the GOP-controlled state legislature hasn\u2019t done enough to improve health care. They say Republicans should at the very least expand Medicaid, which experts have said could help cover up to 500,000 people in the state. Republicans\u2019 main defense is that expanding Medicaid is too expensive and that Democrats want to go several steps further than that. An ad campaign by the state Republican Party says Democrats have a \"radical\" health care agenda that will \"destroy our economy, kill our jobs, take more of your hard-earned dollars in taxes, and infringe on your personal freedoms.\" The NC GOP attack on Democrats, which includes digital ads and mailers in districts across the state, is summarized onRadicalDemAgenda.com. The party has purchased internet domain names of Democratic candidates \u2014 such as JulieVonHaefen.com \u2014 to reach voters. Republican candidates are using the same messaging in ads they pay for. The GOP claim is two-pronged. First, that \"55 liberal members and candidates of the North Carolina Democratic House Caucus signed a pledge to enact an extreme, far-left healthcare agenda.\" Second, that \"part of their health care agenda is to force all North Carolinians into a single-payer health insurance scheme. The non-partisan North Carolina General Assembly Fiscal Research staff calculated it would cost North Carolina $72 billion and force all residents to give up their current health care plan.\" Did Democrats \"pledge\" to \"force\" North Carolinians into a single-payer health system that would cost $72 billion? Let\u2019s break it down. Single-payer health care The term \"single-payer\" refers to a health insurance system in which the federal government, rather than private insurers, pays all medical expenses. The NC GOP\u2019s claim about a single-payer plan refers to a bill,HB 916, introduced last year that would have studied the cost of creating a single-payer health system. Bill sponsors included House Democrats Cecil Brockman, Verla Insko, Larry Bell, Jean Farmer-Butterfield, Susan Fisher, Charles Graham, Pricey Harrison, Yvonne Holley, Garland Pierce and Bobbie Richardson. It was ignored until this June, when Republican leaders moved it into a committee. Rep. David Lewis, a Republican from Harnett County, then asked the nonpartisan fiscal research staff to calculate the cost of a single-payer health care system in North Carolina. That\u2019s when Insko moved to kill it, saying any analysis of the bill should\u2019ve been completed by the end of last year. It\u2019s also when Richardson took her name off the bill because she didn\u2019t want to be a part of the GOP\u2019s \"political game,\" according to her campaign manager, Taylor Grady-Daly. The cost of a single-payer plan would likely exceed $72 billion per year, according to legislative staff. About $30.1 billion could be paid for with federal dollars, but North Carolina would be responsible for $41.89 billion \u2014 nearly double the current general fund budget,The N&O reported. The two-page bill merely directs the legislature to study a single-payer system that its sponsors would like to implement, but the bill doesn\u2019t implement that system on its own. PolitiFact asked the fiscal research staff whether such a system would \"force\" North Carolinians into a single-payer plan. \"The Plan described in the bill does not seem to kick anyone off their current insurance, but it also says \u2018all residents shall be covered so I would expect most people would voluntarily drop their existing coverage rather than pay for double coverage,\" said David Vanderweide, a fiscal researcher for the N.C. legislature. While the bill was introduced by nine Democrats, a single-payer health care plan isn\u2019t in theN.C. Democratic Party platform, spokesman Robert Howard noted. Neither is the pledge Republicans reference, Howard added. A pledge: \u2018Universal, affordable health care\u2019 The GOP ad refers to a platform pushed by Future Now, a left-leaning advocacy group. The group has seven main goals, which are listed at FutureNow.org andAmericasGoals.org. One of the goals is \"affordable, quality healthcare.\" As part of this goal, the group wants to see \"universal, affordable health coverage with a cap on out-of-pocket expenses.\" The group thinks reaching this goal could ultimately end hunger and boost life expectancy rates to 84 years. The GOP ad mentions 55 people who signed the pledge to work toward the Future Now goals. The true number is even higher, according to Future Now spokeswoman Alyssa Cass. More than 65 House members are listed on theFuture Now website. As for the pledge, there\u2019s an important distinction to be made between single-payer health care and universal health care, said Daniel Squadron, Future Now executive director. One refers to who\u2019s paying for the coverage, while the other refers to how many people are covered. It\u2019s not fair to equate Future Now\u2019s goals with a bill exploring single-payer health care, Squadron said. Future Now supports expanding Medicaid in North Carolina but hasn\u2019t endorsed any specific legislation, Squadron said, adding that the GOP is distorting the truth about his group to scare North Carolinians out of voting for Democrats. \"I would\u2019ve thought that the idea of people across the country having access to health care wouldn\u2019t be controversial,\" he said. \"Apparently for the GOP attacking it, that\u2019s not a valuable goal worth working towards, so that\u2019s surprising and disturbing.\" Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the NC GOP, pushed back at the notion that Future Now doesn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t support a single-payer health care system. Future Now\u2019s founder, Jeffrey Sachs, wrote anop-ed for CNNadvocating for a \"Medicare for All\" system along the lines of what Sen. Bernie Sanders has proposed \u2014 a single payer plan. \"The economics of Medicare for All championed bySen. Bernie Sandersare actually quite straightforward,\" Sachs wrote. \"Under what advocates call \u2018M4A,\u2019 health care coverage would expand while total spending on health care \u2014 by companies, individuals and the government \u2014 would decline because of lower costs. More would be paid through the government and less through private insurers.\" Woodhouse noted that Squadron, for his part, praised asingle-payer health care proposalwhen he was a state senator in New York and chairman of the Senate Democratic Policy Group. Those statements by Sachs and Squadron, Woodhouse said in an email, show that Democrats \"have signed a pledge to enact universal health care coverage, which by the founders\u2019 own stated opinion would be a single-payer system. All North Carolinians would be forced through massive tax increases to pay into Insko\u2019s radical single-payer proposal.\" While Woodhouse argues the terms \"single-payer,\" \"Medicare for all\" and \"universal health care\" all mean the same thing, each term can have a different meaning. TheVox.com news site notedthat public support varies for each term. AKaiser Family Foundation pollfound a majority of respondents have favorable views of \"Medicare for all\" and \"universal health care.\" The term \"single-payer,\" which appears most often in the GOP ads, got far less support."

    "doc": "Did foreign interests curry favor with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by paying huge speaking fees to her husband? That\u2019s the question raised in the forthcoming book Clinton Cash by author and political consultant Peter Schweizer. On the Sunday shows, Schweizer said that while his research uncovered no proof of a quid pro quo between foreign interests and the 2016 Democratic frontrunner, the evidence does suggest a troubling trend. In an April 26 interview on Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace highlighted a claim from Schweizer\u2019s book. \"You have an interesting point that I want to put up on the screen that seems to demonstrate exactly the point you're making,\" Wallace said. \"Between 2001 and 2012, Bill Clinton made 13 speeches, 13, for which he was paid $500,000 or more. Eleven of those 13 speeches were at least eight years after he left the presidency while his wife was secretary of state.\" Schweizer responded, noting that Bill Clinton\u2019s speaking fees \"dramatically\" went up when Hillary Clinton, now a presidential candidate, took office in 2009. \"When you have one or two examples, it's a coincidence,\" he said. \"When you have this many, to me it's a trend.\" We aren\u2019t going to dig into the truthfulness of Schweizer\u2019s overall thesishere. But we are interested in Bill Clinton\u2019s speaking fees while Hillary Clinton was at the State Department. His book says,\"Of the 13 Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state,\" according to the New York Times, which has an advance copy. By the millions In 2014,before Clinton Cash was in the public eye,the Washington Post analyzed Clinton\u2019s speaking fees and found he made at least $104 million in speaking fees between 2001 through 2012 -- more than half of that income came from speeches in foreign countries (though he gave more speeches within the United States). To find out more about Clinton\u2019s speaking fees, we turned to Hillary Clinton\u2019s federal financial disclosure forms, made available by the Center for Responsive Politics, a research group that tracks money in politics. Because Hillary Clinton held federal positions from the time they left the White House in 2001 through 2012, her financial information as well as Bill Clinton\u2019s is available for all those years. Schweizer didn\u2019t respond to our requests for comment, but income information on the financial disclosure forms supports his claim. Here\u2019s a list of all the speeches for which Clinton received a fee of $500,000 or higher, including the year, location, host and actual fee: 2003 -- Japan, $500,000 Sakura Asset Management (Japanese finance corporation) (A note: This speech was canceled, but the fee went to Clinton\u2019s presidential library foundation); 2008 -- California, $500,000, Power Within (life coach Anthony Robbins\u2019 brand); 2010 -- Russia, $500,000,Renaissance Capital (Russian finance corporation); 2010 -- United Arab Emirates, $500,000, Novo Nordisk (Danish pharmaceutical company); 2011 -- Nigeria, $700,000, THISDAY (newspaper); 2011 -- Austria, $500,000, Center for Global Dialogue and Cooperation (Austrian nongovernmental organization); 2011 -- Netherlands, $600,000, Achmea (Dutch finance corporation); 2011 -- China, $550,000, Huatuo CEO Forum (business conference); 2011 -- United Arab Emirates, $500,000, Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative (international environmental information organization); 2011 -- Hong Kong, $750,000, Ericsson (Swedish multinational communications technology company); 2012 -- Nigeria, $700,000, THISDAY (newspaper); 2012 -- Austria, $500,000, Center for Global Dialogue and Cooperation (Austrian nongovernmental organization); 2012 -- Italy, $500,000, Technogym (fitness equipment manufacturer). So in the time Clinton left the White House in January 2001 and when his wife stepped down from secretary of state in February 2013, Clinton indeed gave 13 speeches for which he made more than $500,000. Eleven of those occurred since January 2009, when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. Only two happened before then. Schweizer suggests that Clinton\u2019s speaking fees went up in 2009 in part because companies wanted leverage within Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department. For example, New York Times reporters -- building off of Schweizer\u2019s work -- found that while the State Department was involved in securing a uranium mining deal with Russia, investors in the company involved in the deal, Uranium One, gave millions to the Clinton Foundation. Additionally, \"shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.\" The article\u2019s talking about speech No. 3 on the list above, the 2010 speech paid for by Renaissance Capital. ABC News also examined Clinton\u2019s speaking records and found many instances in which he took in money from groups with pending interests at the State Department. State Department ethics officials had to sign off on these speaking engagements, but rarely did they say Clinton could not accept payment for a particular speech. Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign has staunchly denied the implication that there was some sort of quidpro quo for entities that contributed to the Clintons\u2019 wealth, arguing that Schweizer\u2019s book does not have firm evidence of any such deal making."

    "doc": "Opposing Republican-proposed cuts in food stamps, U.S. Rep. Pete Gallego suggested the program doesn\u2019t waste money.After airing qualms about cutting \"things that work well\" during a May 15, 2013, meeting of the House Agriculture Committee, the Alpine Democrat said some government programs have high error rates, but error rates for food stamps, meaning the USDA\u2019s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, \"are only 3 percent... Ninety seven percent of SNAP benefits are paid in the proper amounts to people who are really eligible.\"Food stamps, which help beneficiaries buy groceries, often stir strong claims. In March 2013, PolitiFact in Washington rated Pants on Fire the declaration that 70 percent of the program\u2019s funding went to its employees. The broadest calculation of SNAP administrative costs topped out at 5 percent of its costs.In December 2012, PolitiFact Ohio rated as True a claim that growth in food stamp participation had trailed increases in unemployment, while in August 2012, we rated as True a claim that one in seven American families is on food stamps. According to the Agriculture Department, a record 46.6 million residents participated in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2012, up from 44.7 million the year before and 40.3 million in fiscal 2010.As of March 2013, more than 1.6 million Texas households were enrolled.Fraud concerns Food stamp fraud occasionally draws attention, too. A Feb. 6, 2012, Reuters news story quoted Kevin Concannon, U.S. Department of Agriculture undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services, as saying that fraud at that time accounted for 1 percent of food stamp benefits, while costing the government $750 million a year. \"This is $750 million that isn't being used to provide food to individuals and families, and that issue isn't lost on us,\" Concannon said.The story said the program's \"biggest step forward in fraud prevention came in 2004, when the government replaced paper coupons with plastic cards that are loaded electronically like debit cards.\" Concannon also said the program was adding high-tech strategies to its enforcement quiver, the story said, among them plans to work with social media firms and a data mining company to root out abuse. The agency has a website to solicit food-stamp fraud tips.\"While administrators work to reduce payment errors,\" the story said, \"the USDA is collaborating with state agencies to investigate recipients suspected of committing fraud or misusing benefits. It also will seek tougher penalties for stores engaged in trafficking. Trafficking generally takes the form of users \u2018selling\u2019 their benefits for roughly 50 cents on the dollar to brick-and-mortar retailers or to individuals found via websites like eBay or Facebook.\"Basis of claim Gallego\u2019s claim did not speak directly to trafficking scams. But are 97 percent of food stamp benefits paid in proper amounts to eligible residents, as he said?By email, Gallego spokeswoman Rebecca Acu\u00f1a attributed the percentage to research by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal, Washington, D.C.-based think tank. In a blog post revised May 16, 2013, the center said the House committee-approved version of the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013, which Gallego and committee members were discussing when he spoke, would cut SNAP by almost $21 billion over the next decade, eliminating food assistance to nearly 2 million low-income people, mostly working families with children and senior citizens.The center said in a May 10, 2013, blog post: \"Only 3 percent of SNAP benefits represent overpayments, meaning they either went to ineligible households or went to eligible households but in excessive amounts. SNAP achieved its lowest error rate on record in fiscal year 2011, with a national overpayment rate of just 2.99 percent (see graph). The underpayment rate that year was 0.81 percent. Thus, the net loss to the federal government \u2014 the amounts lost through over\u00adpayments minus those saved by underpayments \u2014 was only 2.2 percent.\" An accompanying graph, which we show below, was headlined: \"SNAP Error Rates Are at an All-Time Low.\"Also, the center said, relatively \"few payment errors reflect dishonesty or fraud. The overwhelming majority result from honest mistakes by recipients, eligibility workers, data entry clerks, or computer programmers. States report that almost 60 percent of the dollar value of overpayments and almost 90 percent of the dollar value of underpayments were their fault, not recipients\u2019. Much of the rest of the overpayments resulted from innocent errors by households that had trouble navigating SNAP\u2019s complex rules.\" Government dataInformation posted online by the Agriculture Department tracks with the center\u2019s blog post, stating that in the fiscal year that ran through September 2011, 2.99 percent of SNAP benefits were overpayments and 0.81 percent were underpayments. Wyoming had the highest share of overpayments that year, at 7.63 percent, and Alaska had the lowest, 0.53 percent, while 2.63 percent of SNAP payments in Texas were overpayments, according to the information.Overpayments were more prevalent in previous years, annual department reports indicate, though the incidence dropped each year after fiscal 2006, when overpayments accounted for 4.82 percent of benefits. In fiscal 2000, in contrast, SNAP overpayments accounted for 6.51 percent of its benefits. By email, Agriculture Department spokeswoman Elena Gaona told us information on overpayments of SNAP benefits in fiscal 2012 are due to be released by the end of June 2013.An independent analysis Separately, we contacted Kay Brown, an analyst who has studied the food stamp program for the General Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. Brown said by telephone that she has \"no problem\" with Gallego\u2019s wording in that the government does assess whether the proper amounts are paid to eligible recipients.Brown also said told us improper payments caused by participants\u2019 failures to report required, complete or correct information, such as household income and composition, don\u2019t necessarily indicate attempts to cheat, though for a May 5, 2005 GAO report, \"we could not determine the percentage of payment errors that involve participants intentionally withholding information.\" Nationally in 2003, the report said, \"about 5 percent of all payment errors were referred for fraud investigation. Data are not available, however, to determine what percentage of these error cases resulted in disqualifying participants because of fraud.\" The report said that almost two-thirds of food stamp payment errors were caused by government caseworkers, usually when they failed to keep up with reported changes or make mistakes applying program rules. Some one-third of payment errors were caused by participants\u2019 failures to report required, complete or correct information, such as household income and composition, the report said."

    "claim": "\"The elimination of income and sales taxes in New York is equal to 9 percent of taxable income, meaning that if you make $100,000 a year you lose $9,000\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The label \"False\" is appropriate for the claim that \"The elimination of income and sales taxes in New York is equal to 9 percent of taxable income, meaning that if you make $100,000 a year you lose $9,000.\" This is because the evidence provided contradicts this claim.\n\nFirstly, the article states that the average state and local tax deduction in New York state is equal to 9 percent of a filer's income, which is where Higgins gets the $9,000 figure from. However, this does not mean that everyone who makes $100,000 a year will lose $9,000. In fact, the article states that people making between $75,000 and $100,000 deduct $9,949 on average in state and local taxes, which is significantly less than $9,000.\n\nSecondly, even if Higgins had said deduction in his statement, he would still be wrong. The article explains that the deduction for property taxes would be capped at $10,000, and if someone's property tax bill is more than that amount, the difference could not be deducted. This means that the actual savings for people making $100,000 a year would be less than $9,000.\n\nFinally, the article provides a caveat that even if Higgins' claim were true, it would only hold up if there isn't a compromise. This suggests that the actual impact of the bill on residents in New York state could be different from the $9,000 figure cited by Higgins.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that \"The elimination of income and sales taxes in New York is equal to 9 percent of taxable income, meaning that if you make $100,000 a year you lose $9,000\" is false.",
    "doc": "Rep. Brian Higgins, D-Buffalo, claimed the House Republican tax reform bill could slash middle-class incomes as much as 9 percent. New York state taxpayers would lose money if Congress decides to end the federal deduction of state and local taxes, he said. \"The elimination of income and sales taxes in New York is equal to 9 percent of taxable income, meaning that if you make $100,000 a year you lose $9,000,\" Higgins said at a hearing. \"If you make $50,000 a year, you lose $4,500.\" About 3.3 million people in New York state take advantage of the state and local tax deduction, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a tax policy and research organization. More than half of those who take the deduction make $100,000 a year or less. Is Higgins right that those taxpayers could lose as much as $9,000? Explaining the SALT deduction The current tax code allows taxpayers to deduct their state and local taxes from their federal taxes. About one-third of filers do this in New York state. That helps residents in states like New York where property taxes are higher. Filers can also deduct either their state income tax or sales tax, but not both. The House Republican tax plan would cap the maximum property tax deduction at $10,000 and end the deduction for state income and sales tax altogether. About two-thirds of filers choose instead to take the standard deduction, a fixed amount set each year. Where\u2019s the number from? What Higgins said is different from what he meant to say, said Theresa Kennedy, the congressman\u2019s spokeswoman. He meant to say filers would no longer be able to deduct $9,000 -- not lose $9,000 outright. Higginssupports that claim with data from the Government Finance Officers Association.The group said the average state and local tax deduction in New York state is equal to 9 percent of a filer's income.That's where Higgins get the $9,000 figure from. Nine percent of $100,000 is $9,000. That\u2019s in the ballpark. People making between $75,000 and $100,000 deduct $9,949 on average in state and local taxes, according to data from the Tax Policy Center. \"How much they'll actually save depends on the tax rate,\" said Frank Sammartino, a senior fellow at the center. Couples making $100,000 are currently taxed at 25 percent. That wouldn\u2019t change under the Republican plan. A $9,000 tax deduction could save that couple $2,250 in tax, according to the IRS. One caveat Even if Higgins had said deduction in his statement, he would still be wrong. Higgins made his claim after House Republicans decided to keep the deduction for property taxes. The deduction would be capped at $10,000. If someone\u2019s property tax bill is more than that amount, the difference could not be deducted. The Senate bill does not include that proposal. Sammartino said Higgins\u2019 claim would hold up if there isn\u2019t a compromise. \"Nine thousand would be true if it was a complete repeal,\" Sammartino said. \"But it would be something less than that\" with the deduction for property taxes. The average property tax deduction is $6,522 for someone making between $75,000 and $100,000 in New York. That falls below the cap. \"People would be protected to some degree,\" Sammartino said. Kennedy, the spokeswoman for Higgins, said the bill still affects residents in his district, regardless of the final numbers. \"We can debate the exact numbers which will be different for each taxpayer, but the bottom line is that hardworking Western New Yorkers have a lot to lose in both the Senate and House legislation which continues to change by the minute,\" Kennedy said."

    "justification": "The claim that \"There's a 1.5 percent to 2 percent overhead in Medicare\" is appropriate because of the evidence provided in the article. According to the article, the trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds reported total Medicare expenditures of $522.8 billion for 2010, with $7 billion listed as \"administrative expenses,\" which works out to 1.3 percent. This is closer to the range of 1.5 percent to 2 percent claimed by Boxer than the 20 percent to 30 percent cited in some opinion and news articles. Additionally, a study by the Congressional Budget Office found that administrative costs for private insurers were around 11 percent to 12 percent, while Medicare's administrative cost total already includes payments to other agencies for such services, making it more cost-efficient. The article also notes that measuring overhead is worthwhile but has its limitations, suggesting that the claimed range of 1.5 percent to 2 percent may be appropriate. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is justified based on the evidence provided in the article.",
    "doc": "Amid a fierce debate over the future of Medicare, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., recently compared the administrative costs for the government-run program with the costs for private insurers.\"There's a 1.5 percent to 2 percent overhead in Medicare,\" Boxer said during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews on May 24, 2011. \"The insurance companies have a 20 percent to 30 percent overhead.\"The issue is timely because Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has proposed reducing the government role in Medicare for people now younger than 55. They would receive financial support to buy coverage on the private market. Supporters say such a plan is needed to keep the program fiscally solvent, while detractors say it would gut longstanding protections and promises to seniors.Boxer\u2019s comment cuts to the core of whether a government-run program like Medicare has advantages over one in which private insurers take a primary role.First, we should define \"overhead.\" People may think of it as things such as rent and electricity. But in health care, the term typically refers more broadly to administrative costs, including expenses that are not strictly medical, such as marketing, customer service, billing, claims review, quality assurance, information technology and profits.To measure the administrative costs for Medicare, we first turned to the 2011 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds -- the document prepared by Medicare\u2019s fiscal overseers.The trustees\u2019 summary listed total Medicare expenditures of $522.8 billion for 2010, of which $7 billion was characterized as \"administrative expenses.\" That works out to 1.3 percent -- not far off from what Boxer stated.For the private insurance market, we turned to a 2008 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. CBO cited data, compiled by the McKinsey Global Institute, that estimated administrative costs for private insurers at 12 percent. That\u2019s quite a bit lower than the 20 percent to 30 percent Boxer cited.A different measurement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pegged the amount for private insurers at 11.1 percent for 2009 -- in the same ballpark.However, the administrative burden for private plans get more complicated the deeper you dig. There are large variations between different types of insurance plans. The data cited by CBO found that administrative costs were about 7 percent for employers with at least 1,000 employees, but 26 percent for firms with 25 or fewer employees. Meanwhile, in the individual insurance market -- that is, plans secured by individuals on their own, rather than through an employer -- the rate was nearly 30 percent, CBO said.A big reason for this variation, CBO and others have concluded, is that bigger plans can spread costs over a larger number of people.When we asked Boxer\u2019s office for their source for the 20 percent-to-30 percent statistic, spokesman Andy Stone told us that prior to passage of the Democratic health care bill in 2010, health plans in California were only required to spend 70 percent of premiums on medical care, with insurers able to spend up to 30 percent on profits and administrative costs. He also cited some opinion and news articles that cited figures in the 20 percent to 30 percent range, and even higher.We don\u2019t doubt that there are cases in which overhead reaches or exceeds 30 percent, but those cases are both anecdotal and at the high end of the range. The averages cited by CBO and CMS are significantly lower -- 11 percent to 12 percent -- and many of the bigger plans undercut even that level.There are a few other factors to consider:Is Medicare\u2019s administrative cost really that low? A lively academic debate has broken out over whether Medicare\u2019s administrative costs are really as low as 1 percent or 2 percent.The difference stems from whether Medicare essentially freeloads off other parts of the federal government for services that private insurers have to pay for on their own. Adjusted estimates for Medicare\u2019s administrative costs cited by the Urban Institute, a think tank that does research on issues such as poverty and economics, range from 3.6 percent to 5 percent, rather than the 1.3 percent using the data in the trustees\u2019 report.But Edwin Park, a health policy specialist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that the differences are overblown, since Medicare\u2019s administrative cost total already includes payments to other agencies for such services.We won\u2019t settle this question, but we will point out evidence that even when you control for the differences, Medicare is still considerably more cost-efficient. In one study, CBO found that privately run Medicare plans had 11 percent overhead, compared to 2 percent for traditional Medicare.Are \"overhead\" costs a useful way to measure the efficiency of a health plan?Not necessarily. As the insurance industry often says -- and independent experts generally agree -- the right kind of administrative expenses may actually lead to cost savings and improved outcomes. These include disease management, wellness programs and quality improvement programs. CBO notes that a heavily managed insurance plan may spend more on overhead but may end up with lower premiums and better outcomes, whereas a lightly managed program may spend less on overhead but end up charging its policyholders more, with less positive results. By this logic, a higher-overhead plan might actually be preferable.In addition, Henry Aaron, a health care specialist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, suggested that over the long run, Medicare could benefit financially from having higher administrative costs in at least one area -- anti-fraud enforcement.In other words, measuring overhead is worthwhile, but it has its limitations."

Therefore, if you count the entire period from November 13 to April 17, when President Obama made his remark, Lynch had waited for 155 days. If you only count the time after the Republicans took over the Senate, the delay was 100 days by the time of Obama's comments and 103 days by the publication date of this article.\n\nWhile it is true that Lynch's nomination has waited longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees, the evidence also shows that the delay for Lynch was unusual compared to historical standards. Only a few nominations in recent decades have waited for longer than 100 days, according to the Senate Historical Office. Moreover, Obama's argument that Presidents are typically given the right to field their own team and Lynch's previous confirmations and stellar credentials make it unclear why her nomination should take so long for a confirmation vote.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it can be justified that Loretta Lynch's nomination has been sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined.",
    "doc": "Democrats have recently been accusing Senate Republicans of obstructing the nomination of Loretta Lynch to succeed Eric Holder as attorney general. Lynch, currently the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, would become the first African-American woman to head the Justice Department, but she\u2019s been awaiting a confirmation vote by the full Senate for several months. While observers expect Lynch to win confirmation, the Senate\u2019s Republican majority has been withholding a vote as leverage to secure other legislative items. In addition, some Republicans have taken issue with Lynch\u2019s refusal to speak out against President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, which some in the GOP have called unconstitutional. Obama himself decried the delay at a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on April 17, 2015. Obama called it a \"crazy situation where a woman who everybody agrees is qualified, who has gone after terrorists, who has worked with police officers to get gangs off the streets, who is trusted by the civil rights community and by police unions as being somebody who is fair and effective and a good manager -- nobody suggests otherwise -- who has been confirmed twice before by the United States Senate for one of the biggest law enforcement jobs in the country, has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined.\" We wondered: Has Lynch\u2019s nomination been \"sitting there longer than the previous seven Attorney General nominees combined\"? We looked at data from the Senate about the past seven nominees. Here\u2019s a rundown, in reverse chronological order: Nominee President Nomination received by Senate Confirmed by Senate Days Eric Holder Obama Jan. 20, 2009 Feb. 2, 2009 13 Michael Mukasey G.W. Bush Sept. 21, 2007 Nov. 8, 2007 17 Alberto Gonzales G.W. Bush Jan. 4, 2005 Feb. 3, 2005 30 John Ashcroft G.W. Bush Jan. 29, 2001 Feb. 1, 2001 3 Janet Reno Clinton Feb. 26, 1993 Mar. 11, 1993 13 William Barr G.H.W. Bush Oct. 25, 1991 Nov. 20, 1991 26 Richard Thornburgh Reagan July 25, 1988 Aug. 11, 1988 17 TOTAL 119 So the previous seven nominees waited a collective 119 days. How about Lynch? Here it gets a little complicated. Lynch\u2019s nomination was initially received in the Senate on Nov. 13, 2014. The Senate -- then under lame-duck Democratic control -- did not move the nomination forward. One obvious problem, beyond a short calendar interrupted by Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks: Rushing the nomination through might have been seen as thwarting the will of the people, who had just voted for a Republican Senate. Then, the Obama administration resubmitted Lynch\u2019s nomination to the newly Republican-held chamber on Jan. 7, 2015. That\u2019s standard procedure when one Congress ends and another begins. If you count the entire period -- from Nov. 13 to April 17, the day of Obama\u2019s remark -- then Lynch had waited for 155 days (and 158 by this article\u2019s publication date). That\u2019s easily more than the 119 logged by the previous seven nominees. However, if you count only the time after the Republicans took over the Senate -- the period for which Obama\u2019s obstructionism argument is strongest -- the delay was 100 days by the time of Obama\u2019s comments, and 103 by this article\u2019s publication. That\u2019s less than the 119 days waited by the previous seven nominees, though it\u2019s possible the wait could ultimately reach or exceed 119 days if no action is taken by early May. Obama does has a point that the delay for Lynch -- however many days it was -- has been unusually long. Of the hundreds and hundreds of nominations submitted in recent decades, only a few have waited for longer than 100 days, according to the Senate Historical Office. Among the more notable waits: \u2022 Richard Cordray, nominated for director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2011-13: 1+ years \u2022 Miguel Estrada, nominated for U.S. Circuit Court judgeship, 2003: 240 days \u2022 Richard Holbrooke, ambassador to the United Nations, 1999: 176 days \u2022 Lewis L. Strauss, nominated for Commerce Secretary, 1959: 152 days \u2022 Robert Gates, nominated for CIA Director, 1991: 134 days \u2022 Robert Bork, nominated for Supreme Court, 1987: 108 days Of these, the only nominee for an official Cabinet position to wait longer than Lynch was Strauss, and that was more than half a century ago. So Lynch\u2019s case is pretty unusual by historical standards. Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a political scientist at George Washington University, sees the argument for starting the clock with the resubmission of Lynch\u2019s nomination, but she added that focusing on that distinction misses the larger point. \"Presidents are typically given the right to field their own team,\" Binder said. \"Given Lynch's previous confirmations and stellar credentials, why force her and the president to wait so long for a confirmation vote?\" Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist who has studied the Senate, agreed. \"There\u2019s a little sleight of hand\" in Obama\u2019s comment, \"but the overall message is that there\u2019s been a lot of delay and that it\u2019s historic in length.\" And it\u2019s not as if Republicans were powerless to resist even if the Democratic-controlled Senate had tried to act, said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist and Senate expert at Washington University in St. Louis. \"The Democrats could have moved the nomination quickly at the end of the last Congress if the Republicans were not requiring cloture on everything, even nominations, which created a backlog of must-pass legislation and nominations as the Congress came to a close,\" Smith said."

    "doc": "Two huge political news stories collided this week on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation \u2014 the release of Hillary Clinton\u2019s new memoir and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s head-scratching Republican primary loss to a poorly funded novice candidate. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus was on set to answer how the GOP, still waging an internal war, would come together to defeat Clinton in 2016, assuming she runs. Priebus, though, said Republicans have a much deeper bench of heavyweights, adding that Clinton\u2019s star is fading. \"We're now running with a lot of great people that have a vision for this country like Bobby Jindal, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rand Paul, and others, in my own state of Wisconsin, that are very dynamic,\" Priebus said. \"And it looks like Hillary Clinton is getting ready. She went from a 70-percent approval rating down to ... 52 in 18 months.\" (Priebus stumbled slightly over the final approval number but corrected himself to say 52.) Has the shine really worn off that much since Clinton left office in January 2013? We asked Priebus to back up his numbers. GOP spokesman Sean Spicer pointed us to new data from a Bloomberg National Poll. In December 2012, Clinton received very high marks from Bloomberg\u2019s respondents. At the time, 70 percent of those surveyed had either a very favorable or mostly favorable view of the Secretary of State. And how did she do in Bloomberg\u2019s recent poll? On June 12, 2014, Clinton had a net favorable rating of just 52 percent, a drop of 18 points. So, Priebus is right, right? Not entirely. The Bloomberg poll released in 2012 is pretty far off the average for polls taken around that time, making it a bit of an outlier. While a couple of other polls in late 2012 and early 2013 put Clinton's favorability at 67 percent, other polls (like CBS) had it around 55 percent. The Huffington Post Pollster, which aggregates and averages most credible polls, put Clinton\u2019s favorability rating at 58.2 percent on Dec. 9, 2012. Where is it at now? It\u2019s at 52.6 percent. That\u2019s definitely lower than where it was just 18 months ago, but it\u2019s not nearly as drastic of a drop as Bloomberg found. It\u2019s also up from where it was in December 2013, when Clintonbottomed out at 49.3 percent favorable, suggesting perhaps that Clinton is on the rebound, instead of a downward spiral. (The high point for Clinton since 2009 was actually January 2011, when about 62 percent viewed her favorably.) Here\u2019s Clinton\u2019s favorability over time. \"If we look at individual polls, then one can find results close to those cited (by Priebus), but only by ignoring other polls,\" said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll. \"The trend, which doesn\u2019t cherry-pick polls but averages across all of them, finds a move from 56.1 (when she left office) to 52.6.\" For PolitiFact, Franklin analyzed polls that have asked Clinton-specific questions at multiple times and found an average decline in those polls of about 8 points in the last 12-20 months. This won\u2019t weigh into our rating, but since Priebus singled out a few names, we thought it would be interesting to compare Clinton\u2019s performance against them in a hypothetical election. We used Pollster\u2019s average (which didn\u2019t have enough data on Clinton vs. Jindal to for us include the Louisiana governor). Opponent January 2013 June 2014 Clinton vs. Jeb Bush 55.7 to 35.8 53.5 to 39.8 Clinton vs. Chris Christie 49.1 to 40.0 51.9 to 39.9 Clinton vs. Rand Paul 52.2 to 41.6* 52.9 to 40.3 Clinton vs. Paul Ryan 55.7 to 37.2 52.0 to 37.9 *Earliest polling data was March 2013 So, while Priebus makes the case that the GOP has a handful of candidates well suited to take on a diminishing Clinton brand, actually, despite a drop in favorability, she continues to do relatively well against the Republicans he mentioned. She would beat all four we looked at if the election were held today, and has only seen her lead shrink slightly against Bush and Ryan. (It\u2019s gone up against Christie and Paul.)"

These figures indicate that the wealthy would benefit more significantly from Trump's tax plan than they did under the Bush tax cuts. Furthermore, eliminating the carried interest tax break could further lower the tax rate for many one percenters, resulting in an even greater increase in their after-tax incomes. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for Hillary Clinton's statement about Donald Trump's tax plan.",
    "doc": "With a backdrop of leaked lewd comments and Bill Clinton\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct, you may not necessarily remember what Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton said about tax policy in the deeply personal and nasty Oct. 9 presidential debate. When Trump touted his proposal to deliver tax cuts for all, Clinton pointed out that his tax plan would help millionaires and billionaires like himself the most. \"His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they\u2019ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two,\" Clinton said. \"Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.\" Is Clinton right that the wealthy would benefit from Trump\u2019s tax plan twice as much as they did under the Bush tax cuts? The Clinton campaign told us their data comes from an analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities on after-tax incomes of the top 1 percent. We also looked at the share of tax relief received by the top 1 percent as a percentage of GDP. The evidence shows Clinton is right. The Bush tax cuts As a refresher, the Bush tax cuts, enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003, reduced the then-top marginal tax rate of 39.6 percent rate to 35 percent, the 36 percent rate to 33 percent, and so forth. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that the Bush cuts increased the after-tax income of the top 1 percent between 5.3 percent and 6.7 percent from 2004 to 2012 (tax rates for high-income earners were raised the following year). Altogether, the top 1 percent received a cut equivalent to about 0.66 percent of GDP (the Bush tax cuts were altogether 2.4 percent of GDP, while the top 1 percent received 27.5 percent of the cuts.) Trump\u2019s plan Trump\u2019s plan would increase after-tax incomes of the wealthy between 10.2 to 19.9 percent, according to the Tax Foundation,and delivera tax cut equivalent to about 1.32 percent of GDP. Two key provisions in Trump\u2019s latest tax plan, released September 2016, are particularly relevant to this fact-check. First, Trump would collapse the current seven tax brackets into four, reducing the current top marginal income tax rate of 39.6 percent to 33 percent. (His previous tax plan called for a top marginal rate of 25 percent.) Second, Trump would also reduce the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. He would also apply this rate to pass-through businesses, so-called because their profits currently \"pass through\" the business and instead are taxed as their owner's ordinary income. These would include partnerships like law firms and investor groups, sole proprietorships, limited liability corporations (LLCs) and corporations with less than 100 shareholders. In its analysis of Trump\u2019s tax plan, the Tax Foundation used both the 33 percent personal tax rate as well as the 15 percent pass-through business rate to assess the plan\u2019s impact on individual taxpayers. The Tax Foundation found that, depending on which rate you apply and whether you factor in growth, the top 1 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax incomes increase by 10.2 to 19.9 percent. Here\u2019s a table breaking down Trump\u2019s proposed tax cuts by income group: Similarly, the Tax Policy Center, which is affiliated with the Urban Institute, estimated that the top 1 percent would see a 13.5 percent gain in after-tax income. The think tank also said the Trump\u2019s cuts would amount to about 2.6 percent of GDP, with 50.8 percent of the cuts going to the top 1 percent. In other words, the top 1 percent would see a tax break equivalent to about 1.32 percent of GDP. Clinton may actually be understating the gains the top 1 percent would receive under Trump. The Tax Foundation does not take into account one additional proposal that could affect the bottom line of many one percenters: eliminating the carried interest tax break. Currently, profits from investment funds can be taxed at a personal capital gains tax rate of 23.9 percent rather than the top marginal income rate of 39.6 percent. Taxing these lucrative earnings as ordinary income would raise about $18 billion over 10 years. While Trump\u2019s plan calls for closing this loophole, it could also lower the tax rate since he\u2019s proposing to tax pass-through businesses at a corporate tax rate of 15 percent \u2014 an 8.9 percentage point reduction from the current rate applied to hedge fund and private equity profits, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted."

    "doc": "Democrat Pete Gallego, who lost his U.S. House seat to Republican Will Hurd in 2014, seeks a 2016 rematch. A reason for voters to change sides, Gallego said in an April 2, 2015, email blast, is that Hurd evidently doesn\u2019t have time to fulfill his duties. \"Just two weeks ago, Congressman Hurd quit his post on the House Committee on Small Business saying that he was unable to find the time to serve,\" Gallego said. We were curious about Gallego\u2019s charge. Is freshman Hurd short of time? Resignation letter Gallego\u2019s campaign spokesman, Anthony Gutierrez, responded to us by email by pointing out a March 2015 entry in the Congressional Record showing that Hurd, a former CIA officer, asked to be removed from the committee in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner. Hurd\u2019s letter, dated March 16, 2015, said: \"I write today to resign from the House Small Business Committee. While I appreciate the honor of being appointed, in order to best serve the constituent of Texas' 23rd Congressional District, I believe I must focus on my existing committee assignments. \"With my background in the intelligence community cybersecurity, and representing the district with the largest length of U.S.-Mexico Border, my ability to focus on my Information Technology Subcommittee Chairmanship and Border and Maritime Subcommittee Vice-Chairmanship is where I believe I can be of most value to my constituents and colleagues in the House. \"I appreciate your timely consideration of this request.\" According to the CR entry, the Texan\u2019s resignation was accepted the same day. Hurd's committee assignments We looked next into Hurd's workload. His House website says Hurd serves on the House Homeland Security Committee; he\u2019s vice chair of its Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee and also serves on its Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee. Hurd also serves on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for which he chairs its Information Technology subcommittee; his appointment to the chairmanship was described as a plum prize in a February 2015 San Antonio Express-News news story pointed out to us by Shana Teehan, Hurd\u2019s communications director. Hurd also serves on the oversight panel\u2019s National Security Subcommittee. An online search led us to a web page created by the House clerk, dated Feb. 10, 2015, listing each member\u2019s committee assignments. That list showed Hurd as a member of the small business panel plus the two others. Counting Hurd, six Texas members of the House were assigned to three committees each; the other 30 Texans had one or two assignments. And as of April 7, 2015, Hurd was still listed as a member of all three panels on another House clerk\u2019s web page. (Previously, Gallego was a member of two committees.) Hurd campaign elaborates By phone, Hurd campaign spokesman Josh Robinson said Hurd initially learned of his appointment to the small business panel from a committee-issued press release. The panel\u2019s Jan. 21, 2015, announcement listed Hurd among 14 committee members. According to the committee's calendar, the panel subsequently met three times before Hurd resigned. Hurd appreciated the appointment, Robinson told us, but given his other assignments and desire to travel back and forth to the vast 23rd Congressional District, he decided \"being in another committee meeting in D.C. was not going to be helpful.\" Hurd, Robinson said, would rather focus on small businesses in his district than \"listen to a bunch of bureaucrats\" in hearings. Chairman Chabot: 'Procedural glitch' By email, Teehan provided a statement she described as obtained by Hurd\u2019s office about March 18, 2015, from Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, who chairs the small business panel. Chabot, praising Hurd\u2019s energy and enthusiasm, is quoted saying that even though \"a procedural glitch means it is necessary to change his committee assignments, I know he\u2019ll be a dedicated voice for working Americans across his district.\" Teehan also emailed Rep. Lamar Smith\u2019s description of Hurd\u2019s appointment to the small business panel as \"a small administrative matter that has now been corrected.\" Smith, R-San Antonio, serves on the House Republican Steering Committee, which Teehan described as responsible for Republican committee assignments. Glitch? Administrative error? We left messages for aides to Chabot and Smith seeking elaboration while wondering how this might pertain to Hurd\u2019s departure from the committee. We didn\u2019t hear back. Next, we filled in Gallego\u2019s adviser, Gutierrez, who pointed out by email that House committee assignments, including Hurd\u2019s appointment to the small business committee, were entered into the Congressional Record on Jan. 13, 2015--eight days before the mentioned press release came out and about two months before Hurd submitted his letter to leave the committee."

However, this growth is not entirely due to the tax cut, as the state's count for insurance jobs relied on two different starting places to calculate job growth, leading to an apples-to-apples comparison that shows the state actually lost insurance industry jobs between 2007 and 2010. Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that the industry gained only 100 jobs from December 2007 to December 2010, not 40,000 as claimed. Therefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate.",
    "doc": "Good news, opponents of job growth (whoever you are): Tallahassee lawmakers are out to make it harder and costlier to create jobs. That\u2019s the thrust of a TV ad airing in Tampa Bay from the business-backed lobbying group Associated Industries of Florida. The group does not want the insurance industry to lose a tax break it has enjoyed for more than three decades. Here\u2019s the transcript: \"It's the working tax cut that creates jobs -- over 40,000 new jobs in just the last four years. Major employers are moving to Florida and hiring. That's growth our economy needs. But now some in Tallahassee want to end it and make it harder and more expensive to create jobs. It doesn't make sense. Say no to Senate Bill 1832. Keep the working tax cut. Keep the jobs.\" The ad ignores the real keywords of this debate, which are \"insurance companies\" and \"motor vehicle registration fees.\" \"Working tax cut\" is a euphemism for \"taxpayer-subsidized premium tax credit.\" Since 1987, insurance companies use a 15 percent premium tax credit for Florida-based employees, excluding insurance agents. The Senate\u2019s chief budget-writer, Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, proposed eliminating the tax credit in exchange for rolling back the Legislature\u2019s 2009 hike on motor vehicle registration fees, a move that will save vehicle owners $12 a year. We wondered what evidence AIF had to support its claim that this 26-year-old tax cut created 40,000 jobs in the last four years. Debunking the jobs number AIF\u2019s public relations consultant, Bascom Communications and Consulting, directed us to 2009 and 2011 reports about the state\u2019s insurance industry by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (the 2012 report is not out yet). The reports run a year or two behind for job estimates for the industry. The 2011 annual report references 2010 jobs data, and the 2009 report includes 2007 jobs data. According to state reports, the insurance industry accounted for 144,184 jobs in Florida in 2007 and grew to 188,290 in 2010. Boom, AIF says, 44,106 new insurance jobs created. Not so fast. This picture of dramatic jobs growth is not supported by evidence. The state reports cited by AIF say their jobs data is backed up by two sources: the Bureau of Economic Analysis, run by the U.S. Department of Commerce; and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, run by the U.S. Department of Labor. State insurance regulators were still collecting information about how it compiles its data by our deadline. It appears, though, that the dramatic jobs growth AIF is crowing about is the result of the state using two very different starting places to calculate job growth. Here's what most likely happened: The state's count for insurance jobs in 2007 (the 144,184 number) is backed by BEA jobs data for full- and part-time wage and salary employees, excluding proprietors and general partners. But the 2010 state number relied on a different calculation, one that includes proprietors and general partners. It's a significant difference. An apples-to-apples comparison of job growth -- whether or not you include proprietors and general partners -- shows that the state actually lost insurance industry jobs between 2007 and 2010. We'll say that again. If the state compared the same set of data -- either one -- they would have found that the state lost insurance industry jobs between 2007 and 2010. BLS data does not help, either. From December 2007 to December 2010, the industry gained 100 jobs, according to BLS. Not 40,000. Does the credit lead to jobs? Tax credits save businesses money. But is this one entirely responsible for an uptick in insurance jobs? \"Extremely unlikely,\" said William Seyfried, Rollins College economics professor. \"General economic conditions and other factors would be expected to have a larger impact.\" Florida should enact a premium tax break for every industry \"and just watch the jobs pour in,\" joked Sean Snaith, a University of Central Florida economist. The business-backed research and advocacy group Florida TaxWatch created a brief report detailing its concerns with ending the tax credit, which the group said was created to encourage \"mobile jobs\" that are administrative or in call centers (our analysis does not get into whether the credit created the kind of jobs it was supposed to, though lobbyists ticked off a few recent examples of call centers opening in Tampa and other Florida cities recently). TaxWatch argued this tax cut, while not the primary reason companies come to Florida, may be the tie-breaker, and it offsets the insurance industry\u2019s disproportionate tax burden compared to other industries. \"While there has been no research attempting to show a direct correlation between the tax credit and growth of the insurance industry in Florida,\" the report states, \"it is hard to argue that Florida\u2019s business climate is more attractive to insurers with the credit than without it.\" AIF's own lobbyist, Brewster Bevis, said at an April 18 committee hearing on SB 1832, \"One of the reasons for the job creation and industry growth in the face of national economic uncertainty has been the attractiveness of Florida as a place to do business due to the premium tax cut that this bill would do away with.\" Several insurance lobbyists at the meeting testified SB 1832 would increase the industry\u2019s tax burden on top of what carriers will pay in additional taxes under the new national health care law. Several Republican senators were skeptical, saying the Legislature had historically worked to improve the business climate for the insurance industry and too many years had passed since the tax incentive was reviewed. Repealing the insurance tax credit would bring about $230 million to state coffers each year, which would pay for reducing motor vehicle fees, according to a committee analysis. \"Not only will this bill rid our state of an antiquated government subsidy for the insurance industry, but, more importantly, it will keep money in the pockets of our hard-working taxpayers,\" said Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, in a statement."

    "doc": "Many readers have asked us to review a recent claim reverberating around the Internet that stems from an article posted on an anti-abortion website, lifenews.com. The March 12, 2012, article is titled, \"Obama Admin Finalizes Rules: $1 Abortions in ObamaCare.\" Referring to a rule recently issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, lifenews.com published the following: \"It\u2019s official. The concern pro-life organizations had about the ObamaCare legislation funding abortions has been confirmed, as the Obama administration has issued the final rules on abortion funding governing the controversial health care law. Nestled within the \u2018individual mandate\u2019 in the Obamacare act \u2014 that portion of the Act requiring every American to purchase government-approved insurance or pay a penalty \u2014 is an \u2018abortion premium mandate.\u2019 This mandate requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion. As a result, many pro-life Americans will have to decide between a plan that violates their consciences by funding abortion, or a plan that may not meet their health needs.\" We\u2019ll look at whether the Obama administration has issued rules for \"$1 abortions in ObamaCare\" and required \"all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion.\" (We emailed lifenews.com but did not hear back.) As we\u2019ve noted before, abortion has been a thorny issue in the process of drafting and enacting a health care law from the beginning. Since 1976, the federal government has been guided by the Hyde Amendment, a law that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in peril. Due to that amendment -- which must be renewed every year -- abortion services are not provided in health care plans offered to federal employees and for active and retired military. But the health care reform bill set up health care \"exchanges\" in which private insurance companies can compete for the business of buyers who do not get their insurance through an employer. The question became: Should private companies be allowed to offer abortion coverage (as most already do) when operating through the exchanges? And what if the people buying policies are getting government subsidies to buy insurance? The final rules from HHS don\u2019t dramatically alter the approach taken by the law itself. For starters, when the exchanges begin operating in 2014, some states will ban all abortion coverage entirely for any plan selling on that state\u2019s exchange. Doing so is allowed by a state \"opt-out\" clause that was passed as part of the health care law. According to the National Right to Life Committee, 15 states have passed such laws so far, with other legislatures considering similar measures. Beyond that, every state must offer at least one plan on its exchange that doesn\u2019t cover abortion, and that plan will include the same minimum benefit package for non-abortion services that is required of every other plan sold on the exchanges. In addition, no private insurer will be forced to cover abortion; doing so will be their choice, at least in states that choose to allow it. However, unless and until opt-out laws are passed by the other 35 states, insurers will be allowed to sell policies on the exchanges that include abortion coverage. To allow this yet still abide by the Hyde Amendment, sponsors of the bill drafted a special procedure to differentiate between dollars spent on abortion coverage and dollars spent for everything else. (Anti-abortion advocates have consistently argued that the approach doesn\u2019t offer strong enough protections to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion. More on that later.) Any insurer offering a plan on the exchange that includes abortion coverage must set up two separate accounts for dollars received and paid. One account would hold money that is used to pay for abortion services (except for abortions that are the result of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother, which may be paid for under the Hyde Amendment). The other account would hold money that is used to pay for everything else. All federal dollars, such as federal subsidies received by purchasers on the exchange whose incomes are low enough to qualify for them, would be deposited in the non-abortion account. Most of the premiums paid by the plan\u2019s beneficiaries would also go into this account, but a fraction of individual premium payments would be sent to the abortion account, so that enough money is available to pay for claims submitted by beneficiaries for abortion services. The Obama administration has issued rules for \"$1 abortions in ObamaCare\" So where does that $1figure come from? HHS has determined the minimum amount that insurers offering plans that include abortion must allocate per beneficiary into this abortion account. An insurer \"may not estimate such a cost at less than $1 per enrollee, per month,\" HHS said. That\u2019s where it comes from. But what does it mean? It means that a plan cannot contribute less than $1of premiums per month per beneficiary into the abortion fund. That\u2019s all. It doesn\u2019t mean that abortions will cost one dollar -- which seems an obvious interpretation of the phrase \"$1 abortions in ObamaCare.\" Rather, it\u2019s a way of filling the account so that there\u2019s enough money to pay abortion providers for their services. The actual amount per enrollee per month may be a lot higher, depending on what the insurer\u2019s actuaries determine. So the claim of \"$1 abortions\" is ridiculously inaccurate. What about the second claim? The law \"requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion.\" This claim echoes many made by anti-abortion advocates since the law was first proposed. Critics argue that the health care law\u2019s protections against taxpayer dollars being used to fund abortions are inadequate. \"The most objectionable aspect is that it is a smokescreen intended to conceal the new and massive federal subsidies (\u2018tax credits\u2019) to health plans that cover abortion on demand -- a sharp break from decades of federal policy,\" said Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee. \"Under Medicaid and the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, for example, federal funds do not go to plans that cover elective abortions.\" But let\u2019s parse the lifenews.com statement closely. For starters, it refers to \"all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion services\" -- but the issue at hand actually affects only persons who purchased insurance from the exchanges. According to the Congressional Budget Office, by 2018, there will be 24 million people buying insurance through the exchanges, compared to 184 million people with either employer-provided insurance or individually purchased insurance outside the exchanges. So the maximum number of people theoretically affected by this concern is 12 percent of private-insurance beneficiaries in 2018. And that number could decline substantially once you subtract residents of the 15 states (or more) that bar any abortion coverage in exchange-sold policies, and after you subtract those individuals that purchase one of the non-abortion options required to be offered by the exchanges. This group falls well short of \"all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion.\" But even this is a side issue. We have ruled in the past that the health care law does not provide federal funding for abortion. Our conclusion was that even if you have the opportunity to buy abortion coverage on the exchanges -- and Americans in many states won\u2019t have that option -- you won\u2019t be forced to buy such coverage. Non-abortion options will always be available on the exchanges, and tax dollars sent to those plans through federal subsidies will be placed in accounts walled off from accounts used to pay for abortion services. This all means that anyone purchasing a plan with abortion coverage will be be doing so by choice and paying for it personally. On March 16, 2012, Johnson, of the National Right to Life Committee, and his colleague, senior legislative counsel Susan T. Muskett, raised an issue about the way the law is worded. They wrote that \"if a health plan covers abortion, the rule forbids the plan from calling attention to that fact in any of its advertising or explanatory materials. The disclosure of abortion coverage can be provided \u2018only as part of the summary of benefits and coverage explanation, at the time of enrollment.\u2019 This provision seems designed for no other purpose than to ensure that many people who would not deliberately sign up for abortion-covering plans will do so inadvertently.\" The text of the law does include this line: \"A qualified health plan that provides for coverage of (elective abortion) shall provide a notice to enrollees, only as part of the summary of benefits and coverage explanation, at the time of enrollment, of such coverage.\" This use of the word \"only\" does seem to raise the risk that a plan\u2019s abortion provisions won\u2019t be fully transparent to the buyer. But we think the law does ensure disclosure for any potential purchaser who is paying attention. HHS describes the disclosure summary in question as something akin to the nutritional labels on food -- a standardized form that will allow consumers to easily compare one plan\u2019s features to another\u2019s before they buy. \"Before choosing a health plan, consumers will know whether the plan covers these services,\" said HHS spokeswoman Erin Shields."

Therefore, I would label this claim as \"True\".",
    "doc": "In a recent post on Medium, Robby Mook -- Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager -- countered accusations from Bernie Sanders that Clinton has been tainted by taking money from oil and gas interests. \"In last week\u2019s debate,\" Mook wrote of the April 14 Democratic presidential face-off in Brooklyn, \"Bernie questioned Hillary\u2019s commitment to fighting climate change because a whopping 0.2 percent of the money given to our campaign has come from employees of oil and gas companies. Not even 2 percent, mind you: 0.2 percent.\" We have taken a look at this general topic before but haven\u2019t rated this particular assertion, so we\u2019ll do it here. A look at the numbers We turned to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent clearinghouse for campaign finance data. Clinton has raised $307,561 from people employed by the oil and gas industry. It\u2019s worth noting that not all this money comes from people with deep pockets; this total includes donations from everyone employed by the industry, from CEOs to gas-station employees. Altogether, Clinton\u2019s campaign has raised more than $180 million, so the percentage raised from employees of the oil and gas industry works out to 0.17 percent -- which is actually a bit less than Mook said. By comparison, Sanders has raised less from oil and gas employees than Clinton has -- $53,760 -- which amounts to 0.03 percent of the $182 million his campaign has raised. In any case, this particular statistic looks solid on the math. That said, we\u2019ll raise a caveat. Mook\u2019s narrow focus Mook has worded the claim carefully to exclude other donations, which amounts to a bit of cherry-picking. Mook refers to \"employees.\" But as the Sanders campaign has argued -- citing analyses by Greenpeace and the Huffington Post -- Clinton\u2019s campaign has also received donations from lobbyists who have ties to oil and gas interests. These donations would not be reported as having come from employees of oil and gas companies and thus aren\u2019t included in the total we calculated above. The Huffington Post article, from July 17, 2015, found that \"nearly all of the lobbyists bundling contributions for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign have at one time or another worked for the fossil fuel industry.\" It links to 40 registered lobbyists but only offers details on some donors who still work for the industry. The Greenpeace report says that when you add in donations by lobbyists with an alleged tie to the fossil fuel industry, Clinton's total would rise to nearly $1.8 million. The fossil fuel industry's share of the Clinton coffers would go up to about 0.8 percent. The Sanders campaign added that the Greenpeace report goes a step further to include more than $4 million to Priorities Action USA, the super PAC that supports Clinton. And the Sanders team said that Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil have donated at least $2.5 million to the Clinton Foundation. \"I understand the Clinton campaign objects to these figures, because some of the fossil fuel lobbyists who have bundled huge sums of money for their campaign also represent clients in other industries,\" said Sanders spokesman Warren Gunnels. \"In our view, that makes these contributions even more objectionable. It's the lobbyists in Washington who write the bills and curry special favors for the firms they represent. You can't reform big oil and gas companies by taking bundled campaign cash from their lobbyists.\" The Sanders critique is not a slam-dunk, however For starters, it\u2019s a stretch to draw a direct line between those super PAC donations and Clinton\u2019s campaign. Under federal law, the candidates have no control over super PAC spending. In addition, it\u2019s up for debate how significant these lobbyists\u2019 donations are. It\u2019s not clear how much ofinfluence the oil and gas industry would wield through a donor who once lobbied for them but doesn\u2019t any more. In some cases, the lobbyists advocated for clients in multiple industries, not just oil and gas. Finally, Clinton\u2019s stances on oil and gas issues is not exactly in tune with the industry. She has said that if individuals from the industry want to donate to her, they should know that they may be wasting their money. She favors policies the oil and gas industry doesn\u2019t like, and she is a big supporter of renewable energy, a philosophy Sanders has also embraced."

Michele Bachmann made her case on Fox News for a Mitt Romney presidency.She also got in her digs at the other guy.Under President Barack Obama, she said, you should expect unemployment to rise.\"A report just came out that if we continue with President Obama's policies, we're looking at over 9 percent unemployment next year in the fourth quarter,\" Bachmann told host Sean Hannity in the Aug. 27, 2012, interview in Tampa.The unemployment rate was 8.3 percent in July, so that would mark a serious reversal.We decided to track down the report. The fiscal cliffThe former presidential candidate from Minnesota said she was referring to a report from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency with expert staff that generates projections about how laws affect the federal budget and economy. We reached out to her office for more detail, but didn\u2019t hear back.So we checked out CBO's most recent such report, an update to the country\u2019s economic outlook for the decade. It did include a projection that unemployment could reach 9.1 percent in the fourth quarter next year (Table 2-1).But that projection was not based on continuing \"President Obama\u2019s policies.\" Rather, it was CBO\u2019s look at what would happen if current laws are left unchanged -- which is not what Obama advocates.\"The policies that Rep. Bachmann refers to as 'President Obama\u2019s policies' are in fact what would result if the Congress fails to reach an agreement with the president on how to continue economic stimulus policies which he strongly favors,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. (As we've noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama\u2019s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)If the president and Congress can\u2019t resolve their standoff, what results is referred to alternately as the \"fiscal cliff\" or \"taxmageddon.\" Congress set some of the conditions for the cliff last year in their deal to increase the debt ceiling \u2014 the Budget Control Act. It specified that if Congress couldn\u2019t find $1.2 trillion in budget cuts, automatic cuts would hit across the board, including defense programs. (Bachmann voted against the act; she opposed raising the debt ceiling and called the deal a \"temporary fix.\")So right now, current law would, for instance, impose those stiff automatic spending cuts and let major tax cuts expire. (Obama would renew the tax cuts for those earning under $250,000 and doesn\u2019t want to see automatic cuts.) The deficit would shrink an estimated $641 billion in the next fiscal year. That would most likely lead to a recession, driving down GDP and pushing up unemployment, the CBO calculated.That\u2019s right: Bachmann\u2019s talking about what would happen if the deficit shrinks.It\u2019s worth noting Obama plays a role in the standoff, even if he doesn\u2019t endorse its result.\"He could be blamed, of course, for refusing to negotiate unless Republicans raise taxes, thereby making the cliff more likely,\" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"I suppose the flip side applies as well, though.\"If lawmakers and the president work out a deal that keeps the tax cuts and avoids automatic spending cuts, among other things, CBO calculates that the unemployment rate will drop to 8 percent (Table 2-2) \u2014 not rise.Neither of those scenarios perfectly reflects Obama\u2019s policy goals. But the second one, with its unemployment rate drop, is closest."

This indicates that the roses from previous first ladies were largely gone by the time the Trumps moved in.

    "doc": "First lady Melania Trump is expected to deliver her Republican National Convention speech from the White House Rose Garden on Aug. 25, just days after the renovations she directed in the historic garden were revealed. Not everyone was thrilled with the results of the month-long project. \"Melania dug up the WH Rose Garden, removing roses from every First Lady since 1913,\" one Facebook post said. \"She is as clueless and classless as her husband.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to the White House about the post and did not receive a reply. But a landscape historian we consulted about its claim laughed and said, \"People say the most outrageous things.\" Here\u2019s what we know about the Rose Garden. First lady Ellen Wilson planted a rose garden in 1913, but its official name at the time is unclear, according to the White House Rose Garden Landscape Report published this year by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House. In the second half of the century, \"Rose Garden\" started to appear more frequently, but it was used interchangeably with \"West Garden.\" The Rose Garden that Americans are familiar with today reflects the 1962 design of Rachel Lambert Mellon, who was approached by President John F. Kennedy to help renew the space after he was inspired by the gardens he saw at official residences on a state visit to Europe. \"The garden had a simple plan,\" Mellon wrote in a 1983 essay posted on the White House Historical Association\u2019s website. Saucer magnolia trees were planted in the garden\u2019s four corners. A 50-by-100-foot lawn that could accommodate 1,000 people for ceremonies and receptions would be the garden\u2019s center. Flanking the lawn: smaller trees, roses and other flowers. \"The one flower that unites all occupants through the history of the White House is the rose,\" the essay says. \"Thus, for most of the 20th century, the Rose Garden has been a rose garden. Now, in 1961, President Kennedy wanted it restored in spirit but revised to become more than just a private garden.\" The Trump administration\u2019s overhaul was done in the spirit of the garden\u2019s 1962 design, according to USA Today. The flowers in the garden are mostly pastels and include taller white roses in honor of the first papal visit to the White House in 1979. Boxwoods were added, crabapple trees were removed to be replanted elsewhere, and a limestone walking path now borders the central lawn. Speaking at the official reopening of the Rose Garden on Aug. 22, Melania Trump said improvements to the garden\u2019s infrastructure and utilities would make it fully accessible to Americans with disabilities. She also said that changes to the garden resulted from \"a thoughtful and collaborative process carefully crafted with the help of scholars and experts in architecture, horticulture, design, and historic preservation.\" Drawing from sources like newspaper articles and contemporaneous accounts, the Rose Garden Landscape Report lists 58 different roses that have been grown at the White House over the years, from the Cleveland administration to the Obama administration. The first documented, large scale plan of roses planted in the garden dates back to the Truman administration in 1952. There isn\u2019t even a definitive rose planting plan for the Kennedy Rose Garden, according to the report, and \"records are scarce\" for plantings in the years after until the Carter administration. That was when the National Park Service started producing reports listing changes to the White House Grounds and Gardens, including the roses grown and their location in the garden. \"These reports, along with the scattered knowledge of roses grown previously at the White House, offer a glimpse into changing fashions and tastes in American gardens for roses,\" the Rose Garden Landscape Report says. As the Washington Post reported in July, Melania Trump\u2019s plans for the Rose Garden included the removal and replacement of most of the existing plants and lawn. But Adrian Higgins, the Post\u2019s gardening columnist, writes that \"the renovation is long overdue.\" \"Among the problems to be addressed,\" he wrote, \"a poorly drained lawn that had to be replaced annually, constant disturbance of roots of trees and shrubs by the seasonal planting of annuals, the die-off of rose bushes to the point where only a dozen or so remained.\" Roses are \"fussy,\" said Marta McDowell, a landscape historian who wrote \"All the Presidents\u2019 Gardens,\" a 2016 book about White House gardens. \"They don\u2019t last forever \u2014 plants are living things \u2014 and so sometimes they do need to be replaced.\" When Kennedy and Mellon redesigned the garden in 1962, for example, the roses from previous first ladies were largely gone because they died off or had been replaced, McDowell told us. \"Most of these were long gone by the time the Trumps moved in,\" McDowell said."

    "justification": "The claim that the Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015 would not \"pause\" the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the United States is accurate. The bill does not bar Syrian refugees from entering the country or impose a religious test, but rather adds layers of certification beyond what's already required to ensure that refugees are safe before entering the United States. According to the evidence provided, the bill requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to conduct its own background checks in addition to the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS), and any refugee would be prohibited from entry until the FBI certifies that they pose no security threat. However, the bill does not institute any penalties or consequences for failure to comply with its requirements, and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI Director James Comey made similar arguments during a news conference after the bill passed, suggesting that the bill would create significant delays and obstacles in the fulfillment of a vital program that satisfies both humanitarian and national security objectives.\n\nHowever, House Democrats who broke ranks with their party to support the bill disagreed with both the president and Republicans, citing that the bill \"doesn't hurt the refugee process\" and that the defectors had \"a sense that the underlying reforms weren't severe.\" Based on this evidence, it appears that the Democrats interpreted the bill as requiring additional certifications but not a complete pause in the resettlement of Syrian refugees.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015 adds additional layers of certification for Syrian refugees, it does not bar them from entering the country or impose a religious test, and therefore cannot be said to \"pause\" their resettlement. The interpretation of the bill's impact on the refugee program is mixed, with some interpreting it as causing significant delays and others seeing it as a relatively minor addition to the existing vetting process.",
    "doc": "U.S. Rep Annie Kuster raised eyebrows earlier this month when she claimed on NHPR\u2019s Morning Edition that a bill putting extra restrictions on Syrian refugees wouldn't actually slow down the program. \"The bill would not prohibit Syrian refugees from entering the nation. I think there's been a lot of misinformation frankly about the bill,\" she said. \"It doesn't pause the program. It doesn't apply a religious test. It's a certification that the person does not pose a threat to the security of the United States.\" The bit that caught our attention was Kuster\u2019s statement that the the bill \"doesn\u2019t pause the program.\" Could that be true? Or did the Democrat go overboard in defending her support of a GOP-backed proposal? We decided to check it out. The bill in question is called the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015. Itpassed the U.S. House with nearly unanimous Republican support and with the backing of 47 Democrats, including Kuster. According to behind-the-scenes reporting from the Huffington Post, the White House lobbied Democrats to oppose the measure, but ultimately couldn't persuade them all to oppose the bill. So, what's in the SAFE Act? What does it do, and would it actually slow down Syrian refugees coming into the country? It's useful in this case to go to the bill itself. And luckily for us, the SAFE Act is a relatively simple read. Unfortunately, its implications are murkier. Here are the two most pertinent sections of the bill. They\u2019re worth quoting in full, as we\u2019ll see soon enough. \"In addition to the screening conducted by the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall take all actions necessary to ensure that each covered alien receives a thorough background investigation prior to admission as a refugee. A covered alien may not be admitted as a refugee until the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation certifies to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence that each covered alien has received a background investigation that is sufficient to determine whether the covered alien is a threat to the security of the United States. ... \"A covered alien may only be admitted to the United States after the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the unanimous concurrence of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence, certifies to the appropriate Congressional Committees that the covered alien is not a threat to the security of the United States.\" The rest of the bill adds reporting requirements and defines the refugees in question as those coming from Iraq or Syria. It does not institute any penalties or consequences for failure to comply with its requirements. A simple distillation of that text comes from the govtrack.us website, which describes it thusly: \"H.R. 4038 would expand the screening process for those refugees attempting to enter the United States by requiring the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to conduct its own background checks in addition to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS). Any refugee would be prohibited from entry until the FBI certifies that they pose no security threat. Refugees would only be admitted with the unanimous agreement of the FBI, DHS, and Director of National Intelligence.\" In other words, it adds layers of certification beyond what\u2019s already on the books requiring that refugees are safe before entering the United states. But as Kuster said, the bill does not bar Syrian refugees from the United States, nor does it impose a religious test. What would the legislation mean in practice? The White House certainly had its interpretation, which was the extra requirements would cause big delays. According to an official statement from the executive branch, the bill would \"create significant delays and obstacles in the fulfillment of a vital program that satisfies both humanitarian and national security objectives.\" U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI Director James Comey made the same arguments during a news conference after the bill passed. \"To ask that we have my FBI director make personal guarantees would effectively grind the program to a halt,\" Lynch told reporters last month. And that seemed to be the goal of House Republicans who supported it, at least in part. According to National Public Radio\u2019s reporting, \"Supporters of the bill say it would require a \u2018pause\u2019 in admitting Syrian and Iraqi refugees, as current applications would be halted while a new vetting process was established.\" But the House Democrats who broke ranks with their party to support the bill disagreed with both the president and Republicans. According to the Huffington Post report mentioned earlier, a Democrat told lawmakers that the bill \"doesn't hurt the refugee process, so put a certification stamp at the bottom and move on.\" A top House Democrat cited in the article also said that the defectors had \"a sense that the underlying reforms weren't severe.\" In other words, Kuster and 46 other House Democrats decided that if all that was needed was extra certifications, surely they could be put into place without many problems. And while the bill seems to suggest that the FBI would need to conduct an extra background check -- and the bill summary says as much -- the actual text is less clear about what that would entail. It instead reads that \"the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall take all actions necessary to ensure that each covered alien receives a thorough background investigation.\" That\u2019s not specifically calling for another check. We contacted Kuster\u2019s office, which said the congresswoman\u2019s intention was to protect the American people."

    "doc": "Mitt Romney may have hit a rough patch on the campaign trail, but Gov. Chris Christie recently suggested a winning debate performance this week could propel the Republican presidential candidate to victory in November. Just like the 1980 debate took Ronald Reagan from trailing in the polls to winning 40 states on Election Day, the governor said. The New Jersey governor offered that history lesson last week as Romney and President Barack Obama gear up for their first debate Wednesday. Obama has been leading Romney in most national polls. \"Ask Ronald Reagan if he were around, you know, who was behind in the polls in 1980 going into the debate with Jimmy Carter and then turned around 10 days later and won 40 states,\" Christie, a Republican, said at a Sept. 24 news conference. \"These debates matter. They\u2019re very important.\"It\u2019s true that Reagan won 44 states in the 1980 election, but it\u2019s not entirely accurate for Christie to say Reagan \"was behind in the polls\" going into the debate with Carter.Leading up to that Oct. 28, 1980 debate -- a week before Election Day -- some polls showed Carter with a slight advantage over Reagan, but other polls had Reagan ahead of the president. Still, given the margins of error attached to the polls, the race appeared too close to call, according to various news articles.The governor\u2019s office did not respond to two e-mails seeking comment.Let\u2019s review some of those poll results.In a Gallup poll released the day before the debate, Carter was leading Reagan by three percentage points, 45 percent to 42 percent. That poll was based on a sample of 1,100 registered voters, including 800 likely voters.Another poll done for ABC News and released around the same time offered the exact opposite results: Reagan stood at 45 percent and Carter at 42 percent among likely voters.But news articles said that because of the margins of error for those two polls, the \"race is essentially even\" and a \"virtual dead heat.\"An Associated Press-NBC News poll around the same time showed Reagan with a greater lead over Carter. Among likely voters, 42 percent supported Reagan and 36 percent backed Carter. That poll still had a margin of error of three percent.\"Generally, comparable results from all these polls fall within the error margins of such surveys, meaning the race is really too close to call,\" the Associated Press wrote.The week before the debate, a CBS News/New York Times poll showed Carter leading Reagan, 43 percent to 41 percent among undecided voters. But given that poll\u2019s sampling error, \"Mr. Carter\u2019s lead thus was highly uncertain, and it is quite possible that Mr. Reagan may actually be somewhat ahead,\" according to a New York Times article.Still, Reagan\u2019s debate performance has been considered a deciding factor in his ultimate victory.\"It is my contention that there was significant change in presidential preference by the public starting with the Carter/Reagan debate that accelerated through election day,\" Warren J. Mitofsky, a pollster for CBS News, later wrote.However, leading up to Election Day, polls failed to capture the scope of Reagan's landslide win. As Mitofsky noted, all of the major published polls \"seriously understated\" Reagan\u2019s margin of victory over Carter.In terms of the popular vote, Reagan received about 51.6 percent, beating Carter\u2019s roughly 41.7 percent. The 1980 presidential race also included Independent candidate John B. Anderson, who received about 6.7 percent of the popular vote."

The evidence provided by Morten Jerven, an economist, suggests that there are issues with the data points for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, making it difficult to make conclusions about trends in poverty. Specifically, the article states that \"only 27 of the region\u2019s 48 countries had conducted at least two comparable surveys since 1990 to track poverty,\" and that \"in some countries, such as Liberia and Sudan, there's just one survey.\" This indicates that a significant portion of countries in the region lack sufficient data to make conclusions about trends in poverty. Additionally, the article notes that even when data is available, it can be inconsistent and prone to errors, making it difficult to accurately measure poverty levels. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that for 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is no reliable data available to make claims about trends in poverty.",
    "doc": "The success story of aid groupsin developing countries often includes a line about lifting people out of poverty. But what if the data behind such claims was suspect? That\u2019s the contention of economist Morten Jerven at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Jerven, a noted skeptic of African development statistics, says it\u2019s a case of the \"PR department getting ahead of the knowledge department.\" For 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, \"we simply do not have data to say anything about trends in poverty,\" Jerven wrote recently. As fact-checkers, we at PolitiFact can be asked to rely on the data Jerven is calling into question. So we decided to put his claim to the test. It takes two data points to tango Jerven based his claim on a simple law about measuring things: If you want to spot a trend, you need to have a starting point and an end point. Importantly, you need to measure the same thing at both times. To give a crude example, if one year you ask people how much they earn and 10 years later ask them how much their entire household makes, you can see how it would be difficult to make comparisons and draw conclusions. The World Bank identified problems with the data points for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. \"By 2012, only 27 of the region\u2019s 48 countries had conducted at least two comparable surveys since 1990 to track poverty,\" a 2016 report said. Do the math, and you get Jerven\u2019s 21 countries without a starting and an end point on poverty. Andrew Dabalen, lead economist in the World Bank\u2019s Poverty and Equity Global Practice, doesn\u2019t quibble with Jerven\u2019s statement, at least not too much. He and his colleagues vet the data that comes out of Africa. In some countries, such as Liberia and Sudan, there\u2019s just one survey. Somalia has none. Kenya has four, but each was too different from the others to make any firm conclusions. Where do surveys run into issues? They might not match because they drew from different areas -- say a national sample versus urban residents. Some had people fill out daily diaries, while others asked people after the fact to remember what they bought or produced for themselves. Simply taking a survey at different times of the year, harvest versus planting season, could radically change the results. \"Based on the review using these criteria, we find that indeed 21 countries did not have at least two comparable surveys to say something about trends,\" Dabalen told us. Keeping things consistent is not a trivial issue, or a new one. In the mid 1990s, India shifted from asking people what they consumed in the past month to what they consumed in variety of time periods -- from as short as one week to as long as a year. Virtually overnight, the official number of people in poverty fell by about 200 million, a result that many analysts challenged. Even in the United States, scientists often fret anytime the U.S. Census Bureau debates or discusses changing the questions it asks, for fear that it will jeopardize useful data. Filling in the gaps Confronted with missing data, Dabalen and his colleagues have a few workarounds that can help in some places. Numbers for an entire nation\u2019s economy, its gross domestic product, are generally available. Dabalen said you can use GDP trends to estimate household consumption, and from that, derive a poverty level. \"Such a method has its issues, but it is used widely and under certain assumptions, it predicts reasonably well,\" Dabalen said. But it\u2019s not perfect. Branko Milanovic, senior scholar and specialist in global inequality at the CUNY Graduate Center, said the most you can learn from GDP is how things changed on average. If most of the economic growth flowed to the wealthy, the poor might gain little. (The income gains of the top 1 percent to 5 percent in the United States in recent years is a good example.) \"A change in the mean does not tell us anything about the change in the distribution,\" Milanovic said. Dabalen told us about other techniques that derive missing numbers from a range of surveys that can tie economic well-being to other measures such as spending on food, housing conditions or education levels. On a large scale, looking at an entire region, this statistical alchemy can at least show the direction of change. This World Bank chart tracks results for 48 Sub-Saharan nations. The blue line is based only on countries with solid, comparable data. The other lines rely on something less than that. So policy makers can have a sense of the trends in poverty, even if they can\u2019t say for sure what the poverty level is. But again, that\u2019s from a regional vantage point. For any single country with very limited data, these techniques get dicey. According to the World Bank, the use of alternative surveys to fill in missing information sometimes showed poverty going down, when based on more reliable numbers, it was actually going up. Steps are under way to deal with the larger data problem, but a lot of work remains. Oddly, the lack of hard data doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that poverty is worse than we think. Dabalen and his colleagues wrote that a number of crosschecks of all the information \"support the notion that poverty reduction may have been larger than assumed.\""

    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that Texas will have more money in its rainy day fund than the other 49 states combined is false. According to the latest information available, Texas's projected reserve balance at the end of the 2015 fiscal year is $8 billion, while the sum total of reserves in California, New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, Florida, and Indiana alone exceeds Texas's projected reserve balance. Furthermore, Alaska has a larger rainy day fund than Texas, with a projected balance of $11.4 billion compared to Texas's $8 billion. Therefore, it is clear that Texas will not have more money in its rainy day fund than the other 49 states combined.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article supports this conclusion. The National Association of State Budget Officers report shows that states have made progress rebuilding budgetary reserves since the Great Recession, but Texas and Alaska are the only two states with significantly higher reserve balances than the other 49 states combined. Additionally, the Pew Charitable Trusts report provides further evidence that Texas's projected reserve balance of $8 billion is not enough to surpass the combined reserves of all other states.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick's statement that Texas will have more money in its rainy day fund than the other 49 states combined is an unintentional error, according to his office. This error highlights the importance of accurate and reliable information when making claims about state finances. In this case, the evidence suggests that Texas's reserve balance will not be significantly higher than the combined reserves of all other states.",
    "doc": "Texas state government can afford tax cuts and targeted investments and will still have billions of dollars left over, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told Austin radio station KLBJ AM. In the Feb. 25, 2015 interview, which we caught online, Patrick said: \"We are in the best financial shape of any state in the country. We\u2019ll have about $11 billion or so in our rainy day fund by the end of our fiscal year. That\u2019s more money in reserve than the other 49 states combined.\" This fiscal year runs through August 2015. Could it be that Texas will have more money in its rainy day fund than all other states combined? We emailed Patrick\u2019s office to seek the basis of his statement and to gauge if he was trying to make an uncheckable prediction\u2014rather than a flat factual statement. We also looked for the latest information on each state\u2019s expected fiscal-year-end reserves. The Texas state comptroller, Glenn Hegar, issued his two-year state revenue forecast in January 2015. Hegar said the state\u2019s rainy day fund will have a balance of nearly $8.5 billion when fiscal 2015 ends Aug. 31, 2015. Hegar projected the fund to grow to $9.8 billion a year later and to $11 billion through August 2017. Per Patrick\u2019s statement, then, all the other states together should be expecting to end their 2015 fiscal years with less than $8.5 billion, combined. Texas, Alaska outpace other states An online search led us to a fall 2014 report by the National Association of State Budget Officers initially making us think Patrick was onto something. In the report, The Fiscal Survey of States, a section headlined \"Year-End Balances\" said that generally, states have made progress rebuilding budgetary reserves since revenues plummeted during the Great Recession of 2009-10. State budgets passed into law for the 2015 fiscal year show reserve balances nationally totaling $53.1 billion, the report said. And, the report said, \"a disproportionate share of state budget reserves are concentrated in Alaska and Texas, which account for $20.6 billion or 38.8 percent of states reported total balances in fiscal 2015.\" Pew official For more perspective, we sought guidance from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which in July 2014 issued a report on how states might build rainy day funds. By email, spokeswoman Sarah Leiseca passed along analyst Brenna Erford\u2019s conclusion--drawing on Fiscal 50, a Pew interactive breaking out the fiscal status of each state--that Patrick got it wrong. At the moment, per Pew, Texas has $10.3 billion in reserve funds (rainy day funds plus ending balances) providing enough for state government to operate for 79.1 days. \"The only state with more reserve funds currently is Alaska, with $13.3 billion, providing enough for the state to operate for 181.9 days,\" Erford said. SOURCE: Online interactive, Fiscal 50, Pew Charitable Trusts (chart received in an email from Sarah Leiseca, communications officer, Pew Charitable Trusts, attributing information to research by Brenna Erford, manager, state budget policy team, Pew Charitable Trusts, Feb. 26, 2015). Going forward, Erford noted, the NASBO fall 2014 report indicates Texas projecting a reserve balance of about $8 billion through the end of the 2015 fiscal year, which would run second to the projected year-end reserves for Alaska, $11.4 billion. \"According to these data, the sum total of reserves in California, New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, Florida, and Indiana, is greater than Texas\u2019 reserves, providing clear evidence, Alaska withstanding, that Texas\u2019 reserves are not more \u2018than the other 49 states combined,\u2019\" Erford said. NASBO charts With a nudge from Michael Leachman, a state budget expert at the Washington, D.C.-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, we spotted charts in the NASBO report indicating the 50 states together in fall 2014 were projecting 2015 fiscal-year-end reserves, meaning regular balances plus rainy day fund set-asides, of about $53 billion--with Texas accounting for $10.7 billion of that and Alaska $10 billion and other states all together projecting nearly $32 billion in ending reserves. An adjoining chart indicates Texas ending fiscal 2015 with $8 billion in its rainy day fund alone compared to other states together winding up with about $34 billion in such funds. Texas appears to have bigger balances than many states. But its predicted totals don\u2019t dwarf all other states\u2019 projected savings combined. Patrick: \u2018Unintentional error\u2019 After we looked over the charts, Patrick\u2019s office told us Patrick made \"an unintentional error\" in the radio interview. By email, spokesman Alejandro Garcia said Patrick takes pride in the state stockpiling reserves, but he\u2019d meant to talk up jobs created in Texas versus jobs created in all other states combined \"as he ad-libbed the comment.\""

    "doc": "In the wake of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya and protests throughout the Middle East over the YouTube video that disparaged Mohammad, some critics of U.S. foreign policy have questioned the aid we give to such countries. One was Barry Hinckley, a Republican running against U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse.A Sept. 14 story posted on 630WPRO.com reports: \"Hinckley said a poll conducted in Egypt revealed that 80% of Egyptians oppose receiving foreign aid from the United States.\"The story headlined \"Hinckley calls for elimination of U.S. aid to Libya, Pakistan, and Egypt,\" which Hinckley references on his Facebook page, quotes the candidate as saying, \"It makes absolutely zero sense to further burden our own economy to give billions of dollars to a country that doesn't even want it.\" said Hinckley.He said Whitehouse characterized the idea of cutting foreign aid to Egypt as a \"blunder.\" \"I believe that it is a far greater blunder to continue sending billions of dollars to nations that violently attack American lives and property,\" Hinckley says in the story.We gave Hinckley a False ruling in April when he asserted that President Obama gave $1.5 billion to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood (that's the amount of aid going to Egypt, most of it to the military), so we were interested in whether 80 percent of Egyptians really do want U.S. aid to stop.We e-mailed Hinckley's campaign manager and spokesman, but didn't get a response.So we went looking ourselves, and found a Gallup poll conducted in Egypt between Jan. 31 and Feb. 7. The key question: Do you favor or oppose the U.S. sending economic aid to Egypt?The survey of 1,000 Egyptians, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points, found that 82 percent opposed U.S. aid, a rate that has been growing since Gallup began asking the question in April 2011, when 52 percent were opposed.The survey also found that the results don't just apply to aid from the United States.Opposition to aid from international organizations such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund went from a low of 32 percent in September 2011 up to 57 percent during the February 2012 survey. Opposition to aid from other Arab governments has been increasing as well, but not to the point where more Egyptians oppose it or support it. The rate of opposition went from 22 percent in September 2011 to 39 percent in the February poll.Why the growing opposition?Gallup said in its March 29, 2012, analysis that public antagonism toward the aid rose after non-government, pro-democracy groups from the United States and Europe, working in Egypt, were accused of illegally accepting foreign funds and trying to foster unrest.As the Gallup report says, \"The murky circumstances and arrangements that resulted in the prosecution, travel limitations, and then sudden departure of U.S. citizens facing trial in Egypt has only inflamed Egyptians' sense of distrust and suspicion regarding such organizations and what U.S. funds mean for Egyptian sovereignty.\"Forty-three people from those groups, including some Egyptians, were accused of such things as paying activists to incite protests in Egypt to destabilize the country. The latest survey was done shortly after they sought refuge in the U.S. embassy and before many were allowed to leave the country after posting bail.We also found a second study that asked the question in a different way but produced a similar response. That poll of 1,000 Eyptians, conducted March 19 to April 10 by the Pew Research Center, found that 61 percent said both U.S. military and economic aid have a harmful effect on Egypt. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.2 percentage points."

    "doc": "As more people are infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, many are wondering: Am I next? The odds may not be in our favor, according to a recent Facebook post. \"Harvard scientists just predicted that it may take many months to find cure for coronavirus,\" the March 10 post says. \"According to them, virus is spreading so fast that it will infect 70% of humanity this year.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Spokespeople for Harvard University did not immediately reply to PolitiFact\u2019s emails asking about the post. But news stories lend some credence to the Facebook post\u2019s claims \u2014 and provide more information that the post fails to mention. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic that has infected nearly 120,000 people worldwide. More than 4,000 people have died and eight countries, including the United States, are currently each reporting more than 1,000 cases. Mark Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard\u2019s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics and an expert on viruses, told CBS News, among other news outlets, that 40% to 70% of the world\u2019s adult population could be infected in the coming year. There are an estimated 7.6 billion people in the world, and an estimated 329 million in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Adults make up about three-quarters of the U.S. population. \"That is a projection,\" Lipsitch said during the March 2 interview, \"so we will find out if that\u2019s accurate as things go on. It is the best estimate that I\u2019ve been able to make based on a combination of the mathematical models that we use to track and predict epidemics.\" Other estimates are similar.

On Feb. 13, Bloomberg reported that Ira Longini, an adviser to the World Health Organization, said two-thirds of the world\u2019s population could catch COVID-19. But the publication also quoted David Heymann, an infectious disease expert at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, explaining that researchers need more data to get a better idea of how far the coronavirus could spread. \"The models will be refined as more information comes to light,\" he said."

The superintendent also carries out policies set by lawmakers, the governor, and members of the state Board of Education appointed by the governor from the state's 14 congressional districts. The article highlights some of the recent superintendents who have made headlines, including Linda Schrenko, who went to prison for stealing federal funds, and Kathy Cox, who proposed striking the word \"evolution\" from the state science curriculum.\n\nRep. Dudgeon's proposed constitutional amendment would require approval of two-thirds of the state House and Senate and could not go before voters until 2016. The amendment aims to change the method for selecting state school board members, though the specifics are still being developed. Dudgeon argues that Georgia's current system, with an elected state superintendent and an appointed state school board, doesn't make sense as the state is electing an administrator and appointing people who make the policy, which is opposite the normal way it works.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that Rep. Dudgeon's claim that \"In 38 states, the state school superintendent is appointed by either the governor or the state school board\" is true. The article provides support for this claim by listing 37 states with appointed superintendents and only 13 states with elected superintendents, including Georgia.",
    "doc": "Georgia voters have twice refused to amend the state constitution to allow for an appointed -- rather than elected -- state school superintendent. But those votes took place roughly 30 years ago (1984 and 1988), and that old idea could have new legs if state Rep. Mike Dudgeon, a Republican from Johns Creek, has his way. On the eve of last month\u2019s general election, Dudgeon announced on Facebook that he would be pushing a similar constitutional amendment in the General Assembly session that starts in January. \"This is not about who is or is not elected to the position tomorrow but about governance,\" he wrote on Facebook. In 38 states, the state school superintendent is appointed by either the governor or the state school board, Dudgeon said in an interview published Nov. 18. It only makes sense that Georgia would follow the other states\u2019 lead, he said. PolitiFact decided Dudgeon\u2019s claim merited a closer look. First, a little background about the job of state school superintendent. In Georgia, it\u2019s an elected position paying $127,000 a year with largely administrative duties -- mainly running the state Department of Education, which has 786 employees and a $9.6 billion annual budget. The superintendent also carries out policies set by lawmakers, the governor and the members of the state Board of Education who are appointed by the governor from the state\u2019s 14 congressional districts. Some of the more recent superintendents have made headlines, including Linda Schrenko, who went to prison for stealing federal funds, some of which she spent on a facelift; and Kathy Cox, who proposed striking the word \"evolution\" from the state science curriculum. Cox was back in the headlines in 2008 as a $1 million winner on the popular game show \"Are you Smarter than a 5th Grader?\" She promised her winnings to schools for the disabled, but creditors in a bankruptcy related to her husband\u2019s failed home construction business had other ideas. John Barge, the current Republican superintendent, sparred with Gov. Nathan Deal over a constitutional amendment on charter schools, then ran unsuccessfully against him. Barge made a rare cross-party endorsement of Democrat Valarie Wilson, who lost this year\u2019s superintendent\u2019s race to Richard Woods, a Republican and retired South Georgia teacher and school administrator. Dudgeon\u2019s proposed constitutional amendment would not affect Woods. It would require approval of two-thirds of the state House and Senate and could not go before voters until 2016, Dudgeon told PolitiFact. But do most states really have appointed state superintendents? And is Georgia really in the minority with an elected one? We reached out to the Council of Chief State School Officers and the Education Commission of the States, two groups that keep such data. Their records show 37 states with appointed superintendents and 13 states with elected superintendents, including Georgia and Wyoming. Wyoming was not counted in an ECS PowerPoint that Dudgeon relied on from earlier in the year that\u2019s recently been updated, ECS staff told us. Wyoming is currently debating whether to move from an appointed to an elected superintendent. The outgoing superintendent there was threatened with impeachment and lawsuits and removed last year, though her duties were later reinstated by the state Supreme Court, according to news accounts. Dudgeon said Georgia\u2019s current system, with an elected state superintendent and an appointed state school board, doesn\u2019t make sense. \"We are electing an administrator and appointing the people (the state school board) who make the policy,\" he said. That\u2019s opposite the way it normally works, Dudgeon said. His constitutional amendment would change the method for selecting state school board members, though the specifics are still being developed. \"My preference is that they not all be appointed by the governor,\" Dudgeon said. A similar constitutional amendment was filed but not pursued in the General Assembly in 2001 by Phil Gingrey, then a state senator and now a member of the U.S. House. Georgia\u2019s local school districts were traditionally run by elected superintendents, but that changed as of 1996. The Georgia School Boards Association is on record in support of an appointed state superintendent and nonpartisan state board with one member elected from each of the state\u2019s 14 congressional districts."

While she did vote against an $858 billion bill, this does not necessarily mean she supported raising taxes by that amount. The issue is more complex than the ad suggests, and it is unfair to make such a straightforward claim without providing a more nuanced understanding of the issue. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate.",
    "doc": "There was never any doubt that opponents of U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, a Madison Democrat running for the U.S. Senate, would brand her as a liberal who loves taxes.On the day Baldwin announced her candidacy in September 2011, Republican Senate candidate Tommy Thompson called her the most liberal member of the House.Based on annual ratings of House members\u2019 votes, we gave Thompson a Mostly True on that claim.Now two major business organizations say Baldwin loves taxes enough to raise them \"by $858 billion\" -- and they cite Baldwin\u2019s own website as evidence.A politician touting an $858 billion tax increase?This could get interesting.The claim is made in a TV ad sponsored by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and paid for by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The ad was released Feb. 9, 2012.It begins with a narrator saying:\"Washington has made things tough for job creators. More red tape doesn't help. \u2018Obamacare\u2019 will kill jobs; Tammy Baldwin fought hard for it. Taxes? Tammy Baldwin thinks they're too low and wants to raise them.\"At that point, a message on the screen reads: \"Tammy Baldwin -- raise taxes by $858 billion\" and lists Baldwin\u2019s official House website as the source.Is it an accurate attack?\u2018Bush-era tax cuts\u2019The Wisconsin business group referred us to the U.S. Chamber, which referred us to the taxes page on Baldwin\u2019s website. It discusses her vote against an $858 billion bill that extended what are known as the Bush-era tax cuts.The tax cuts -- on income, capital gains, dividends and business -- were enacted in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush. They were temporary -- their major provisions were to expire at the end of 2010.The bill Baldwin voted against was adopted and signed into law in December 2010. On the web page cited by the chamber, Baldwin says she supported continuing the tax cuts only for families that earn up to $250,000, because \"adding $858 billion to the national debt just to give a special tax break to those with incomes over $250,000 is fiscally irresponsible.\"The ad\u2019s claim about Baldwin is based on that single no vote.But, as we\u2019ll see, it wasn\u2019t the only measure put to a vote in the House on extending the Bush tax cuts. And the $858 billion figure -- though widely cited -- is more complicated than presented in the ad.What\u2019s in the $858 billionThe law extends the Bush tax cuts two more years -- but it also provided a new, temporary payroll tax cut, made other tax changes and extended unemployment benefits for 13 months.The total \"cost\" of the package -- in terms of how much it adds to federal budget deficits -- is estimated at nearly $858 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.About $721 billion of that is reduced revenue from the tax changes -- including $408 billion from the two-year extension of the Bush tax cuts -- and the rest is from additional spending.So, does Baldwin\u2019s vote against an $858 billion bill composed primarily of tax cuts mean she supported raising taxes by $858 billion?Not exactly.Had Baldwin\u2019s side defeated the bill -- and had the Bush tax cuts been allowed to expire -- the people who benefited from those tax cuts would have been paying higher taxes as of January 2011.But, as we\u2019ve noted, the bill also contained other measures such as the new cut in payroll taxes and the extension of unemployment benefits. So, it can\u2019t be argued that taxes would have been raised by a full $858 billion had Baldwin\u2019s side prevailed. Secondly, had the $858 billion bill been defeated, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the debate would have ended and that the Bush tax cuts would have expired; another bill could have emerged.Baldwin campaign spokesman Phil Walzak pointed out that a week before the vote on the $858 billion bill that became law, Baldwin voted for an alternative that would have extended the Bush tax cuts, permanently, for families earning less than $250,000. The failed measure also would have made other changes that would have added a total of $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Nearly all of that, $1.34 trillion, would have been revenue lost from making most of the Bush tax cuts permanent.To compare the two bills only in terms of extending the Bush tax cuts:The bill Baldwin voted against reduces revenue by $408 billion for two years, or $204 billion on an annual basis.The bill Baldwin voted for would have reduced revenue $1.34 trillion over 10 years, or $134 billion per year. So, Baldwin supported extending most of the Bush tax cuts, although taxes would have gone up for families earning $250,000 or more.In the end, there were two votes on competing proposals. By using the approach the ad uses, Democrats would be able to argue that those who voted against the first, more limited package, opposed cutting taxes."

According to the article, 4,618 inmates will enter the last year of their sentences by April 30, 2021, and of those, 2,933 are considered violent offenders under parole abolition laws passed by the General Assembly in 1995.

The Democratic-led General Assembly did approve a budget amendment allowing for the early release of inmates with less than a year left on their sentences due to concerns about COVID-19 in state prisons, and a significant portion of these inmates are convicted of violent offenses. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate.",
    "doc": "Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, says Democrats in the General Assembly have opened prison gates for the early release of thousands of violent felons. \"VA Democrats authorized for early release over 4,000 violent felons, 60% of which are incarcerated for violent offenses,\" he posted on his Facebook page on April 28. Freitas repeated the charge that day at a virtual town hall meeting, laying the blame on Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. \"There was one governor\u2019s recommendation that came down where he was advocating for the option of early release for over 4,000 people that have been incarcerated,\" he said. \"Sixty percent of the people that he was advocating be eligible for the program were actually incarcerated for violent offenses.\" .We fact-checked the statements by Freitas, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the Seventh District congressional seat held by Democrat Abigail Spanberger. His statements are based on a budget amendment the Democratic-led General Assembly approved on April 22 at Northam\u2019s request. Concerned about the spread of COVID-19 in state prisons, Northam asked the legislature to allow the Department of Corrections to release inmates with less than a year left on their sentences. The emergency leniency does not apply to inmates convicted of capital murder or sexually violent crimes. Freitas did not respond to three requests we made for his source on the number of inmates who would become eligible for early release and the percentage who had committed violent crimes. His information likely came from Del. Robert Bell, R-Albemarle, who got data from the Department of Corrections and shared it with colleagues. Numbers The department said 4,618 inmates will enter the last year of their sentences by April 30, 2021. Of them, 2,933 - or 64% - are considered violent offenders under parole abolition laws passed by the General Assembly in 1995. We\u2019ll subtract 172 inmates convicted of sexual crimes and ineligible to go early. That leaves 4,446 inmates who would be eligible for early release. Of them, 2,761 inmates - or 62% - are legally classified as violent offenders. Among their ranks: 3 were convicted of second degree murder; 65 of manslaughter; 102 of kidnapping; and 1,386 of assault or robbery. The Department of Corrections uses a more lenient definition of violent crimes for sorting inmates. Under its terms, the offenses of inmates who could be freed early breaks down this way: 1,928 committed violent crimes, or 42%; 1,606 committed property crimes, or 35%; 1,080 convicted of drug-related or public order crimes, or 23%; and 4 inmates\u2019 who are unclassified. Not all eligible inmates will get out early. The DOC says each eligible person will be screened. Among other things, the department will consider an inmate\u2019s crime, health, conduct in prison, recidivism risk and plans for work and shelter if released. As of May 18, 195 people have been freed early. DOC statistics show as of May 19, 900 inmates and 73 prison employees have tested positive for COVID-19. Five inmates have died from the virus. Freitas, during his town hall podcast said he and other GOP lawmakers are open to an emergency early release of people convicted of \"minor crimes,\" but not violent offenders."

    "justification": "The claim made by Indiana Governor Mike Pence that \"Today, there are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before in the 200-year history of the great state of Indiana\" is accurate in terms of raw numbers, but it is misleading when looked at from a percentage perspective. The evidence provided in the article shows that while the absolute number of people working in Indiana has increased over time, the percentage of the population working has actually decreased slightly.\n\nThe article provides data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that in May 2016, there were 3.07 million people working in Indiana, which is the highest number ever recorded. However, when looked at in terms of percentage of the population, the number of people working has actually decreased slightly over time. According to the Census Bureau's 2015 population estimate, the total population of Indiana was around 6.48 million, which means that 47.3% of the population was working in 2016. This is lower than the percentage of people working in 2000, when 49.7% of the population was employed.\n\nFurthermore, the article provides additional evidence that the increase in employment numbers may not necessarily be a sign of a strong job market. The unemployment rate in Indiana is currently 5%, which is considered good by most economists' standards. However, this rate has been around 5% for much of the time between 1993 and 2008, indicating that the current rate may not be particularly exceptional.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that more people are going to work in Indiana than ever before in history, it is misleading to make this claim without also considering the percentage of the population working. When looked at from a percentage perspective, the number of people working has actually decreased slightly over time. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "At what was widely seen as a vice presidential tryout, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence warmed up a Donald Trump rally in his home state on July 12, 2016. Pence took the opportunity in the national spotlight to tout the health of his state\u2019s economy, saying, \"Today, there are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before in the 200-year history of the great state of Indiana.\" With Pence potentially on the verge of becoming Trump\u2019s running mate, we decided to take a closer look at what Pence said. We discovered that the statistic, as Pence stated it, is accurate \u2014 but close to meaningless. Pence has a point that more people in Indiana are working today than at any time in history -- 3.07 million in May 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here\u2019s a chart showing BLS data for Indiana as far back as the database goes online: However, the historical peak Pence cites has more to do with long-term population growth than with the robustness of the economy. The more accurate way to look at a statement like this is to look at the percentage of people working, not the raw number. Otherwise, you could say that President Barack Obama at the depths of the Great Recession was presiding over a healthier job market than Ronald Reagan in his second term, because 25 percent more Americans were working at the nadir of the Great Recession. The difference was that the base U.S. population -- rather than job prospects -- grew substantially in the interim. As a general rule, \"focusing on the total number of people employed is misleading,\" said Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs site Indeed. So let\u2019s take a look at what happens if you calculate the percentage of the Indiana population that is working. According to the Census Bureau\u2019s 2015 population estimate \u2014 the most recent one available \u2014 Indiana has a population of about 6.48 million. So 47.3 percent of Indiana residents were working this year. By contrast, at the previous raw-number peak in Indiana employment -- May 2000 -- there were 3.02 million residents working. That year, the state had 6.08 million residents, so the percentage working was 49.7 percent. In other words, a bigger percentage of Indiana\u2019s population was working in 2000 than in 2016. That throws some cold water on Pence\u2019s assertion. These calculations use all Indiana residents as a baseline, regardless of age, but the same pattern holds if you just look at Indiana residents between the ages of 18 and 64, the prime working years. Currently, 75.4 percent of Indiana residents in that age range are working. In 2000, the comparable figure was 80.5 percent. So by this measure, too, Pence is wrong about 2016 representing a historical peak. Then there\u2019s the more traditional measure of the health of the job market, the unemployment rate. This statistic uses as its baseline the number of people who are looking for a job, which makes it even more precise and in most cases more useful to economists. Indiana\u2019s current rate of 5 percent is what experts would generally consider good, but it\u2019s hardly a historical low for Indiana. For most of the time between 1993 and 2008, Indiana\u2019s unemployment was right around 5 percent and often even lower. Here\u2019s a chart going back to 1976: Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, noticed another pattern in the numbers. He used federal data to determine that even though the state\u2019s working-age population grew by 311,000 between 2000 and 2015, the number of people actually working in the state increased by far less over that period -- only 45,400. That does not seem like an obvious sign of a strong employment trend."

    "doc": "Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger wants the public to pay for her campaign, according to Nick Freitas, her Republican challenger this fall. \"Washington Democrats love to spend your money,\" says a Freitas TV ad. \"They even voted to spend public public funds on their political campaigns; up to $5 million each for travel expenses, staffers, even TV ads. And Abigail Spanberger voted with them, not you.\" The ad flashes grainy videos of three Democrats often targeted by conservatives: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff of California, and Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. It ends with videos of Spanberger. The narrator says, \"Washington Democrats and Abigail Spanbereger: They flood your TV with attack ads; you get stuck with the bills.\" We fact checked whether Spanberger voted to give politicians up to $5 million for their campaigns. A similar claim against Spanberger was made last month in a TV ad by the conservative Congressional Leadership Fund. The charge is cropping up in ads against incumbent Democrats in races across the country. The ads target votes that Spanberger and other House Democrats cast on March 8, 2019 for the \"For the People Act of 2019,\" a 705-page bill that would expand voting rights, limit gerrymandering, strengthen ethics rules and reduce the influence of private donor money in politics. Spanberger was among 236 Democrats who cosponsored the measure. It passed the House on a starkly partisan 234-193 vote, with all participating Democrats supporting it, and all participating Republicans voting no. The bill has not been taken up in the GOP-controlled Senate. Campaign financing proposal The bill would provide a 6-to-1 match for small-dollar donations ($200 or less), and create a pilot program in three states to provide $25 vouchers for eligible voters to give to their favored candidates for Congress. Freitas\u2019 ad gives the impression that everyone running for federal office would get public funding, but that\u2019s not the case. Participation in the program would be optional. A candidate would have to agree not to accept any single contribution of more than $200, and any aggregate donations from an individual or PAC of more than $1,000. Each of those contributions, and voucher money, could receive the 6-to-1 match. To qualify for the program, a candidate would have to raise at least $50,000 in small-dollar donations from at least 1,000 individuals. Ray La Raja, professor of political science and an expert in campaign finance at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has told PolitiFact that the eligibility requirements would make the matching program attractive to some candidates more than others. \"My hunch is that many Democrats would participate under the reform, but probably not those who expect highly competitive elections,\" he said. \"They would not want to risk coming up short of money for the campaign.\" \"Additionally, candidates who have ideological followings will likely benefit from this program,\" he added. \"Ideological candidates tend to draw more small donors.\" Freitas and other Republicans say the bill would allow up to $5 million in public financing for a candidate. The figure comes from a Bloomberg Government estimate in January 2019. Who pays for the funding? Freitas\u2019 ad tells viewers \"you get stuck with the bill,\" suggesting the general public would pay for the matching funds. That\u2019s not correct. The money actually would come from a new \"Freedom From Influence Fund\" under the U.S. Treasury, which would collect a 2.75 percent surcharge on criminal and civil fines and penalties or settlements with banks and corporations that commit corporate malfeasance. It should be noted, however, that the source of money for the matches was not specified in the version of the bill that Spanberger and other Democrats co-sponsored on Jan. 9, 2019. The fines against banks and corporations were added to the bill on March 5. The final bill seals off the possibility that individual and household taxpayers\u2019 money would seep into the fund. It says if the Freedom From Influence Fund runs out of money, no money can be drawn from other sources. The bill allows payments for vouchers and grants to be reduced if the fund runs low."

    "justification": "The claim \"Mitt Romney 'paid only 14 percent in taxes \u2014 probably less than you'\" is Conflicting because the evidence provided shows that the statement may or may not be accurate. The ad from President Barack Obama's campaign continues to drumbeat that Mitt Romney is a privileged rich guy who isn't paying his fair share of taxes, but the evidence provided suggests that it's possible that Romney paid a higher effective tax rate than what was mentioned in the ad.\n\nThe first piece of evidence provided is Romney and his wife Ann's 2010 tax return, which showed $3,009,766 in federal income tax paid on $21,661,344 in adjusted gross income - an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent. While this evidence supports the claim that Romney paid less than 14 percent in taxes, it doesn't necessarily mean that he paid less than most Americans.\n\nThe second piece of evidence is a study by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, which shows that many people, particularly at the lower end of the income scale, actually have negative rates because they get back more from the government than they paid in taxes. This suggests that Romney's 14 percent effective tax rate may be lower than what most Americans pay.\n\nHowever, the study also shows that when payroll taxes are included, the combination of employee and employer payroll taxes actually exceeds income tax payments for all but the top one-fifth of earners. This means that Romney's overall tax rate may be higher than what was mentioned in the ad, possibly exceeding 14 percent.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment on whether Mitt Romney paid less than 14 percent in taxes - the claim could be accurate or inaccurate. Therefore, the label Conflicting is appropriate.",
    "doc": "A new ad from President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign continues the drumbeat that Mitt Romney is a privileged rich guy who isn't paying his fair share of taxes. \"You work hard, stretch every penny,\" a narrator says. \"But chances are, you pay a higher tax rate than him: Mitt Romney made $20 million in 2010, but paid only 14 percent in taxes \u2014 probably less than you.\" We wondered whether it\u2019s accurate to say that Romney \"paid only 14 percent in taxes \u2014 probably less than you.\" The 14 percent figure checks out. The 2010 tax return released by Romney and his wife, Ann, showed $3,009,766 in federal income tax paid on $21,661,344 in adjusted gross income -- an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent. But what do ordinary Americans pay? If you just look at income taxes, Obama is incorrect. Here are the average effective tax rates for Americans in different slices of the income spectrum, according to a study by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. These figures show that many people, particularly at the lower end of the income scale, actually have negative rates because they get back more from the government than they paid in taxes. Bottom fifth of earners: -12.3 percentSecond-to-bottom fifth: -4.2 percentMiddle fifth: 4.1 percentSecond-highest fifth: 8.2 percentHighest fifth: 17.3 percent Because these percentages are average tax rates for broad income brackets, we don't know precisely how many Americans paid more than Romney\u2019s 14 percent effective tax rate. Still, we can make an educated guess that perhaps 20 percent to 30 percent of taxpayers exceeded Romney\u2019s tax rate for income taxes alone. That\u2019s far from most, making the ad\u2019s claim incorrect. However, there\u2019s another way to calculate it: Adding in payroll taxes. Payroll taxes fund Social Security and Medicare, with half paid by the employee and half by the employer. Social Security taxes are 6.2 percent of an employee\u2019s first $110,100 of salary, while Medicare taxes are 1.45 percent of their entire salary. Because self-employed people pay the employer\u2019s half too, and because employees of a company are assumed to be paying the employer\u2019s share indirectly through lower wages, tax analysts typically include both halves when calculating the employee\u2019s tax burden. Counting only income taxes, as we did above, ignores a large chunk of what most people pay in federal taxes. In fact, for all but the top one-fifth of earners, the combination of employee and employer payroll taxes actually exceeds income tax payments, according to the same Tax Policy Center study. We should note one obstacle: We don\u2019t know exactly how much Romney paid in payroll taxes. However, based on the amount and types of income listed on his tax return, even a generous estimate wouldn\u2019t budge his overall tax rate much above 14 percent, so we think it's reasonable to make this kind of calculation. So what happens when you add payroll taxes to income taxes? Obama's ad is accurate. Here's the breakdown when you include income taxes and both sides of the payroll tax (the parts paid for by employee and employer): Bottom fifth of earners: 1 percentSecond-to-bottom fifth: 7.8 percentMiddle fifth: 15.5 percentSecond-highest fifth: 18.7 percentHighest fifth: 24.3 percent Once again, we can\u2019t know exactly what percentage of Americans paid a higher effective tax rate than Romney's 14 percent, but the top two ranges, plus a significant share of the middle group, most likely did. So probably more than half exceeded Romney\u2019s rate, making the Obama ad accurate. Even though this method validates the Obama ad, it\u2019s worth noting that -- contrary to the ad\u2019s invocation of Americans who \"stretch every penny\" -- it\u2019s actually the wealthiest half of Americans, not those with low or middle incomes, whose tax rates end up exceeding Romney\u2019s. At the same time, we should also note that Romney\u2019s 14 percent tax rate is quite a bit lower than the average tax rate for those in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of U.S. taxpayers -- those who earn roughly $2.2 million in cash income and up. Their average tax rate for income taxes alone was 23.6 percent. For income tax plus payroll tax, it was 24.7 percent."

    "doc": "Opponents of Florida\u2019s medical marijuana amendment have fired up a new round of attacks, claiming there will be a dispensary on practically every corner if voters approve the initiative. In a three-minute ad released May 16, 2016, the group Vote No On 2 calls Amendment 2 \"a scam to legalize pot.\" Should the measure pass, they say, it\u2019s likely that places to buy medical marijuana will outnumber two well-known retail outlets. \"Looks like Amendment 2 will put almost 2,000 pot shops in Florida ... more pot shops than Walmart and Walgreens combined,\" the video says. It goes on to deride California medical marijuana regulations and users, and implies Florida would become like the Golden State if the measure passes. While polls say medical marijuana is enjoying about 80 percent support among voters, Vote No On 2\u2019s figures spark an interesting point. Would the number of medical marijuana dispensaries outnumber Walmarts and Walgreens locations in Florida? That's possible, according to one state estimate, but the figures are a little hazy. Dispensary data Amendment 2 was first on the ballot in 2014 but narrowly lost the 60 percent required to pass. The current version for the November 2016 ballot has the same name, but United for Care, the group behind the measure, altered the language to address some concerns that hounded the 2014 amendment. The amendment now requires parental consent and doctor certification for minors and more clearly defines the medical conditions it covers: cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis \"or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated,\" with a doctor\u2019s recommendation. It works like this: If a patient with one of these conditions gets the okay from a doctor, they (or a certified caregiver) will get a state-issued ID card and be able to go to a state-regulated dispensary to buy their marijuana. Doctors technically can\u2019t prescribe marijuana because it is still a Schedule I drug under federal law, meaning it\u2019s considered highly addictive and has no known medical benefits, and is therefore illegal. Doctors would risk losing their ability to practice medicine. Pharmacies also can\u2019t legally distribute cannabis, making dispensaries necessary. So how many dispensaries would there be? The proposed amendment leaves the details of medical marijuana regulations up to the Legislature and the Florida Health Department. Legislators would need to pass a bill for medical marijuana and the health department would develop and enforce regulations. In essence, there could be as few or as many dispensaries as the state wants. There\u2019s only one estimate for how many patients and dispensaries there would be \u2014 a 2015 health department analysis. That report used Florida Department of Economic and Demographic Research data to estimate 440,552 patients in Florida would qualify for medical cannabis. The amendment would lead to 1,993 registered treatment centers, the health department said. That\u2019s the figure Vote No On 2 is using in its ad. United for Care doesn\u2019t dispute the figures, because the health department\u2019s analysis is the only study that\u2019s been done. \"It\u2019s the best educated guess that we have,\" United for Care director Ben Pollara said. \"It\u2019s up to the Department of Health and the Legislature. \u2026 It could be 2,000, it could be 20. It could be 5,000.\" In any event, 1,993 dispensaries would outnumber all the Walmarts and Walgreens in Florida. Vote No On 2 spokeswoman Christina Johnson said the group chose those businesses to illustrate how ubiquitous dispensaries would be should the amendment pass. The video correctly shows 840 Walgreens drug stores in the state, but includes 191 Walmarts, a figure apparently derived from a January 2007 list from Reclaim Democracy, a group seeking limits on corporate influence in government. A more recent list from Walmart shows 223 supercenters and 10 discount stores. (Neighborhood Markets and Sam\u2019s Club stores are not included in either count.) While Walmart and Walgreens do have pharmacies, we\u2019re not convinced pitting small medical cannabis dispensaries against big chain retailers is a fair comparison. It may be better to compare so-called \"pot shops\" to the overall number of pharmacies. The state health department told us there are 9,725 licensed pharmacies in Florida. To provide more context for the dispensary estimate, we will note that the state Department of Business and Professional Regulation says Florida has 2,082 active licensed veterinary clinics \u2014 and 1,893 package liquor stores. Mile-high estimate With so little spelled out in the proposed amendment, we wondered how the health department arrived at its estimate of 1,993 dispensaries. The health department told us they used Colorado, with about 5.3 million people, for the analysis because the state has allowed medical cannabis for years and has a broad baseline of data. The report says there are 515 licensed medical marijuana centers as of October 2015 (there are 528 now, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue) serving almost 114,000 patients. Analysts then scaled that up to Florida\u2019s population of 20 million. Karen O\u2019Keefe, director of state policies and the pro-legislation Marijuana Policy Project, said of the 24 states and the District of Columbia allowing medical marijuana, it\u2019s misleading to use either Colorado or California as examples for Florida. Not only did Colorado decriminalize recreational marijuana use in 2012 \u2014 its 421 retail shops are counted separately from medical dispensaries \u2014 but both states lacked the kind of initial regulatory oversight Amendment 2 would require. \"California dispensaries still have no state licensing or regulation to speak of, though a regulatory and licensing law should be phased in by 2018,\" O\u2019Keefe said in an email. \"In Colorado, regulations went into effect in 2010-11, but hundreds of dispensaries pre-dated them.\" A better state to look to would be New Mexico, O\u2019Keefe said, because it required a licensing program in its law when it passed. New Mexico had 23 dispensaries for its 2 million residents, and expanded that to 35 in 2015. Extrapolating Florida\u2019s total based on New Mexico\u2019s regulations would net far fewer dispensaries, O\u2019Keefe said. If it were based on total land area, Florida could limit the number to about 16. If there were the same number of dispensaries per capita as New Mexico, there could be about 340. \"I really can\u2019t say how many are likely, since it will depend on many factors, with the primary one being regulations. But I would bet it\u2019s far less than 2,000,\" O\u2019Keefe said."

This provides further evidence that the pay gap has significant consequences for women's financial security and well-being.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim \"Women in Oregon are paid 79 cents for every dollar paid to men\" is true.",
    "doc": "The economic equity issues that proved pivotal in the 2012 presidential campaign are again shaping up as big factors this year. Both major parties are pushing to make sure their talking points prevail. Democrats cite statistics showing a yawning pay gap between men and women, with Republicans countering that young women are out earning men in some urban areas. The Claim The National Partnership For Women & Families, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, released a new analysis April 8, 2014, to coincide with Equal Pay Day. It cited U.S. Census data showing that women who work full time in Oregon are paid 79 cents for every dollar paid to men -- a claim PolitiFact Oregon has investigated previously and found solid. But it went further. If the wage gap were eliminated, it said, \"a working woman in Oregon would have enough money per year for 2,877 gallons of gas, 72 more weeks of food for her family or nearly 12 more months of rent. We wondered if the specific pieces of the claim were on the money. The Analysis The basis of the group\u2019s claim comes from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey. It lists, state by state, median annual earnings for year-round, full-time workers and draws on statistics from 2012, the most recent year available. Men in Oregon earned $47,402, compared with $37,381 for women, according to the data. That\u2019s 79 cents on the dollar and adds up to a gap of $10,021 a year. The gap persists for a variety of reasons, said Mary King, a Portland State University economics professor, including a gender division of labor under which \"women\u2019s jobs\" are paid less, lack of strong family-leave policies, and women disproportionately ending up in low-paying retail and service work. Satisfied that women do earn 79 cents for every dollar earned by men -- the gap would be 21 cents -- we emailed Sadie Kliner, the National Partnership for Women & Families\u2019 communications director. She directed us to a separate fact sheet. Gasoline prices, according to the sheet, were provided by Oil Price Information Service in cooperation with Wex, Inc. A gallon of regular gas in Oregon currently costs $3.697, it read. We checked that against AAA Oregon/Idaho\u2019s website, which shows regular gas in Oregon right now averaging $3.69 per gallon. Then we did the math, dividing the wage gap of $10,021 by $3.69. The group claimed a woman could buy 2,877 gallons, but we found closing the gap would enable a woman to buy only 2,715 gallons. We contacted Kliner again, who noted that Oregon\u2019s gas prices were $3.48 when the fact sheet was prepared in early March. A check of AAA\u2019s gas-price information confirmed Kliner\u2019s point. We moved on to the 12 months worth of rent piece of the claim. The group, citing data from the Census\u2019s 2012 American Community Survey, put the median cost for rental housing in Oregon at $862 a month. It showed a margin of error of plus or minus 8 percent. Independently verifying that number wasn\u2019t easy, since no county or or state organization tracks it. We called Multifamily NW, whose members manage more than 150,000 rental units from southern Washington to Medford. Jonathan Clay, the association\u2019s research and communications analyst, pointed us to a semi-annual survey released in October. Two-bedroom, one-bath units averaged $818 per month across the metro area, according to the survey, putting it within range of the margin of error in the Census data. We calculated that $10,021 would pay for 11.5 months of rent, just over half a month shy of the group\u2019s original claim of 12 months. Again contacting Kliner about the discrepancy, she noted that the group rounded the figure up, using the word \"nearly\" to account for the difference. Finally, in assessing food costs, we noted that the original claim said \"72 more weeks of food for her family.\" While the claim didn\u2019t specify the number of children, we settled on two. We then checked the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s website, which publishes monthly food plans representing a well-rounded diet at four different cost levels. Drawing from the low-cost plan, two children could be fed on $97.50 per week. Food costs for an adult female would bring the family\u2019s weekly total to $144.90. That compares with the $139.10 per week for the 72 weeks in the group\u2019s pay-gap claim."

    "doc": "Wes Riddle, who seeks to represent a new congressional district twisting from western Hays and Travis counties north to a sliver of Tarrant County, fired up a crowd last year by suggesting President Barack Obama was making history in a crummy way.Riddle, a retired Army lieutenant colonel now poised for a July 31, 2012, runoff with former Texas Secretary of State Roger Williams for the Republican nomination in the district, spoke at the Oct. 22, 2011, Austin Lone Star LiberTEA Fest rally, according to a DVD distributed by his campaign.\"Ronald Reagan said that status quo is Latin, Latin for the mess we're in,\" he said. \"And folks, we are in a heck of a status quo, let me tell you. How is that hope and change going for you? Are you better off than you were three years ago?\"A moment later, Riddle added: \"The misery index is the highest that it's been since Ronald Reagan took over from Jimmy Carter.\" Memorably, Reagan cited the \"misery index\" -- meaning the nation\u2019s combined inflation and unemployment rates -- as an indicator that Carter merited replacement; voters agreed.We looked into whether Riddle was right that as of October 2011, the misery index was higher than at any time since Reagan became president.Online, we found a website showing the misery index for every month since January 1948. Economist Arthur Okun, an adviser to President Lyndon Johnson, devised the index. \"A combination of rising inflation and more people out of work implies a deterioration in economic performance and a rise in the misery index,\" the site says. In a June 3, 2011, article, our friends at FactCheck.org pointed out that the index hit monthly highs of 13.63 under President Truman in January 1948; 17.01 in President Nixon's last full month in office, July 1974; 19.9 under President Ford in January 1975; and a record 21.98 under President Carter in June 1980.When Reagan won election, inflation was the prime mover of the index, though unemployment has been dominant lately. In April 2012, for instance, the index was 10.4, based on 8.1 percent unemployment and the inflation rate of 2.3. That was down from the highest index on Obama\u2019s watch, 12.87 in August and September 2011, according to the index website.We checked Riddle\u2019s claim against the index site, learning that he did not account for the misery index in the early part of Reagan\u2019s presidency.The site, registered to NPA Services, Inc., in Richmond Hill, New York, says it collects unemployment rates from the U.S. Department of Labor and inflation rates from InflationData.com. By email, the site\u2019s webmaster, John Naudus, told us he maintains the site in his spare time. We spot-checked annual unemployment and inflation figures for the decades at issue. Naudus\u2019s site aligns with the unemployment rates on the labor department\u2019s site and annual inflation figures on inflationdata.com.According to the misery index site, the index in Carter\u2019s last year as president, 1980, was 20.76. In every subsequent year through 2011, the index was less than that.With Obama as president, the index increased from 8.94 in 2009 to 12.11 in 2011, according to the misery index site. However, that was not the highest index since Reagan succeeded Carter. According to the site, the index was higher than Obama\u2019s one-year high of 12.11 each of the first three years of Reagan\u2019s presidency: 17.97 in 1981, 15.87 in 1982 and 12.82 in 1983.For greater precision, we looked at the index month by month. This enabled us to compare the index in October 2011, when Riddle spoke, to the index for every previous month starting with Reagan\u2019s presidency.The October 2011 misery index was 12.43, based on the 8.9 percent unemployment rate plus the month\u2019s 3.53 percent inflation, according to the site.And does that 12.43 misery index outpace any such index since Reagan succeeded Carter?Hardly. According to the site, the index was higher in a couple of earlier months of Obama\u2019s term and barely higher, at 12.60, in November 1990, when George H.W. Bush was president.Arguably, these instances are close enough for comfort.Still, Reagan experienced higher misery indexes at the start of his presidency. The index exceeded 14 for Reagan\u2019s first 25 months as president, according to the index site, and remained greater than 13 from February through May 1983.By email, Brad Heritage of Riddle\u2019s campaign sent a statement from Riddle saying the government changed how it calculates inflation and unemployment after 1980 and as a result, the index is lower of late than it would have been before the changes. A Bureau of Labor Statistics economist, Jacqueline Midkiff, told us the bureau does not agree that methodology changes weaken or invalidate unemployment rate/inflation rate comparisons across decades. She pointed out an August 2008 bureau article on inflation-rate myths and a 1994 bureau paper including information on comparing jobless rates over time."

    "doc": "If the rollout of the Obamacare website had gone well, we likely would be closer to having an answer to the all-important question: How much are people paying for health insurance and is it more than they did before? But for now, getting reliable answers can be treacherous. Conservative talk radio and Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity waded into the discussion on his radio program. A caller voiced frustration with the lack of jobs. Here\u2019s the conversation that followed: Hannity: You know what the biggest job killer in the country is right now? Obamacare. Caller: One thing that can't be argued is that insurance premiums are too high. Hannity: They are skyrocketing. They are skyrocketing. I mean, in 45 out of 50 states, on average men are seeing their premiums double, going up 99 percent. Women up 62 percent. That's the average. Are Hannity's numbers right? Hannity\u2019s staff told us the numbers came from an article in Forbes that provided the analysis of some number crunching by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative New York think tank. But Hannity's on-air statement went further than the report itself and included a common mistake. He lumped in people who purchase insurance on their own with people who receive it through their employer. The study focused explicitly on the insurance rates people can expect to encounter in the online marketplaces, which makes up less than 10 percent of the total private insurance market. Of that small subgroup, Hannity also failed to acknowledge that federal government subsidies will reduce many people\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses, at least partially offsetting higher premiums. The Manhattan Institute study The Manhattan Institute analysts went through a complex process to estimate how premiums under Obamacare compared to premiums before the marketplaces opened. It drilled down to the county level in all 50 states and used a federal government website to gather health insurance prices in 2013 (before the Obamacare rollout). It looked at rates for 27-, 40-, and 64-year-old male and female non-smokers and adjusted prices upward to account for anyone who was denied coverage or had some health problem that would increase their rates. Then, the researchers looked at the prices for plans in the marketplaces for comparable individuals. The results were daunting. \"The cheapest exchange plan for the average enrollee, compared to what a 40-year-old would pay today, will cost an average of 99 percent more for men, and 62 percent for women,\" the study said. The Manhattan Institute analysis refers only to people buying insurance through the marketplaces, which is called the \"individual market.\" This is in contrast to the way that most Americans, about two-thirds, get insurance. They get coverage through their employer. The number of people in the individual market is expected to grow under the new health care law but right now, they represent less than 10 percent of people with insurance. We should note that the Manhattan Institute analysis relies on knowing how much people pay for insurance today, before Obamacare. That is something that a leading health policy research center has declined to do. The Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Larry Levitt said there are several reasons not to compare cost before and after Obamacare. Part of the challenge is the new health care law requires that insurance plans include more services than many do today, such as maternity care and mental health coverage. That means the plans people will buy in 2014 are not the same as the ones they bought in 2013. And because the coverage is changing, apples-to-apples comparisons are challenging. Levitt said another major obstacle to before-and-after comparisons is that reliable data is unavailable. Insurance companies would have a key piece, but they keep it to themselves. \"There is not good information about what people pay in the individual insurance market today,\" Levitt said. \"And we certainly don\u2019t know what types of plans people are going to choose after reform. Generally, Kaiser has predicted that premiums will be \"somewhat higher\" in the individual market than what they are today. The additional services come at a price. In addition, no one can be denied due to a pre-existing condition. Insuring them will tend to increase an insurance plan's costs. That might be offset if plenty of younger, healthy people also join the insurance pool, a stated goal of Obamacare but also one of the great unknowns. Federal subsidies The Congressional Budget Office, the research arm of Congress, projects that about half the people buying health insurance through the marketplaces will be eligible for subsidies in the form of tax credits. The more money you make, the less the subsidy. No subsidies are available for an individual making more than $43,000 a year, or a family of four making about $92,000 a year. The Manhattan Institute average rate increases for men and women did not factor in any subsidies."

While some studies have found a significant increase in the risk of pre-term pregnancy associated with prolonged standing, others have found no link or only a small increase. For example, the 1995 study mentioned in the article found a 20% increase in the risk of premature delivery among women who stood for five hours per day, which is significantly lower than the claimed 80%.\n\nSecondly, the definition of \"prolonged standing\" can vary greatly between studies, which makes it difficult to compare results. This lack of standardization means that the claim of a 80% increase in risk may be based on different criteria than other studies.\n\nThirdly, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has stated that the evidence for a significant increase in the risk of pre-term pregnancy associated with prolonged standing is weak. In fact, ACOG has suggested that the risk may be lower than previously thought, with some studies suggesting a link only at very high levels of standing (e.g., more than 6 hours per day).\n\nFinally, the article quotes Dr. Raul Artal, chairman of the department of obstetrics, gynecology and women's health at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine in Missouri, who states that the worst position for a pregnant woman is standing and being motionless.

While some studies have found a small increase in the risk of pre-term pregnancy associated with prolonged standing, the evidence is not conclusive, and the claim should not be taken at face value.",
    "doc": "On April 3, 2014, legislation intended to protect pregnant women from workplace discrimination and safeguard the health of both the mother and child was introduced before the Providence City Council. It called for accommodations such as extra break times and the right to transfer to lighter duty. Arguing in support of the legislation, Council President Michael Solomon, a co-sponsor, said in a news release, \"Pregnant women who stand for five or six hours at a time increase their risk of pre-term pregnancy by 80 percent.\" Pre-term pregnancy means a woman gives birth before 37 weeks -- about eight and a half months -- of pregnancy; 37 to 42 weeks is considered normal. Currently about 1 in 8 babies are born pre-term in the United States and they account for about 35 percent of infant deaths. We knew that studies have shown that most physical activity does not pose a risk during pregnancy, but we were unaware that prolonged standing could hike the risk of prematurity by 80 percent -- which is almost double the normal risk. In his news release, Solomon attributed the information to the Women's Fund of Rhode Island. We are fact-checking his statement because, although he clearly cited the source of his information, public officials are still responsible for the statistics they repeat. Solomon released a statement defending the idea behind the proposal, saying, \"Providing reasonable accommodations and taking common sense steps to protect the health of pregnant women and their babies is the right thing to do.\" He did not offer any evidence to support the 80 percent statistic. As it turns out, the issue has been studied for years and the findings have been all over the map, with some researchers discovering a risk comparable to 80 percent -- and sometimes greater -- but most finding a much smaller risk, if any risk at all. Also, the definition of \"prolonged standing\" can vary from study to study, which can make it hard to compare studies. \"The Face of Pregnancy at Work\" page on the Women's Fund website essentially has the same claim Solomon made: \"Women who stand for 5 to 6 hours at a time increase their risk of pre-term delivery by 80 percent.\" It lists no source. A spokeswoman promised to get back to us with more information. Meanwhile, we called the 57,000-member American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which sent us some material that raised questions about the 80-percent claim. For example, the American College sent us a 1995 study that involved women who stood at work for longer periods -- in this case five hours per day. They were 20 percent more likely to have a premature delivery than pregnant workers who stood for two hours or less each day. That's significantly lower than 80 percent. An overview of such studies was published in 2000 in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology. It combined the results from 14 studies published between 1983 and 1998. Eight found no link between prolonged standing (defined as more than three hours a day, not five or six hours), two showed a clear link and three showed a barely significant increase. The studies from the mid-1990s onward tended to show no link. Overall, the researchers calculated, prolonged standing increased the risk by 26 percent. When the people at the Women's Fund got back to us, they directed us to the summaries of seven studies. Some were part of the Obstetrics and Gynecology analysis (which was included in their list). There were also some more-recent examinations of the question. One found no significant risk for premature delivery for women standing more than seven hours a day. A second found that the risk was 69 percent greater. A third, a 2004 report in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, found that a woman would have to stand for more than six hours a day to produce a significant risk. Doing so increased the chances of preterm birth by 26 percent. It was the same degree of risk seen among women who reported that the satisfaction of their job was low. However, in the countries where the infant mortality rate was low and women could take long prenatal leaves, standing for more than six hours did not increase the risk at all. When it comes to body posture, \"the worst position a pregnant woman can be in is standing and being motionless,\" said Dr. Raul Artal, chairman of the department of obstetrics, gynecology and women's health at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine in Missouri. A woman who is on her feet but moving around doesn't face the same risk, he said. \"Actually, I would encourage women to walk around.\" Instead of a risk that's 80 percent higher, an estimate in the 20-30 percent range \"is much more reasonable,\" said Atral, who edits the Clinical Updates in Women's Health Care for ACOG. In general, \"healthy pregnant women should be encouraged to continue to live a normal life,\" he said. We also note for the record that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a list and poster of things a woman can do to prevent a pre-term delivery. Avoiding prolonged standing is not listed as a big risk factor."

    "doc": "Recent positive developments in the United States\u2019 relationship with Iran proves that President Barack Obama was right, and Hillary Clinton was wrong, said Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders. On Jan. 17, 2016, Obama announced that Iran released several American prisoners, among other diplomactic achievements, includinga legal settlement over a military equipment dispute.NBC\u2019s Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Sanders Jan. 17 if he thinks Iran is still an enemy of the United States. \"It\u2019s funny,\" Sanders replied. \"If you think back to 2007 during the campaign in which Secretary Clinton ran against Barack Obama, she was critical of him. A question was asked to Obama that said, \u2018Would you sit down and talk to the Iranians?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yeah, I would.\" Point being, you talk to your adversaries. You don\u2019t run away from that. Secretary Clinton, I think, called him naive. Turns out that Obama was right.\" Clinton and Obama\u2019s back-and-forth on Iran and other foreign policy issues was a main feature of the 2008 Democratic primary. At one point, Clinton did call Obama\u2019s position on Iran diplomacy \"naive,\" but Sanders is leaving out important nuance that misrepresents her position at the time. Fighting words This all started at a July 2007 Democratic presidential debate, where CNN took questions from YouTube users. One user asked, \"Would you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?\" Obama was the first to respond, saying, \"I would. And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them, which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of (the George W. Bush) administration, is ridiculous.\" (Obama made similar comments throughout the campaign.) Clinton also answered the question, saying she agreed that she would approach adversaries differently than the Bush administration and \"get back to diplomacy.\" But she distinguished herself from Obama by saying she, as president, would not necessarily meet with these leaders in her first year, without any preconditions, which is what the YouTube question asked specifically. Instead, she would first send envoys. Clinton\u2019s \"naive\" comment came the next day in an interview with the Quad-City Times in Iowa. \"I think it is wrong for any president to say he or she will not talk to people because they\u2019re bad or evil,\" she said. \"But the question was very specific, asking whether either of us would talk to a list of leaders of five countries with which the United States has serious difficulties within the first year of becoming president, and I thought that was irresponsible and frankly naive to say he would commit to meeting with Chavez and Castro and others within the first year. As I said last night, there has to be a lot of diplomatic effort.\" Sanders\u2019 made it sound like Clinton shut the door on diplomacy, when in reality she was supportive of diplomacy, though she advocated for a more cautious approach than Obama. Competing memos from both campaigns emphasized this distinction, and the two candidates argued about it at another primary debate. At the time, we gave Obama a Mostly False rating for claiming that Clinton \"agrees with (John McCain) in embracing the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like.\" Clinton clearly said she would approach diplomacy differently than the Bush administration. It\u2019s worth noting that Obama did not personally meet with Iranian leaders in his first year. It wasn\u2019t until 2013 that he spoke over the phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani \u2014 the highest-level talks between the two countries in 30 years. Obama did announce in April 2009, four months into his first term, that the United States and five other countries would engage in talks with Iran \u2014 the P5+1 group that eventually negotiated the nuclear deal. For her part, Clinton as secretary of state was personally involved in diplomatic efforts to increase global sanctions on Iran that helped move the nuclear deal forward."

This suggests that per-student spending has increased over the past 16 years, rather than remained relatively flat.\n\nTherefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the evidence presents conflicting views on whether per-student spending has remained relatively flat or increased over time.",
    "doc": "An Austin Democrat critical of the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court for upholding the legality of the Texas school finance system asserted that unless lawmakers act, per-student spending will lag what it totaled more than a dozen years ago. In a press release circulated May 13, 2016, the date of the court\u2019s decision, state Rep. Celia Israel urged Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special legislative session to \"fully fund public education.\" Israel went on: \"When adjusted for inflation, per-student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years. Despite that trend, Texas schools in 2017 will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003.\" Is all of that so? Israel cites Center for Public Policy Priorities To our inquiry, Israel\u2019s chief of staff, Jennie Kennedy, said by email that Israel relied on an April 2016 report by the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank that advocates lawmakers on issues affecting low-income Texans. We turned to the report, \"The Texas School Finance Challenge and What to Do About It,\" which has a nearly identical spending claim, stating: \"When adjusted for inflation, per-student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years. Despite that relatively flat spending trend per student, Texas schools in 2017 will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003.\" Over the years, a chart in the report indicates, total per-student spending was relatively flat, ranging from a 2013 inflation-adjusted low of $9,813 per student to a 2009 high of $11,621. From 2002 through 2017, the chart suggests annual average per-student spending of nearly $10,479 -- meaning $273 less than what was spent in 2003 and $108 more than expected spending in 2017. And, as Israel said, the $10,371 in expected spending in 2017 would run $381 less than the shown $10,752 in per-student spending in 2003. Indeed, per the chart, that 2017 spending will run behind per-student spending in 10 of the 14 years from 2003 through 2016--though it\u2019s poised to outpace spending in four of the presented years. We realized too you can reach a smaller long-term spending difference--or even an increase--by focusing on a different timeframe. For instance, according to the chart, the expected 2017 spending will lag per-student spending in 2004 by (just) $97--and the expected spending will outrun school spending in 2005 by $111 per student, also exceeding per-student spending in 2012 through 2014--by margins of $262 per student (2014) to $558 (2013). Finally, the shown 2017 spending will run just $4 per student behind $10,375 in spending in 2015 though it\u2019s pegged to be down $69 per student from spending in 2016. SOURCE: Report, \"The Texas School Finance Challenge and What to Do About It,\" Center for Public Policy Priorities, April 20, 2016 We asked the center to show its work; spokesman Oliver Bernstein emailed us the related spreadsheet, which initially prompted us to notice that the presented figures represent 2015 dollars. State spending up? Also, the spreadsheet shows, the center broke out annual changes in local, state and federal spending, also adjusted for inflation. Seemingly dramatic: Some $4,236 per student in school expenditures by state government in 2017 stands to outpace comparable spending in 2003--by $254. In contrast, local spending will be down nearly $600 a student and federal aid will be about $60 per student less than what it was, according to the sheet. What gives? By email, a center analyst, Eva DeLuna Castro, reminded us the uptick in state spending reflects a legislative decision in 2006 to pay down local school property taxes with state aid; that move fuels a continuing cost to the state of $14 billion every two years. In the report, a note below the chart says the center reached its figures by analyzing data from the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budget issues, and Texas Education Agency. So we asked those agencies about the center\u2019s conclusions. Legislative Budget Board analysis By email, TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson said the agency doesn\u2019t make such spending comparisons. But a board staff spokesman, R.J. DeSilva, told us by email that its own inflation-adjusted analysis indicates that in 2017 dollars, Texas schools will have $10,111 in total per-student aid in 2017--up $33 from $10,078 in per-student spending in 2003. DeSilva emailed a chart showing the figures as well as that 3.9 million students attended Texas schools in 2003 with a little more than 5 million expected in 2017. DeSilva wrote: \"The source of the statement you're checking may be using different data points such as measures of inflation or constant dollar year.\" We knew that was right about the dollar year. And when we asked, DeLuna Castro confirmed by email that the center had employed a federal inflation index, the Implicit Price Deflator for state/local government from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the center\u2019s view, DeLuna Castro said, that index better reflects costs to school districts than the general Consumer Price Index applied in the board-provided analysis. \"Why it\u2019s different: Governments are more likely to face the rising costs of health care (teacher health insurance premiums, for example) and of road construction that the CPI doesn\u2019t capture,\" DeLuna Castro wrote. How about it, budget board; wrong inflation index? To the contrary, DeSilva said by email there's no consensus about using the IPD rather than CPI when analyzing education spending. \"The CPI is well-known,\" DeSilva wrote, and the board uniformly employs it to analyze state spending in all areas. Finally, DeLuna Castro emailed us her run at adjusting per-student spending figures by using the CPI to account for inflation. By this approach, public school spending in 2017 stands to outpace per-student spending in 2003 by $148 per student, per the spreadsheet DeLuna Castro shared, though the 2017 spending looks to trail per-student expenditures in 2006-08, 2012, 2015 and 2016."

    "doc": "To bolster their case to reduce the size and cost of government, Republicans often say federal employees are overpaid. During an Aug. 15, 2011, town hall in Litchfield, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney cited salary figures to make the point.\"I found it surprising that over a quarter of federal workers make more than $100,000 a year -- 500,000 federal workers make more than $100,000 a year.'' Romney said.To back up the claim, the Romney campaign cited figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that say the total federal civilian work force is 2.2 million federal employees, not including postal workers. The campaign also cited a USA Today report from July 2011 that said there were \"nearly\" 500,000 workers earning $100,000 or more.We checked with the Office of Personnel Management, which keeps data on federal employees and salaries. According to its Fed Scope database, the total civilian workforce was 2.14 million in June, the most recent month for which information was available. And at that time there were 459,016 federal workers who made at least $100,000 in average base salary each year.That\u2019s a little short of the 500,000 Romney claimed. It accounts for 21.5 percent of government employees, not 25 percent as he said. It's about 22 percent if you just look at \"permanent\" federal employees, which excludes temporary employees, student interns, the legislative and judicial branches along with the Postal Service and the military.\"Governor Romney said over one quarter of federal workers make more than $100,000. He meant to say nearly a quarter,'' said Ryan Williams, a campaign spokesman.Some studies have claimed that government workers earn higher salaries than private-sector workers, but federal officials say that's an apples and oranges comparison. OPM Director John Berry has said the studies fail to recognize that federal jobs require workers who are more educated and need higher skills.John Palguta, vice president with the Partnership for Public Service, a group that encourages people to work in government, said the studies don't prove that federal workers are overpaid.\"There is no convincing evidence that a significant percentage of those federal employees who are paid above $100,000 a year are being paid at a level that is above what major private sector employers pay their employees in similar occupations, with similar levels of responsibility, and which require similar knowledge, skills, and abilities,\u2019\u2019 he said.It's worth noting that studies show federal salaries rose significantly under former President George W. Bush, and then by greater amounts under President Obama."

    "doc": "Wisconsin\u2019s prison system has been in the headlines, from problems at the Lincoln Hills School for Boys, the state\u2019s juvenile facility, to an incident in which a Department of Corrections sergeant exposed the names of confidential informants at the prison in Redgranite. The agency\u2019s troubles have attracted plenty of comment from state lawmakers, including State Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, who tossed in some numbers in a May 21, 2019, tweet. \"Our corrections system didn\u2019t become a mess overnight. It is a result of the last 8 years of neglect where we saw the prison population expand and vacancy rates for correctional officers go from 2.9% to 15.2%.\" Is Taylor correct that Wisconsin has seen an expanded prison population -- and more openings for correctional officers -- over the past eight years? Digging into the numbers As with other criticism from Democrats, there is no coincidence to the eight-year marking point -- that mirrors the time Republicans had total control in Madison. Let\u2019s start with the prison population, and a May 2019 report from the Legislative Audit Bureau. The nonpartisan audit bureau noted the prison population declined from 2009 to 2011 (from 22,672 to 21,941), but has grown since then. As the report notes, \"the inmate population grew from 21,941 in 2011 to 23,675 in 2018, or by 7.9 percent.\" So, Taylor is on track with the prison population What about correctional officer vacancies? According to the May 2019 audit bureau report, the turnover rate for correctional officers increased from 17.8 percent in fiscal year 2013-\u201914 to 26.1 percent in fiscal year 2017-\u201918. \"We found that employee turnover for adult corrections increased from 18.6 percent in fiscal year 2013-\u201914 to 24.0 percent in fiscal year 2017-\u201918,\" the report said. \"The turnover rate for correctional officers increased the most, growing from 17.8 percent to 26.1 percent and varied substantially among institutions.\" That\u2019s fine for what it is, but Taylor\u2019s claim was for an eight-year period. For those numbers, we turned to data from the state Department of Corrections. The department\u2019s data on correctional officer and sergeant vacancies (excluding Wisconsin Correctional Center System sites) from 2011 to 2019 shows steady increases, except for a dip in 2017, in vacant positions: 2011 -- 2.87% 2012 -- 5.49% 2013 -- 6.43% 2014 -- 6.46% 2015 -- 7.62% 2016 -- 11.25% 2017 -- 10.97% 2018 -- 12.36% 2019 -- 15.27% (through May 11, 2019) So, Taylor is on target on that part of the claim as well. What\u2019s behind the numbers? Corrections officials have said the state\u2019s low unemployment rate makes it hard to hire and keep workers. As a result, overtime continues to increase. According to a May 2, 2019,Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report, state agencies spent $80.9 million on overtime in 2018, with most of it \u2014 nearly $50 million \u2014 going to Department of Corrections workers. Daniel Meehan, a retired sergeant at Waupun Correctional Institution, blamed the worker shortage and rising overtime on Act 10, the 2011 law that dramatically curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees. Raising wages won't fix the staffing problem on its own, he told the Journal Sentinel. \"In corrections, the job is undesirable,\" said Meehan, who worked for the Department of Corrections from 1981 to 2015. \"Nobody wants to do it anymore. Nobody\u2019s applying for the job, and the ones that do, quit.\" What\u2019s ahead? On May 2, 2019, Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 administration announced temporary raises of $5 an hour to workers at six prisons in hopes of curbing long-running staff shortages at those institutions. Until at least June 2020, officers and sergeants will get additional pay for shifts at Columbia, Dodge, Green Bay, Taycheedah and Waupun correctional institutions. The bonus will also be paid to workers at Lincoln Hills. These institutions will now pay new workers $21.65 an hour \u2014 30% more than the $16.65 an hour paid to those starting at most Wisconsin prisons. Veteran employees at the six institutions will also get pay boosts of $5 an hour -- an increase of more than $10,000 a year. The move was criticized by some since it leaves out officers and sergeants at more than a dozen other prisons and raised concerns that staff shortages at some institutions would widen if workers decided to transfer to the prisons that are paying more. Meanwhile, under a plan adopted May 22, 2019, by Republicans on the Legislature's budget committee, starting wages for Wisconsin prison guards would go up by more than 14% over two years \u2014 from $16.65 an hour to $19 an hour. More senior officers would also get raises of $2.35 an hour by 2021. Most other state employees would get 2% raises in each of the next two years, as Evers recommended."

    "justification": "The label \"False\" is appropriate for the claim made by Governor Rick Scott in the Florida gubernatorial debate. The evidence provided by PolitiFact Florida indicates that electric rates did not increase by 30% under Charlie Crist's governance, nor did they drop by 11% under Governor Scott's administration. In fact, the base rate went up considerably under Scott, and overall rates are also up since January 2011, despite a significant decrease in fuel reimbursements. The study provided by Edison Electric Institute shows that the average residential bill was not significantly off, and Florida's average monthly bill actually went down during Crist's tenure. Additionally, when Crist entered office in January 2007, the average retail price of electricity for a Florida home was 11.06 cents per kilowatt hour, which is higher than the national average. Therefore, based solely on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that Governor Scott's claim is false.",
    "doc": "After the brouhaha in last week\u2019s Florida gubernatorial debate over electronic fans, there was a heated exchange between Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist on electric rates. Crist, who won the governorship as a Republican in 2006 and is now running as a Democrat, said the Sunshine State needs new investments in solar energy, and the next governor must stand up to the \"utility companies that keep jacking up your bills.\" Scott, the Republican incumbent, shot back that Crist was playing fast and loose with the facts. \"While he was governor, utility costs went up 30 percent and went from below the national average to above the national average,\" Scott said. \"Since I got elected, utility rates have come down 11 percent and now we are below the average.\" There\u2019s two parts to this fact-check: Under which administration were electric bills higher, and how does that compare to the national average? It\u2019s clear from the conversation and the evidence we received from the Scott campaign that he was talking about residential rates. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ll focus on. Understanding electric rates When you get your electric bill, there\u2019s a good chance you only catch the amount telling you what you owe. But that number is made up of two components: the base rate and cost-recovery clauses. The cost-recovery clause is sometimes called the pass-through clause, because costs incurred by a power company are passed through to customers. The base rate, on the other hand, is essentially how companies get a return on their investment. The largest cost-recovery clause is fuel. Power companies charge consumers for the cost of purchasing the coal, natural gas or other energy sources needed to make their plants go. Just like gas prices at the pump change every time you fill up, fuel prices for power companies can be quite volatile. Fuel prices are also, for the most part, out of the control of any governor. Whether power companies can get cheap natural gas is most often a national issue, not a state issue. With that in mind, let\u2019s look at the data. Who saw higher rates? PolitiFact Florida obtained data on electric rates for the four large investor-owned power companies operating in Florida \u2014 Florida Power & Light Co., Duke Energy, Tampa Electric Company and Gulf Power Company \u2014 through an open records request with the state Public Service Commission. The information contained the overall rate as well as the base rate and various cost-recovery clauses. For Florida Power & Light, Duke Energy and Tampa Electric, electric rates in the last eight years peaked during the Crist administration. For those three utilities, the high point came in 2009. But in all three cases, the spike was not caused by an increase in base rates. Indeed, base rates were relatively stable across the board during Crist\u2019s tenure. Instead, the higher electric rates were caused by large increases in fuel recovery costs. Take Tampa Electric Company, for example. The base rate in 2009 was the same as it was the day Crist took office: $51.92 per 1,000 kilowatt hours. But customers were paying $128 per 1,000 kilowatt hours in 2009 compared to $114 in 2007. What changed? The cost of fuel jumped $10 per 1,000 kilowatt hours. This was caused by a steep increase in natural gas prices nationwide, said J.R. Kelly, the public counsel for Florida who represents the people of the state in utility-related matters. \"That\u2019s nobody's fault or the result of any change by any governor or the Legislature,\" Kelly said. \"No matter who was governor, natural gas prices tripled in costs so all the fuel charges went soaring.\" A couple of years later, there was a natural gas boom in the United States, and prices dropped considerably. Power companies also credittheir own moves to build more efficientplants.What happened to electric rates? They fell as well. You can see this all play out in this chart. Source: Florida Public Service Commission What\u2019s notable is that fuel prices for utility companies continued to fall, but the overall electric rate did not drop at the same speed. That\u2019s because the base rate went up as well. Rate changes are approved by the Public Service Commission, a five-member panel made up of gubernatorial appointees. All five current members were appointed by Scott from a list of names pre-approved by a legislative panel. Those five members were also appointedby Crist, though four of his initial choices were rejected by the Republican-controlled Legislature. Base rate increases occurred under both administrations but are considerably higher under Scott. Total monthly bill for residential services in January (in 1,000 kilowatt hours) FPL Duke Tampa Gulf Base Total Base Total Base Total Base Total 2007 38.12 103.51 41.18 110.34 51.92 114.54 49.3 101.87 2011 43.01 95.01 48.58 119.34 55.45 107.02 49.3 122.67 2014 52.47 99.95 58.50 125.29 60.98 109.61 62.09 132.00 Source: Florida Public Service Commission As you can see, not only is the base rate higher under Scott, but overall rates are also up since January 2011, when Scott took over the governorship from Crist. This despite the fact that fuel reimbursements have fallen considerably since 2011. Florida vs. the national average Scott\u2019s campaign told us he got the numbers from a study on residential electric rates by the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor-owned power companies. According to Scott\u2019s campaign, \"the average residential electric bill in Florida (for investor-owned utilities) went from 9.66 cents per kilowatt hour in 2006 to 12.41 cents per kilowatt hour in 2010.\" First, Scott\u2019s numbers are significantly off, based on the studies provided to us by Edison Electric Institute. We quickly found his mistakes. The average residential bill was 9.66 cents per kilowatt hour in 2005, when Jeb Bush was governor. The average monthly rate was 11.61 cents per kilowatt hour in 2006, when Crist was running for governor and 11.43 cents during his first year in office. The average monthly rate also wasn\u2019t 12.41 cents per kilowatt hour in 2010. That was the rate in 2009. As we noted earlier, that was around the time fuel prices spiked. During Crist\u2019s last year in office, the rate was actually 11.18 cents per kilowatt hour, which would mean the average monthly bill actually went down during Crist\u2019s tenure. There also hasn\u2019t been an 11 percent decrease under Scott. Again, that\u2019s based off an incorrect number for 2010. In 2013, the last year of data available, the average monthly rate was 11.06 per kilowatt hour. The study also does not show that rates were higher in Florida than the national average when Crist left office. When Crist came in, Florida\u2019s average monthly bill in 2006 and 2007 was above the rest of the country. But the national average during his final year in office was 12.01 cents per kilowatt hour, higher than Florida\u2019s monthly average of 11.18. In that measure, Florida has stayed below the national average since. Much of this is backed up by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a clearinghouse for national energy statistics, which includes monthly breakdowns for more accurate timelines. When Crist entered office in January 2007, the average retail price of electricity for a Florida home was 11.06 cents per kilowatt hour. When Crist left office in January 2011, the rate was 11.33 cents per kilowatt hour. So it\u2019s up, but hardly by 30 percent. The increase is actually about 2.5 percent. Also, by the time Crist was sworn in, Florida was already above the national average in residential utility rates by a full penny per kilowatt hour. In fact, the state had been above the rest of the country consistently since October2005. While there were points that Florida\u2019s residents paid less than the national average during Crist\u2019s term, Florida rates were higher than the rest of the country when Crist finished his four-year term, though by considerably less than when he came in. What about during Scott\u2019s tenure? The latest figures from June 2014 show Floridians on average pay 11.96 cents per kilowatt hour. That\u2019s up 0.63 cents since Scott took office, or 5.6 percent, a larger jump than during Crist\u2019s term in office. The cost of electricity in the rest of the country has increased at a higher rate than Florida, so Scott is right that Florida is now below the national average, but it\u2019s not because rates have decreased under his watch, as he claimed."

    "doc": "While some conservative activists and presidential hopefuls have trashed Common Core, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush remains a supporter of the education standards. Bush\u2019s support for Common Core could put him at odds with primary challengers should he decide to enter the race: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, opposes Common Core, while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a potential candidate, once showed tacit support but later called for repeal. During an event on April 17 in New Hampshire, a Nashua resident asked Bush straight up: \"Gov. Bush: where do you stand on Common Core?\" Bush said: \"Thank you for bringing that up. If it wasn\u2019t going to be brought up, I was going to bring it up myself.\" Bush then made his case that Common Core is essentially a push for higher standards, to address concerns about student achievement in the United States. \"We have an 80 percent graduation rate in high school after spending more per student than any country in the world other than Liechtenstein I think, or Luxembourg and a couple other small countries,\" Bush said. Bush drew applause when he said \"we don\u2019t need a federal government involved in this at all,\" and added that he supported proposed legislation to ban the feds from creating standards or curriculum. (PolitiFact has rated multiple claims from other politicians that Common Core is a \"federal takeover\" of education and found them misleading.) Here we will fact-check Bush\u2019s claim about the national graduation rate and how much we spend per student compared to other countries. Graduation rates and per-pupil spending There are a few different ways to measure graduation rates including the federal government's cohort method, which examines how many students who enter 9th grade graduate four years later with a standard diploma. By that measurement, the national average was about 81 percent in 2012-13. (Florida is below that national average.) As for spending, Bush\u2019s spokeswoman pointed to a 2013 Associated Press article about a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that compared per-pupil spending among 34 advanced industrialized nations. Formed in 1961, OECD sets international standards on a wide range of topics, including education spending. The most recent OECD study -- from 2014 using 2011 data -- shows that the United States spends $12,731 per student on secondary education. Four countries -- Austria, Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland -- spend more. Those same countries are also the only ones that spend more than the United Statesper student on primary schools. Country Secondary per-pupil spending Austria $13,607 Luxembourg $16,182 Norway $13,939 Switzerland $15,891 United States $12,731 (Bush mentioned Liechtenstein, a tiny country located between Austria and Switzerland, but that wasn\u2019t included on the OECD list.) Pointing to the OECD data, the federal government\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics notes that a country\u2019s wealth is positively associated with expenditures per student. When examining expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product for all levels of education, the United States and Chile are seventh out of 32 countries. Stanford professor Eric Hanushek, an expert on economic analysis of educational issues, told PolitiFact that the OECD ranking is the best source currently available to judge differences among nations in education. However, University of Iowa education professor David Bills offered one caveat. \"What matters is not the absolute budget per se, but the proportion of that budget that is spent on instruction,\" Bills said. Traditionally the United States spends big parts of its educational budget on non-instructional items such as security -- more so than some other nations. Bush has changed how he has worded his claim about how per-student spending in the United States compares to other countries. In 2013, Bush claimed that the United States spends \"more per student than any country in the world,\" which Factcheck.org noted was inaccurate since a few countries spent more."

    "claim": "\"All Aboard Florida is a 100 percent private venture. There is no state money involved.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "Justification: The claim that \"All Aboard Florida is a 100 percent private venture. There is no state money involved\" is misleading. While it is true that All Aboard Florida is a private enterprise, it also takes advantage of infrastructure paid for by the government. Therefore, neither Governor Scott's nor former Governor Crist's statements tell the full story.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article supports this justification. Firstly, the article states that All Aboard Florida will use private financing for a large portion of its costs, but has also applied for a $1.6 billion federal loan. This suggests that there is some level of public funding involved in the project, even if it is not directly provided by the state.\n\nSecondly, the article highlights three points of contention regarding the involvement of state money in the project: the quiet zone funding approved by the legislature for horns at railroad crossings; the possibility of using $44 million in state money to connect All Aboard trains to Tri-Rail; and the use of an intermodal transportation facility at the Orlando International Airport, which will accommodate rail including All Aboard Florida and potentially two other future rail projects. While these points do not necessarily constitute direct state funding, they do demonstrate that the project is connected to government infrastructure and funding in various ways.\n\nFinally, the article quotes a statement from Florida Department of Transportation spokesman Dick Kane, who confirms that no money has been granted yet for quiet zone funding, but notes that local governments have until mid-October to apply for the money. This suggests that while there may not be any state money \"involved\" in the project at present, there is certainly potential for future involvement.\n\nBased on this evidence, it is clear that Governor Scott's claim that All Aboard Florida is a 100 percent private venture with no state money involved is misleading. While it is true that the project is primarily privately funded, there are also connections to government infrastructure and funding that complicate matters. Therefore, we label this claim as Conflicting.",
    "doc": "Gov. Rick Scott has been on the defense for months about All Aboard Florida, a controversial passenger rail project that he supports. All Aboard Florida will run from Miami to West Palm Beach in 2016 and could extend to Orlando the following year. The project has faced opposition from some residents on the Treasure Coast, who fear noise and other impacts. And as he campaigns for re-election, Scott has faced heat for the role of his chief of staff, who previously worked for All Aboard\u2019s parent company. A key point of contention has been about the role of public dollars in the project. In an interview with the West Palm Beach TV station WPEC June 30, Scott said: \"All Aboard is a 100 percent private venture. There is no state money involved.\" Scott made similar claims in June in a letter to the editor in the Tampa Bay Times and at a campaign event in Largo in July. His description of the \"100 percent private venture\" prompted an outcry from the Florida Democratic Party and opponents of the project. Media reports have also outlined the public funding -- and potential public funding -- associated with the project. Earl Barrett of Clearwater wrote a letter to the editor of the Tampa Bay Times in June seeking some clarity: \"A PolitiFact check seems in order.\" Meanwhile, Scott\u2019s likely nemesis on the November ballot, former Gov. Charlie Crist, made a claim that contradicted Scott\u2019s assertion. \"All Aboard Florida is receiving millions in Florida taxpayer dollars,\" Crist wrote in a July fundraising email. As the All Aboard controversy moved full steam ahead in August, we decided it was time for us to subject Scott\u2019s and Crist\u2019s statements to our Truth-O-Meter. What we found is that All Aboard Florida is a private enterprise, but it also takes advantage of infrastructure paid for by the government. So neither Crist nor Scott is telling the full story. Here, we\u2019ll look in depth at Scott\u2019s statement that All Aboard is \"100 percent private\" with \"no state money involved.\" Scott has been asked why he rejected federal funds for high-speed rail in 2011 but now has shown support for All Aboard Florida. Republican Party of Florida Communications Director Susan Hepworth said in statements earlier this summer that the financing was vastly different: \"The proposed high-speed rail would have wasted millions of Florida taxpayer dollars by leaving the state on the hook for an unprofitable project. A private sector project \u2014 of any kind \u2014 not run on state funding obviously doesn\u2019t have the same risks. Anyone saying these two issues are the same is being intentionally dishonest.\" In 2011, PolitiFact Florida fact-checked Scott\u2019s claim that high-speed rail would have cost Florida $1 billion. The state\u2019s portion of the project was going to be $280 million -- Scott based his figure on a suspect study. We rated that claim False. All Aboard Florida All Aboard Florida is a $2.5 billion passenger rail line that will connect Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach in 2016, with hopes to extend to Orlando in 2017. Proposed by Florida East Coast Industries, LLC, All Aboard will use private financing for a large portion of its costs and has applied for a $1.6 billion federal loan. In the TV interview, Scott didn\u2019t mention that federal loan, but his administration has acknowledged in press statements that federal dollars could be part of the project. So there\u2019s definitely federal money involved, but is there state money? We found three points of contention here. Quiet zones: In response to residents\u2019 concerns about noise from All Aboard trains, the Legislature this year approved $10 million in \"quiet zone\" money for horns at railroad crossings. Local government agencies can apply for the money for any rail crossing, not exclusively for those used by All Aboard. Local governments have until mid October to apply for the money so no money has been granted yet, Florida Department of Transportation spokesman Dick Kane told PolitiFact Florida. Tri-Rail: Tri-Rail is an existing government-run passenger rail service in South Florida overseen by the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority. All Aboard mentioned in bond documents the possibility of using $44 million in state money to connect their trains to Tri-Rail, according to the Naples Daily News. While All Aboard and regional transportation officials talked about the idea of state funding, that never materialized and the Florida Department of Transportation officially shot down that idea amid all the publicity. So for now, there is no state money \"involved\" with connecting these two rail services. The Orlando International Airport: This is the most concrete connection between All Aboard and state funding. The airport is building a complex to include the airport\u2019s people mover, parking and ground transportation. Connected to that project, the airport is also building an intermodal transportation facility -- and that\u2019s the piece that will get about $214 million from a loan and grant from the state. The intermodal facility will accommodate rail -- including All Aboard Florida -- and potentially two other future rail projects, Phil Brown, airport director, told PolitiFact Florida. All Aboard Florida will pay the airport $2.8 million a year for a lease, which the airport will use to repay a portion of the state loan. In addition, All Aboard will pay the airport between $1 and $1.50 per passenger. (All Aboard Florida estimates that combined the total will add up to about $4.5 million a year.) \"Whatever they are using of that facility they are going to pay for,\" Brown said. The airport is required under federal regulations to charge fair market rate. \"The funding is for the Orlando International Airport, not All Aboard Florida,\" states a July 25 press release from FDOT. \"The airport will reimburse the state for the portion of funding related to the rail connection, whether it is All Aboard Florida or another private rail provider.\""

Additionally, Mack took two years off from school to work full-time before returning to finish his degree through correspondence classes. This means that it actually took Mack approximately seven and a half years to finish college, rather than exactly seven and a half years.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Connie Mack \"took seven and a half years to finish college\" is accurate based on the evidence provided.

    "doc": "George LeMieux depicts Florida Republican U.S. Senate rival Connie Mack as a man who vaulted from college party boy to congressman. And those college days, well, they lasted awhile, according to LeMieux.In the Web ad \"Two and a Half Macks\" LeMieux says that \"Connie the IV took seven and a half years to finish college,\" while showing a buffoonish-like Mack wearing a T-shirt that says \"Kollege\" and dancing around in front of a University of Florida sign.We\u2019ve already checked other claims in the same February 2012 Web ad including that Mack \"failed to pay his child support\" (False) and whether his only job in the real world was an events coordinator for Hooters (Mostly False). In this item, we will explore how long it took Mack to finish college.Mack won a seat in the state House of Representatives, representing Broward and Palm Beach counties in 2000. He then moved to Southwest Florida and won a seat in Congress in 2004.LeMieux\u2019s campaign directed us to a 2000 article in the Palm Beach Post, which detailed Mack\u2019s route to his college degree:\"Born Cornelius H. McGillicuddy, the younger Mack attended public high school in northern Virginia, transferring in the middle of his junior year to the Massanutten Military School in Woodstock, Va.\"He left the military high school a year later in January 1986, lacking an English credit to graduate, and finished his high school requirement by enrolling that month at Sante Fe Community College in Gainesville.\"He spent 2 1/2 years at the community college and transferred to the University of Florida in May 1988. He graduated from the university five years later, and three months shy of his 26th birthday, with a bachelor's degree in advertising.\"Subsequent news articles have repeated that it took Mack seven years, or seven and a half years, to finish college, including a 2012 Miami Herald article about Mack\u2019s past. The Herald wrote about Mack\u2019s time in college in connection to a legal case stemming from a 1992 bar brawl with professional baseball player Ron Gant. A jury found Gant started the fight but Mack didn\u2019t win the legal damages or fees that he sought. The article stated that \"Gant\u2019s legal team sought to portray Mack as a troublemaking lightweight, noting he went to military school and that it took him more than seven years to get an advertising degree that, ultimately, he parlayed into a consultancy to promote Hooters, the Florida restaurant chain known for its scantily clad waitresses.\u2019\u2019We contacted spokespersons for the two schools mentioned in the Palm Beach Post article.Known as Sante Fe Community College at the time (it\u2019s now called Sante Fe College), Mack started in the spring term of 1986 and graduated in June 1988 with an associates of arts degree, said registrar Lynn Sullivan. That\u2019s about two and a half years.Mack then transferred to the University of Florida in May 1988 and graduated in May 1993 with a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in advertising, UF spokesman Stephen Orlando said. That\u2019s about five years.So the math works. But there\u2019s more to this story.We first asked about the overlap from May-June 1988, when Mack was technically a student at Sante Fe and UF. Orlando, the UF spokesman, said that it wasn\u2019t unusual -- students can be admitted and register for classes with the presumption that they will earn the associate\u2019s degree during that same semester -- in this case, the \"summer A\" semester of 1988.Then there\u2019s the Post reference that Mack was finishing his high school requirements by enrolling in community college. Sullivan, the Sante Fe registrar, told us in an email that she couldn\u2019t provide additional information.Mack campaign spokesman David James says the amount of time it took Mack to finish college depends on PolitiFact\u2019s definition. For starters, Mack was dual-enrolled in high school and college in the spring of 1986 -- so the date he enrolled in community college overlaps technically with the time he would still be considered in high school. On top of that, James said, Mack took two years off from school -- 1991 and 1992 -- to work a full-time sales job. Mack finished school through correspondence classes, earning his diploma in 1993.That information -- at least the part about Mack being away from UF for 1991 and 1992 -- is corroborated through school records.Orlando said that Mack was at UF starting with the \"summer A\" session in May 1988. He continued at UF through the fall of 1990, records show. But Mack did not take classes in 1991 or 1992. He returned for the spring semester of 1993, taking a couple of courses that were not on campus.That means Mack was taking classes at or through UF for about three years, not five."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, the claim that \"One in six Texans don\u2019t have healthcare. We\u2019re the most uninsured state in the U.S.\" is true. The New York Times article quotes Lupe Valdez, a former Dallas County sheriff and candidate for governor in Texas, as saying that one in six Texans lack health insurance. This statement is supported by data from the Census Bureau, which estimated that in 2016, Texas had the nation's greatest share of residents without health insurance, with a rate of 16.6 percent. Additionally, other sources such as Gallup and the Kaiser Family Foundation also found that Texas had the highest uninsured rate among all states. While it is true that some uninsured individuals may receive care through alternative means, such as paying out of pocket or going to emergency rooms, the overall trend of high rates of uninsurance in Texas is evident from multiple sources. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "Lupe Valdez, the former Dallas County sheriff nominated for governor by Texas Democrats, says health care will get much-needed attention once she\u2019s in charge. Valdez was quoted in a May 23, 2018, New York Times news story saying: \"One in six Texans don\u2019t have health care. We\u2019re the most uninsured state in the U.S.\" It\u2019s an exaggeration, we\u2019d suggest, to say that all uninsured individuals don\u2019t have any health care. As we concluded in a 2010 fact-check, many avenues exist to make care available--including paying out of pocket and going to hospital emergency rooms. Still, many people don't get the care they need. A slightly different 1-in-6 statement appears on Valdez\u2019s campaign website: \"1 in 6 Texans lack health insurance,\" Valdez says on the \"Health Care\" portion of the site. She goes on: \"The truth is, we\u2019re already paying for universal healthcare, we are just doing it in the most expensive and inefficient (way) possible.\" Valdez, calling Republican Gov. Greg Abbott foolish for rejecting the option of expanding Medicaid in Texas as permitted by the Obamacare law, further says that as governor she\u2019ll push to reverse his decision. We\u2019ve found validityto other claims that Texas has the greatest share of residents who lack health insurance. After Valdez spoke, we decided to look again at how Texas ranks. Census Bureau estimates Valdez\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to our email asking for her backup. But to our inquiry about the latest available data, Paul Fronstin of the Washington, D.C.-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, who previously advised us on the number of uninsured residents by state, pointed by email to a September 2017 Census Bureau report estimating that in 2016, Texas still had the nation\u2019s greatest share of residents without health insurance, 16.6 percent--or 1 in 6 people. The Texas rate, the report says, was down from 17.1 percent the year before and 22.2 percent in 2013, according to information collected in the American Community Survey. In 2016, the report says, Alaska ranked second nationally with 14 percent of residents lacking coverage and Oklahoma was third with a 13.8 percent uninsured rate. Also answering our query by email, the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Chris Lee shared its calculations indicating that in 2016, Texas led other states with 15 percent of residents lacking health insurance, per research connected to the bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey. According to the foundation, states ranking second and third in residents lacking coverage were Alaska (14 percent) and Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Utah (12 percent each). Lee guided us next to a Kaiser chart showing that Texas in 2016 also had the nation\u2019s greatest share of uninsured residents younger than 65 (when residents qualify for Medicare). The Texas uninsured rate of 17 percent outpaced No. 2 Alaska\u2019s rate, 15 percent, a foundation chart says. Gallup survey results We spotted a more recent nongovernmental estimate. In May 2018, Gallup said that surveys the polling company took in 2017 asked respondents: \"Do you have health insurance coverage?\" For the 10th straight year, Gallup said, Texas had the nation\u2019s highest rate of uninsured residents, 22.5 percent, which was still an improvement from the uninsured rate Gallup gauged for Texas in 2013, 27 percent. In 2017, Gallup gauged, Massachusetts residents had the nation\u2019s lowest uninsured rate in 2017, 4 percent.

    "doc": "Bill Maher, cable show host and ardent atheist, ignited a cable television free-for-all when he said the Muslim world has \"too much in common with ISIS.\" ISIS, of course, is one of the names for the forces of the Islamic State group which has engaged in beheadings and mass executions with ghastly regularity. Liberals have been critical of Maher for, they say, making sweeping generalizations of Muslims. Conservatives, meanwhile, have come to Maher\u2019s defense. On Fox News, host Bill O\u2019Reilly delivered one of his Talking Points commentaries on the question of whether Islam is a destructive force in the world. To a significant degree, O\u2019Reilly answered in the affirmative. Among his reasons -- the governments of Muslim-majority nations have \"failed to confront Islamic terrorism (and) have not attacked violence in the name of Allah.\" O\u2019Reilly then played video that featured Palestinian youngsters jumping and smiling as news spread of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. \"Thousands of Muslims, regular folks, celebrated in the streets,\" O\u2019Reilly said. \"They were happy that more than 3,000 innocent people, including Muslims, were murdered. Again, these people are a minority but they were not called out in any official way by Muslim nations around the world.\" O\u2019Reilly is correct that public demonstrations in support of the 9/11 attacks took place. They largely occurred in the Palestinian territories, although we also found reports of one in Egypt. Middle East specialistPeter Mandaville, associate professor of government and politics at George Mason University, recalls them as \"small scale and localized.\" But our fact-check is focused on the question of whether Muslim nations repudiated the celebrations. \"There was a report of (the) Palestinian Authority information minister at the time, Yaseer Abed Rabbo, appealing to Palestinians to not show happiness in response to the attacks, but no specific condemnation that I know of,\" Mandaville said. We found a couple of compilations of Muslim reaction in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. In addition to Mandaville, we contacted several researchers who study the Middle East. We found no instance when the government of a Muslim-majority nation chastised or condemned the people who were elated by the toppling of the World Trade towers and the other deadly events of that day. What we did find were many official condemnations of the attacks themselves. King Abdullah II of Jordan said, \"What these people stand for is completely against all the principles that Arab Muslims believe in.\" The day after the attacks, Abdelouahed Belkeziz, Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, issued a statement saying he was \"denouncing and condemning those criminal and brutal acts that ran counter to all covenants, humanitarian values and divine religions foremost among which was Islam.\" The Organization of the Islamic Conference (now called the Organization of Islamic Cooperation) represents all of the Muslim nations in the Middle East and worldwide. The group later issued a joint statement that spoke to \"the necessity of tracking down the perpetrators of these acts in the light of the results of investigations and bringing them to justice to inflict on them the penalty they deserve.\" The League of Arab States said much the same thing, as did Islamic religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and other countries. From Syria, Yemen, Pakistan and other nations, over 40 clerics and Islamic-oriented party leaders -- many with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, a movement that advocates for Sharia law -- signed a statement on Sept. 12, 2011, saying, \"We condemn, in the strongest terms, the incidents which are against all human and Islamic norms. This is grounded in the Noble Laws of Islam which forbid all forms of attacks on innocents.\" So while it\u2019s true that governments did not speak out against the jubilant Palestinians, there was broad rejection of the attacks from officials and top religious leaders. Nathan Brown, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, raised the possibility that the street celebrations loomed larger in America than elsewhere. \"I remember them being reported in U.S. media since they seemed so outrageous,\" Brown said. \"But I do not know if they got any domestic attention in the countries where they were reported in U.S. media to have occurred. For instance, I remember Palestinian media reporting the blood donation made by Yasser Arafat but not anything about Palestinian celebrations.\" Arafat had a photo-op with him donating blood to help the survivors of the 9/11 attacks, although later reports questioned whether he actually did. We did find several accounts of the Palestinian authorities attempting to seize video of the demonstrations, which could speak to how the events might have played in the region. Dubai-based Media Watch Middle Eastis a private firm that tracks the activities of news organizations throughout the region. We asked them to look for coverage of the celebrations. They reported that an \"extensive search\" of their database turned up nothing. Apart from official reaction, average Muslims attended candlelight vigils and other public events to voice sympathy for the victims and to repudiate the attacks. We found photos from Iran and Bangladesh. These demonstrations stand in sharp contrast to the video from the Palestinian territories."

    "doc": "A Facebook post falsely claims that a significantly higher number of children were separated from their parents during the Obama administration than under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. \"Did you know 89,000 children were separated from their parents under Obama? ONLY 1,900 children have been separated under Trump. This PERFECTLY exposes the bias of the media,\" said the Facebook post from Aug. 25, with nearly 400 shares. \"Good to know,\" wrote one commenter. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post doesn\u2019t specifically say \"immigrant\" children \u2014 but the national discussion on separated families has centered on children and parents separated at the southwest border as a consequence of Trump\u2019s \"zero-tolerance\" immigration policy. The policy called for the prosecution of immigrants who crossed the border illegally; when adults came in with children, they were separated by immigration officials. Children were transferred over to the care of Health and Human Services Department, and adults taken into federal custody for prosecution. Generally, under Trump and other administrations, immigration officials separate a child from an adult under three conditions: when authorities cannot establish the custodial relationship, when they believe that the custodian may be a threat to the child, or when the custodian is being detained for prosecution. Immigration experts have told PolitiFact that immigrant family separations at the border during the Obama years did not happen at the scale that have under Trump\u2019s \"zero-tolerance\" policy. In November, Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, told PolitiFact that the Obama administration did not count the number of families separated. We don\u2019t know where the Facebook post got its 89,000 figure. It\u2019s possible that it\u2019s a reference to a different set of children \u2014 children who arrived at the border alone without a parent or a guardian rather than those separated from their parents. A 2016 Senate subcommittee report said that since the beginning of fiscal year 2014, Health and Human Services had placed almost 90,000 unaccompanied immigrant children with sponsors in the United States. \"According to HHS, it places the majority of those (unaccompanied alien children) with the child\u2019s parent or legal guardian,\" the report said. Overall, family separations did not happen under the Obama administration as a result of a \"zero-tolerance\" policy like Trump\u2019s, despite Trump\u2019s false claims that both presidents \"had the exact same policy.\" The total number of children separated from their parents under Trump\u2019s administration is unclear because of faulty record-keeping. In June 2018, officials said that at least 2,342 children were separated from their parents between May 5 and June 9 of 2018 as a result of the \"zero-tolerance\" policy. Under a court order, around 2,800 children have been reunited with their parents or otherwise discharged from federal custody."

    "justification": "Based on the provided evidence, it is appropriate to label the claim as True. The Austin school district's chief financial officer, Nicole Conley, testified that the district pays $406 million in recapture payments to the state, which amounts to 38% of the district's budgeted property taxes. Using this figure and the district's average taxable value of a home ($328,844), it can be calculated that the average homeowner in Austin is expected to pay $1,355 towards recapture.\n\nMultiple experts, including former Texas Education Agency official Joe Wisnoski, agreed that the figure of $1,355 is reasonable and accurate. Additionally, the district spokesman, Jacob Barrett, did not question the math when asked to provide a breakdown of how the average homeowner's share of the recapture payment was calculated.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the claim that the average homeowner in Austin is paying $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture is True.",
    "doc": "For years, Austin taxpayers have indirectly helped fund schools elsewhere in accord with the state\u2019s more than 20-year-old system for equalizing aid among school districts, some of which have vast differences in taxable property wealth. Kirk Watson, the Democratic state senator from Travis County, attached an ear-catching figure to those costs during a November 2016 Texas Tribune panel discussion about hot issues in the 2017 legislative session. \"In Austin, Texas,\" Watson said, \"the average homeowner is paying about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture,\" as in funds shifted to less property-rich districts elsewhere. \"And so that\u2019s going to the state to fund state obligations. We have got to look at how we\u2019re doing our school finance system so that we can do right by the people in this state and have a fair and equitable system.\" We asked Watson\u2019s office how he arrived at his figure for how much average Austin homeowners are paying to schools elsewhere. By email, Kate Alexander said Watson relied on September 2016 testimony by the Austin school district\u2019s chief financial officer. According to Nicole Conley's prepared remarks for a Sept. 28, 2016, appearance at a joint hearing of the Texas House committees on appropriations and public education, Conley described the Austin school district as the state\u2019s largest single payer of recapture. \"Our payment alone comprises 13 percent of all state collections,\" Conley\u2019s testimony says. \"During the next five years\u2014between fiscal years 2016 and 2020\u2014Austin ISD is projected to pay almost $2.6 billion in recapture payments to the state. By 2019, more than half of every tax dollar collected in Austin will go to the state.\" Later in her testimony: Conley said: \"So to put it in perspective, we could lower our tax rate by 35 cents if we weren\u2019t sending $406 million to the state under the recapture system. For the average homeowner in Austin, that would amount to about $1,400 in lower taxes. That\u2019s fairly substantial; that\u2019s pretty significant tax relief. That would certainly make Austin more affordable for some of our taxpayers.\" To our inquiry, district spokesman Jacob Barrett told us Conley reached her savings figure for the average homeowner starting from the district\u2019s 2016-17 budget indicating it expects to pay $406 million in recapture to the state in accord with the school funding system. That payment amounts to 38 percent of the district\u2019s $1.061 billion in budgeted property taxes, Barrett noted. Barrett said the district got to the average homeowner\u2019s share of the budgeted recapture payment starting from its average taxable value of a home in the district of $328,844 (as of June 2016) on which such an owner expected to pay $3,548 in school maintenance and operations property taxes at the M&O tax rate of $1.079 per $100 valuation. Finally, Barrett said, multiplying the 38 percent by that $3,548 delivers the portion of taxes on an average-value residence that goes to recapture of $1,355. Barrett also emailed us a December 2012 district document showing that by amount, the Austin district's 2015 recapture payment was followed by what was paid by the Highland Park (Dallas); Eanes; Cotulla; and Karnes City districts, respectively. Also, the document says, the Austin district\u2019s annual recapture payment is projected to exceed $630 million in 2019 when \"more than half of every school property tax dollar collected locally will be \u2018recaptured\u2019 by the state.\" Next, we asked non-district experts--Joe Wisnoski, a former Texas Education Agency official; Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials; and Christy Rome, who advocates for districts required to make recapture payments--to evaluate how the Austin district determined the average Austin homeowner will pay $1,355 in school property taxes toward the district\u2019s 2016-17 recapture total. Solid, each expert said. By email, Wisnoski cautioned though: \"The average doesn\u2019t really describe much about the distribution of payment amounts, so you don\u2019t really know how many taxpayers are clustered close to that amount, and how many are really far away (high or low) compared to the average.\" Finally, we looked into how much a district resident with the median value home might be paying toward its recapture total. For that, we ran the median value of homes in the Austin district as of Aug. 8, 2016--$261,487--through the district\u2019s equation. Result: The median-value homeowner will be expected to pay $2,821 in M&O school taxes, of which $1,078 would be her or his share of the district\u2019s recapture payment. Barrett, the district spokesman, didn\u2019t question our math. He noted, though, that Watson referred to \"the average homeowner.\" It\u2019s fair, Barrett said by email, \"to use the variable that we do.\""

    "doc": "Democrat Charlie Crist has criticized Republican Gov. Rick Scott for the state\u2019s failure to expand Medicaid. During the second governor\u2019s debate, which was held on Oct. 15, 2014, at Broward College, Crist said of Medicaid expansion, \"In addition to the $51 billion it would bring to the state over the next 10 years, some studies indicate it would create about 120,000 jobs. That's the right thing to do.\" That\u2019s nearly double the number of new jobs that Crist cited this summer. If Florida expands Medicaid, would that lead to 120,000 more jobs? Studies about Medicaid and jobs Medicaid is a joint state and federal program aimed at providing health insurance to the very poor. The 2010 Affordable Care Act encourages states to expand eligibility, with the federal government paying 100 percent of the expansion for the first three years, declining to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. The expansion would have led to 800,000 to 1 million additional Floridians signing up for Medicaid. (That\u2019s mostly due to new Floridians who would be eligible and also because some who are already eligible but haven\u2019t signed up would enroll for the programafter publicity.) Scott initially opposed Medicaid expansion but switched his positionin 2013 when he came out in support of it. But Scott didn\u2019t lobby the GOP-led Legislature, which ultimately rejected the expansion. He hasn\u2019t talked about it much on the campaign trail. Studies predicting job growth are based on the idea that as states expand Medicaid, new patients will access medical services they haven\u2019t used in the past. Extra revenue will allow health care facilities to hire new workers. But the number of jobs predicted in each study varies depending upon the methodology. We only found one study that went as high as the 120,000 number Crist cited in the debate. And that study was conducted by a supporter of the expansion. Crist was citing the Florida Hospital Association\u2019s 2013 analysis that predicts about 120,000 jobs. The association commissioned the study done by University of Florida researchers. During the debate, Crist didn\u2019t specify any time frame. Direct jobs accounted for about one-third of the jobs, while the remainder included suppliers or secondary spending, such as when a doctor buys a new house or car. Other studies cited much lower figures for job growth. For example, Moody\u2019s, a financial analysis firm that doesn\u2019t have a position on the health care law, last year predicted Medicaid expansion would create 10,000 to 30,000 jobs over 10 years in Florida. The White House Council of Economic Advisers projected 63,800 jobs between 2014 and 2017 in Florida. That study was part of the Obama administration\u2019s promotion of the Affordable Care Act. The White House study relies in part on the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, in which some residents got Medicaid through a lottery. Research showed people in Medicaid got preventative tests such as mammograms, cholesterol screening and pap smears compared to the control group. The White House predicts that Medicaid expansion would allow tens of thousands of Floridians to get those preventative tests. Experts weigh in on studies So why the massive differences on the job predictions? The numbers vary based on different economic models used and other assumptions. PolitiFact Florida interviewed several experts on the studies after the first debate, held on Telemundo, when Crist made a similar claim about newjobs from expandingMedicaid. Dan White, the senior economist who authored the Moody\u2019s study, said that the hospital association study appears to assume that everyone who signs up under the Medicaid expansion will generate new spending. But at least some of those people who would have signed up for Medicaid were already accessing some medical services -- albeit inefficiently in emergency rooms. \"They are treating all the money coming into Medicaid expansion as new medical spending in Florida, but some of those people are already spending money,\" White said. \"The crux of our analysis is shifting who is paying for it. It might be true that those people support 120,000 jobs, but maybe 10,000 to 30,000 are new jobs.\" Some experts on Medicaid expansion told PolitiFact Florida that an infusion of federal dollars for Medicaid expansion would lead to some job growth, but they questioned pinpointing a specific number. \"Pumping federal dollars into the state is likely to be stimulative, but an exact job calculation (given the many concurrent policy changes) is difficult,\" Harvard professor of health economics Katherine Baicker told PolitiFact Florida. Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it\u2019s impossible to make a jobs prediction. \"I would guess there would be some short-term employment gains, but the long term would be more problematic as bills become due,\" he said. \"But even in the short term, I am skeptical of both the size and precision of this estimate.\" Though most of the experts we interviewed agreed that there would be some job growth, University of Chicago economist Casey B. Mulligan argues that increasing Medicaid will reduce employment because people will no longer need to work full-time to get health insurance. \"Medicaid makes it less painful to have a low income, so people have less incentive to take actions to prevent their incomes from getting low,\" he previously told PolitiFact. \"Not everyone acts that way, but enough do that a Medicaid expansion would depress employment nationally.\""

    "doc": "Grover Norquist, who heads the conservative, anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform, is no fan of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. In a tweet sent on Sept. 8, 2013, Norquist cites research by the Congressional Budget Office -- the independent budget-analysis arm of Congress -- to quantify how much money the federal government could save by delaying some of the health care law\u2019s key provisions. \"CBO reports that delaying the Obamacare individual mandate will reduce the deficit by $35 billion over 10 years. Another good reason,\" Norquist tweeted. Is Norquist right? The tweet refers to a CBO analysis released on Sept. 6, 2013. The agency looked at the potential impact on the federal budget if a bill that has already passed the House were to become law. The bill includes a one-year delay of the start of the requirement that individuals secure health insurance coverage, as well as a similar delay of the tax penalties assessed for not complying with that \"individual mandate.\" (The bill would also delay by a year the imposition of penalties on employers who do not offer health insurance, though the Obama administration has already implemented that change, so we will not focus on that provision in this article.) The measure passed the House on July 17 by a 264-161 vote, with a minority of Democrats -- 35 in all -- siding with all but one of the Republicans who voted to support the bill. It now awaits action in the Senate, though that is considered unlikely since the Senate is controlled by the Democrats. CBO determined that over 10 years -- its typical time frame from analyzing the fiscal impact of bills -- passing the measure would save $35.4 billion. Here\u2019s where the bulk of that money comes from (a small share comes from other areas): \u2022 Fewer uninsured Americans signing up for government health care programs such as Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, because the mandate wouldn\u2019t be pushing people to do so. Savings: $16.9 billion over 10 years. \u2022 Fewer uninsured Americans receiving federal subsidies designed to help them purchase plans on the law\u2019s insurance marketplace. Savings: $8.9 billion over 10 years. \u2022 More Americans receiving cash in their paychecks (which is taxable) rather than health insurance (which is not taxable), balanced by the absence of collections of tax penalties for non-compliance. Additional tax revenues, on balance: $7.4 billion over 10 years. So Norquist has cited the number accurately. However, it\u2019s worth noting a few other things CBO said that didn\u2019t make it into the tweet. First, this boon to the federal treasury comes at a cost. CBO said that passage of the law would increase the number of people without health insurance by about 11 million in 2014, compared to what CBO estimated Obama\u2019s law would accomplish if it remained intact. Second, Norquist correctly states that the $35 billion figure refers to cumulative savings over 10 years. However, it\u2019s worth noting that the bulk of that savings -- 58 percent -- comes in 2014, and 87 percent comes in either 2014 or 2015. In other words, the benefit to the federal treasury is mostly a one-time event; the bill wouldn't cancel a program permanently, only delay spending for a year. So, passing the bill would not produce an ongoing stream of revenue or savings to the Treasury, since many of the people who aren't compelled to buy insurance in 2014 (or taxed for not buying it) will be shelling out for either an insurance plan or a tax penalty once the delayed requirements take effect."

According to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute's Urban Mobility Scorecard, which was cited in the article, the peak congestion cost for Texans in 2014 came out to $17.67 per hour for personal travel. Using this number, we can calculate the yearly delay (61 hours) multiplied by the excess fuel consumption rate (29 gallons at $3.12 per gallon) to get a total congestion cost of $1,490 per commuter. Additionally, City Observatory's Joe Cortright has criticized the Urban Mobility Scorecard for overestimating congestion costs and roadway expansion benefits, but the article notes that the scorecard focused on \"numbers that seem relevant,\" and that most people are concerned with what their daily commute costs them.\nFurthermore, the article cites Todd Litman with the Victoria Transport Policy Institute, who criticizes the Urban Mobility Report for overestimating congestion costs and roadway expansion benefits, but the article notes that Litman's criticism does not affect the group's method of gathering data.\nBased on these sources, it is reasonable to conclude that road congestion in Austin and Dallas does indeed cost drivers more than $1,000 per year.",
    "doc": "Two weeks before the Nov. 3, 2015, election, Gov. Greg Abbott penned an op-ed that ran in the Dallas Morning News on Oct. 16, 2015, and again in the Austin American- Statesman three days later, urging voters to support a state constitutional proposition to funnel more dollars to funding Texas roads. He made the case by citing what daily traffic congestion costs Texas motorists in dollars, over the course of a year. \"Road congestion costs rush-hour drivers in Austin and Dallas more than $1,000 a year,\" Abbott said. \"And in Houston, it\u2019s even more -- almost $1,500 a year.\" Traffic in the state\u2019s major cities can be awful. Does it really cost Texans up to an extra $1,500 a year? Replying to our inquiry, Abbott spokesman John Wittman said the governor drew on research in the 2015 Urban Mobility Scorecard issued August 2015 by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute. The institute has been compiling this data since 1984. In fact, the institute was subject to a 2012 PolitiFact Georgia fact-check questioning the costs Atlanta residents bear to get around town. That claim was ruled Mostly True. For our part, we reached out to Tim Lomax, a senior research engineer at the Texas Transportation Institute, to get a better handle on the math. The group calculates the cost of traffic congestion using four sets of numbers: - the travel delay (amount of extra time a trip takes compared to \"free-flowing conditions\") during commuting times (6-10 a.m. and 3-7 p.m. Monday-Friday) divided by the commuter population, using figures from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. - the travel delay during off-peak non-commuting times (all other times) divided by the total number of people in the urban area. - excess fuel consumption from being stuck in traffic calculated using the state average cost per gallon for gasoline during peak commuting times. - excessfuel consumption during off-peak non-commuting times. And, according to the institute, the peak congestion cost for Texans in 2014 came out to $17.67 per hour for personal travel. In Houston, the number-crunchers found a 61-hour average yearly delay per commuter and an excess fuel consumption of 29 gallons at $3.12 (average price for a gallon of gasoline in Texas in 2014) for a total congestion cost of $1,490 per commuter, according to the scorecard. When we took a look, however, the math worked out differently. We multiplied the yearly delay (61 hours) by $17.67, and added that to the excess fuel consumption rate (29 gallons at $3.12 per gallon) and got a lower annual average cost of $1168. Our calculations for Austin and Dallas also came up short ($987.48 instead of TTI\u2019s $1159; Dallas came out to $1005.15 compared to the scorecard\u2019s $1185; we found San Antonio to have a cost of $839.88, instead of $1,002). We went back to Lomax to explain the math discrepancy. He said the total congestion cost Abbott and others cite ($1,490 per year per commuter for Houston) includes both peak travel and off-peak travel times; the tables in the scorecard only show figures for peak travel times. Lomax said the scorecard focused on \"numbers that seem relevant,\" and that most people are concerned with what their daily commute costs them. However, he also said that total congestion cost is important to use because it calculates for all times of the day. Critics question calculations Joe Cortright, an urban economist at City Observatory, has been critical of the Urban Mobility Scorecard for years, and often is cited by other urban transportation organizations, as well as in the 2012 PolitiFact Georgia fact-check. We spoke with him over the phone to better understand his qualms. For him, the congestion cost figure is overblown and used mainly to justify the need for more roads by transportation departments. City Observatory is a Knight Foundation-funded think tank focused on debunking \"misconceptions\" in urban research and city planning. The Transportation Institute\u2019s travel delay compares the extra time it takes to get to your destination due to congestion, compared to how long it would take in free-flow conditions. Cortright argues it\u2019s unreasonable to expect there to be zero congestion on roads during peak times, and impossible to increase the supply of roads to the extent that there would be no travel delays. Also, he says if roads are increased to handle that demand, more people could end up on the roads creating congestion after all. If you can\u2019t drive faster than the speed limit, that represents a cost to you, he said. \"I\u2019m not sure anybody, as a matter of public policy, would argue that makes sense.\" Another component of the total congestion cost is excess fuel consumption. Lomax said the institute uses the state average fuel price for each year. While fuel costs have declined steadily since August 2014, that won\u2019t be reflected until next year\u2019s scorecard. Lomax added that fuel prices account for less than 10 percent of the total congestion cost, and most of that congestion cost is travel time. The Transportation Institute partnered with Inrix, a Seattle-based traffic data provider for this year\u2019s scorecard. Inrix had its own travel time index, which didn\u2019t account for traffic volumes on different roads. The Inrix method would give \"every piece of road the same weight,\" Lomax said in an email, so a portion of the West Loop in Houston would be considered equal to a more sparsely traveled road. The Institute\u2019s method gives more weight to heavily traveled areas such as the 610 Loop because \"it carries a lot more people.\" \"Our swings, whether up or down, were not nearly as big as their changes,\" Lomax said. Cortright with City Observatory also criticizes the Transportation Institute\u2019s lack of peer review in its research. Asked about how the group gathers its data and why a peer review doesn\u2019t occur, Lomax said TTI has a timely topic with a limited shelf life, and does not \"wait around six months\" for other people to look at the data. Todd Litman with the Victoria Transport Policy Institute, a Canadian independent research organization based in Victoria, British Columbia, criticizes the Urban Mobility Report for \"overestimating congestion costs and roadway expansion benefits\" and for not incorporating research methods, such as a dedicated literature review. PolitiFact Georgia\u2019s claim from TTI on congestion costs for Atlanta residents cited a University of Connecticut civil and environmental engineering professor Norman Garrick, who said the report doesn\u2019t take other factors such as health care and the environment into account. Research sponsors of the Texas Transportation Institute include the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, Texas Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Transportation, often the same organizations that cite the institute\u2019s research as proof of a need for more funding for new roadways. Asked how this could affect the work done, Lomax said it\u2019s not a factor. While TTI has several sponsors, he said the mobility scorecard only has two sponsors: the institute and Inrix. At any given time, anywhere from 250 to 300 projects could be going on at once at TTI, he said."

    "doc": "With the recent legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado, pot is hot. So when a reader was curious about the accuracy of an Internet meme about hemp -- a close botanical cousin of marijuana that has been caught up on in the war on drugs -- they sent it our way. The graphic says: \"In 1916, the U.S. government predicted that by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down.\" The claim has proliferated all over the Internet. Sometimes a source is listed (such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture archives), but none of the repetitions ever seems to have a checkable citation, much less a direct link to a verifiable source. We decided to take a closer look. First, some background on hemp. Hemp and marijuana are both varieties of the cannabis plant, but hemp has much lower levels of THC, the psychoactive compound that makes marijuana a drug. Over the years, hemp has been used to make a wide variety of products, from rope, fabrics and paper to food and fuel, but its use in the United States dwindled after World War II. After more than a decade of dormancy as a crop in the United States, hemp was effectively outlawed by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which drew no distinctions between hemp and cannabis, presumably because the two plants look so similar that it would be easy to conceal illegal marijuana plants in a field of hemp. Some states have since loosened their laws about hemp cultivation, but federal law remains a steep obstacle to efforts to revive the domestic hemp industry. Because the legal fates of marijuana and hemp have been closely intertwined over the years, supporters of decriminalizing marijuana have often made common cause with those who would like to revive hemp as a crop in the United States. That\u2019s why the Internet meme we are checking struck a chord among marijuana-legalization supporters on social media. Still, widely believed doesn\u2019t necessarily mean correct. Did the U.S. government really predict that hemp would, in the course of three decades, make wood obsolete as the raw material for making paper? The notion is not entirely implausible. The Agriculture Department does have \"a lot of pre-World War II material on hemp,\" said Wayne Olson, a librarian at the National Agricultural Library, which is part of the Agriculture Department. That\u2019s because hemp was once a cultivated crop in many states, especially Kentucky. The best known of these Agriculture Department documents is Bulletin 404, which features a pair of studies published in 1916 that investigate the plausibility of using hemp hurds -- a part of the hemp plant -- to make paper. This document has played a key role in the arguments of those who support legalizing hemp and marijuana, due partly to numerous citations in The Emperor Wears No Clothes, abook initially published in 1985 by the late Jack Herer, a pro-cannabis activist. Herer\u2019s volume has been widely read within the pro-cannabis community, though it\u2019s been questioned by historians for the quality of its scholarship. Even though Bulletin 404 was mentioned at several points in The Emperor Wears No Clothes, Herer\u2019s book never makes the claim circulating in the Internet meme we\u2019re checking. More to the point, when we looked at Bulletin 404 itself, we couldn\u2019t find any reference to a prediction that \"by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp.\" The papers that comprise Bulletin 404 are highly technical, dwelling on matters such as how much caustic soda was used in the tests and how to measure \"unsieved hurds.\" Truth be told, the authors\u2019 powers of prediction were rather faulty. They wrote that \"there appears to be little doubt that under the present system of forest use and consumption, the present supply can not withstand the demands placed upon it.\" As anyone who uses paper knows, that certainly didn\u2019t come to pass. Nor did the authors\u2019 prediction that, \"without doubt, hemp will continue to be one of the staple agricultural crops of the United States.\" And even that is not the same thing as predicting that all paper will eventually come from hemp. So Bulletin 404 is a dead end. What about other papers? Tom Murphy, the National Outreach Coordinator with the group Vote Hemp, pointed us to one additional document dating from around the same time -- a 72-page chapter from the Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture for 1913. But this document didn\u2019t make the claim we\u2019re checking, either. Olson of the National Agricultural Laboratory was skeptical that the claim actually exists somewhere in the department\u2019s archives. \"I have been here since 1987 and have a pretty good idea what\u2019s in the collection, but I have not heard that quote,\" he said. And Joseph Schwarz of the National Archives and Records Administration said that his office, at our request, searched the general correspondence on hemp for 1916 and 1917 as well as the Online Public Access Catalog. Such a claim could not be located, he said. Academics expressed skepticism that the claim was made. \"I never encountered this statement,\" said Michael Schaller, a University of Arizona historian. \"At various times there have been many claims about hemp, so it is possible someone, somewhere, sometime, said it. But I have not seen it in any original source.\" Ralph Weisheit, a professor of criminal justice sciences at Illinois State University and author of Domestic Marijuana: A Neglected Industry, agreed that \"it doesn't sound right. This was a time in our nation's history when trees were abundant, and I'd be surprised if a government agency was completely ruling them out as a source for paper.\" Ten other experts told PolitiFact that they had never heard of this claim, had never seen it persuasively documented, or both. \"I have read Bulletin 404 carefully and can see no such claim,\" said Samuel Thayer, an expert in edible wild plants, author of The Forager\u2019s Harvest, and creator of the Hemphoax.org website, which casts doubt on a wide variety of claims by hemp advocates. \"It is possible the source is something else, but since I have not seen the claim referenced to any document in particular, and I know of no other USDA document regarding hemp from that year, that is my working hypothesis about where it came from.\""

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it can be concluded that President Barack Obama's position on normalizing relations with Cuba has not changed since his 2008 campaign. The article provides several quotes and statements made by Obama during his 2008 campaign and after taking office, which consistently indicate that he requires certain steps to be taken by the Cuban government before normalization can occur. These steps include the liberation of all political prisoners and some basic steps toward freedom, including freedom of the press, political parties, labor unions, etc.\n\nThe article highlights several instances where Obama reiterated his campaign position during his 2008 presidential race, including a speech he gave in Miami in May 2008, where he emphasized the importance of \"libertad\" (Spanish for freedom) and called for a new strategy on Cuba. He also stated that he would maintain the embargo as leverage to present the regime with a clear choice: if they take significant steps toward democracy, beginning with the freeing of all political prisoners, the United States will take steps to begin normalizing relations.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article does not suggest that Obama's position on normalizing relations with Cuba has changed since his 2008 campaign. On the contrary, it appears that he has remained consistent in his requirements for normalization, focusing on the need for democratic reforms and the release of political prisoners in Cuba. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "President Barack Obama\u2019s announcement that the United States and Cuba would proceed toward normalized relations put Miami\u2019s Cuban-American GOP Congressional delegation in the national spotlight. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Reps Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen held a press conference Dec. 18 to bash Obama\u2019s announcement. Diaz-Balart characterized Obama\u2019s position as a significant change from what he said during the 2008 campaign. Back in 2008, during Obama\u2019s first White House bid, the future president said that \"before normalization would take place, there would have to be liberation of all political prisoners and some basic steps toward freedom, including freedom of the press, political parties, labor unions, etc.,\" Diaz-Balart said at the press conference. \"Then, once again, President Obama -- breaking his own word, breaking his own pledge -- has decided to do something absolutely without precedent, and that is to give an anti-American terrorist dictatorship exactly what they have been asking for.\" Is Diaz-Balart correct about what Obama, then a senator, said would be his criteria for normalizing relations with Cuba? We went back to his campaign speeches and statements to find out. Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign position on Cuba Obama\u2019s historic announcement to normalize relations with Cuba was announced jointly by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. Plans call for opening embassies in Havana and Washington, easing travel restrictions and increasing the amount of money that Cubans on the island can receive from relatives in the United States. and other Americans. Those traveling to Cuba from the United States will also be able use credit cards on the island, and Cuba may be removed from the State Department\u2019s list as a state sponsor of terrorism. However, the longstanding trade embargo \u2013 strengthened in 1996 with passage of the Helms-Burton Act -- remains in place. Only Congress has the power to abolish it. Under Helms-Burton, the embargo can only be lifted when Cuba holds free and fair elections, releases political prisoners and guarantees free speech and workers' rights. While Obama promised that the United States will continue its efforts to spread democracy to Cuba, we don\u2019t see anything in what\u2019s been released that would require Cuba to promote democracy or establish freedom of the press, political parties and unions in order to normalize relations. Under the agreement, Cuba released 53 political prisoners, pledged to loosen Internet controls and agreed to permit enhanced access for the International Red Cross. Cuba also released USAID worker Alan Gross and an unidentified spy who had been imprisoned in Cuba for the last 20 years. The United States released three imprisoned Cuban spies in Florida. Gross was a subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development who\u2019d been held since his arrest on Dec. 3, 2009. Cuban authorities charged him with smuggling satellite communications equipment to the country as part of the USAID\u2019s pro-democracy programs. Media outlets have identified the spy as 51-year-old Rolando Sarraff, a former Cuban intelligence agent arrested by the Castro government in November 1995. During the 2008 campaign, Obama sometimes talked about his criteria for normalizing relations with Cuba and lifting the embargo in the same breath, making it appear that his criteria overlapped. During the Democratic presidential primary in 2007, Obama wrote an op-ed for the Miami Herald in which he called for \"unrestricted rights'' for Cuban-American travel and remittances to the island. \"Accordingly, I will use aggressive and principled diplomacy to send an important message: If a post-Fidel (Castro) government begins opening Cuba to democratic change, the United States (the president working with Congress) is prepared to take steps to normalize relations and ease the embargo that has governed relations between our countries for the last five decades,\" Obama wrote. When Fidel Castro -- the island nation\u2019s longtime dictator -- resigned in February 2008, Obama said, \"If the Cuban leadership begins opening Cuba to meaningful democratic change, the United States must be prepared to begin taking steps to normalize relations and to ease the embargo of the last five decades.'' (When he stepped down, Fidel Castro turned over power to his younger brother, Raul.) A spokeswoman for Diaz-Balart also pointed to a speech Obama gave in Miami in May 2008. \"My policy toward Cuba will be guided by one word: 'libertad,' \" he said, citing the Spanish word for \"freedom.\" \"The road to freedom for all Cubans must begin with justice for Cuba's political prisoners, the right of free speech, a free press, freedom of assembly, and it must lead to elections that are free and fair. That is my commitment.\" Obama called for a new strategy on Cuba, and held out the possibility of a meeting with Castro \"at a time and place of my choosing, but only when we have an opportunity to advance the interests of the United States, and to advance the cause of freedom for the Cuban people.\" Then Obama turned to the embargo: \"I will maintain the embargo. It provides us with the leverage to present the regime with a clear choice: If you take significant steps toward democracy, beginning with the freeing of all political prisoners, we will take steps to begin normalizing relations.\" We sent Diaz-Balart\u2019s statement to a spokesman for Obama. \"I think its fair to report that there was significant progress here (regarding) the political prisoners \u2013 they released a large (number of prisoners) that we specifically requested,\" Eric Schultz said. \"The president has always been flexible on specifics (regarding) negotiations and clear there would be some give and take.\" Schultz pointed to various statements by Obama in which he addressed normalizing relations with Cuba, including an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on May 20, 2008. Blitzer asked Obama about charges leveled against him by his Republican opponent, Arizona Sen. John McCain. McCain had said that Obama wanted to sit down unconditionally for a presidential meeting with Raul Castro. Blitzer asked Obama, \"Are you ready to normalize relations with Raul Castro\u2019s regime?\" Obama replied: \"No. ... I have never said that I was prepared to immediately normalize relations with Cuba.\" Obama added, \"If we could see progress on a whole host of issues, then we should move in the direction of normalization, because what we have done over the last 50 years obviously not has worked for what is the primary criteria of U.S.-Cuban policy, which is making sure that the Cuban people have freedom.\" As for meeting with Castro, Obama said that \"what I have said is I would be willing to meet without preconditions, but with a lot of preparation. And this is the same argument that we've been having with respect to Iran.\" Obama on embargo in 2004 Just a footnote that\u2019s beyond the scope of Diaz-Balart\u2019s claim: Obama articulated a more conciliatory position on Cuba when he ran for U.S. Senate in 2004 then he did four years later when he sought the White House. \"I think it\u2019s time for us to end the embargo in Cuba,\" Obama said on Jan. 20, 2004, in a speech at Southern Illinois University. \"And the Cuban embargo has failed to provide the source of raising standards of living and it has squeezed the innocents in Cuba.\" The embargo, he said, has \"utterly failed in the effort to overthrow Castro, who\u2019s now have been there since I was born. So, it\u2019s time for us to acknowledge that that particular policy has failed.\""

The post from Nov. 15, 2019, claimed that Sambucol, an elderberry extract, and Oscillococcinum, a diluted duck heart and liver pill, offer flu relief. \"A nurse friend taught me this,\" the post says. \"If you have the Flu\u2026 get these two items\u2026 Sambucol [and] Oscillococcinum\u2026 in 48 hours you will feel better. In 72 hours you will be almost symptom-free.\" The medical community is still debating how effective these supplements are, with a few small studies showing positive results. While doctors agree that Sambucol has the most flu-fighting potential, there is little evidence that Oscillococcinum can considerably shorten the length of the flu. Both Sambucol and Oscillococcinum\u2019s websites note that their claims to treat influenza symptoms \"have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.\" The Mayo Clinic recommends using an antiviral drug like Tamiflu if you \"have severe infection or are at higher risk for complications.\" Effectiveness of Sambucol Sambucol is an elderberry extract that originates in folk medicine, where elderberries were used to treat various illnesses, including sinus congestion, sore throat, common cold and rheumatism. Elderberries contain tannins and viburnic acid, which have been shown to help with nasal congestion and to improve respiration. They also have one of the three highest anti-inflammatory capacities ever seen in fruit or berries, according to a study from the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry. A study in 2001 found that Sambucol has antiviral properties and was connected to an increase in the inflammatory cytokines found in patients\u2019 blood, effectively activating the immune systems of influenza patients. A small 2004 study of the healing properties of Sambucol in Norway found that otherwise-healthy flu patients treated with the elderberry extract had symptom relief on average four days earlier than the placebo group. Patients treated with Sambucol had no symptoms after 48 to 72 hours. The study found that Sambucol \"seems to offer an efficient, safe and cost-effective treatment for influenza.\" The study included only 80 influenza patients, and the administrators called for a larger study of elderberry extracts to verify their findings. Effectiveness of Oscillococcinum Oscillococcinum is made from highly diluted heart and liver of wild duck, but essentially no molecules of duck heart or liver are found in the actual pill, according to Pharmacy Times. Cochrane, an independent health care research center, did a review of Oscillococcinum trials in 2015. Cochrane found that Oscillococcinum did not prevent the flu in preventative trials, and that the trials that \"proved\" the supplement helped with flu symptoms were biased because they were performed by employees at Boiron, the company that produces Oscillococcinum. A study in Italy in 2018 did use Oscillococcinum to treat patients with respiratory tract infections and found that patients taking the supplement had fewer RTI episodes than patients without treatment. Their study spanned an eight-year period with 455 patients and found that it had the potential to save health center funds, with \"significantly lower costs in the patient population being treated.\""

    "doc": "By now, there are very few Americans who haven\u2019t heard of the \"ALS Ice Bucket Challenge\" -- the social media-driven campaign during the summer of 2014 to dump ice water on your head as a way of raising awareness of the neuromuscular disease ALS and promoting donations to the ALS Association, which funds medical research and support programs for those who have the disease. The effort has led to at least $94 million in donations to the ALS Association -- a jolt of extra funding for a group that last year spent a comparatively modest $26 million. But not everyone is happy about this development. A blog called politicalears.com posted an article stating that the Ice Bucket Challenge was a \"fraud\" because most of the money was being spent on administration and overhead. The unsigned post was picked up widely on social media feeds; that\u2019s where PolitiFact readers noticed it. Several of them asked us to check it out, so we did. (The website has no contact information, so we were unable to reach the person who wrote the post.) Here are key excerpts from the Aug. 28 blog post, headlined, \"Ice bucket fraud: ALS Foundation admits that 73% of donations are not used for ALS research.\" \"We've been duped. America is filled with fun-loving and caring people. The viral ice bucket challenge has combined both our sense of responsibility to our fellow human with fun. And it has been fun! Who didn't love seeing Sarah Palin doused? \"But wait? Ice Bucket Challenge donations are nearing $100 MILLION. Where is that money going? According to the ALS Foundation, not towards ALS. \"Over 73% of all donations raised are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations. Less than 27% is actually used for the purpose we donated for. \"According to the ECFA, a charitable watchdog, 27% of donations actually making it to the cause they are donated to is unacceptable. In fact, the ECFA won't deem a non-profit as a reliable charity unless at least 80% of donations make it to their intended projects. ... \"The ALS Foundation is a terrible organization to send your money. If you decide to take the Ice Bucket Challenge, may I humbly suggest that you select a well-researched charity (on your own, no endorsements here) and send it to them.\" The post reprints a pie chart taken directly from the ALS Association\u2019s website, showing the following breakdown of expenses: Research: $7.2 million (27 percent) Patient and community services: $5.1 million (19 percent) Public and professional education: $8.5 million (32 percent) Fundraising: $3.6 million (14 percent) Administration: $1.9 million (7 percent) Let\u2019s start by noting some comparatively minor problems. First, the group in question is the ALS Association, not the \"ALS Foundation,\" as the blog post calls it. Second, the ALS Association hasn\u2019t said anything to \"admit\" the claims asserted in the blog post, as the post\u2019s headline says. In fact, they\u2019ve posted a response to it here. Now for the blog post\u2019s biggest mistakes: \u2022 \"Over 73% of all donations raised are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations.\" Not true. The 73 percent figure appears to come from subtracting everything except for the 27 percent that falls under \"research.\" The charitable way (no pun intended) of viewing the post\u2019s error is that it misread the category headings. If the post had simply said \"research accounts for only 27 percent of the ALS Association\u2019s budget,\" that would be technically correct though still misleading, since the group\u2019s mission statement includes several goals beyond directly sponsoring research. They include raising awareness, serving as a trusted source of information, providing patients with access to support services and advocating for increased funding for research. Once you include \"patient and community services\" and \"public and professional education\" as legitimate spending to advance the group\u2019s stated mission, the percentage spent on items supporting those goals rises to nearly 79 percent. But the blog post actually exacerbated its error by specifically labeling 73 percent of the group\u2019s spending as \"fundraising, overhead, executive salaries and external donations.\" That\u2019s flat wrong. We\u2019ll add that if anyone wants to donate money to the association for research only, they can do that. \"If a donor would like 100% of their donation to go to research, he/she can simply check a box on our online donation form here,\" the association\u2019s website says. \"If a donor already donated and would like to redirect their donation, please email us at [emailprotected].\" \u2022 The role of ECFA. The post cites standards by ECFA, the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability, a group founded in 1979 that \"enhances trust in Christ-centered churches and ministries by establishing and applying Seven Standards of Responsible Stewardship to accredited organizations.\" However, when we contacted ECFA, Dan Busby, the group\u2019s president, told PolitiFact that his group does not advance the argument made in the post. \"We were very surprised to see the ALS-related report which attributes certain statements to ECFA,\" Dan Busby, the group\u2019s president, told PolitiFact. \"We did not provide any information for the story.\" Busby added that, contrary to what the blog post said, his group doesn\u2019t have a \"bright line\" test for a charity\u2019s appropriate spending percentage. \"The data of applicants and members which reflect high overhead expenses are carefully analyzed for propriety,\" he said. \"In addition to considering the financial picture of a potential donee charity, we believe donors should also look at other attributes, including the charity's commitment to effective board governance, financial integrity, and appropriate accountability.\" Other groups that analyze charities have given the ALS Association high scores. Charity Navigator, for instance, gave the ALS Association a score of four stars out of four for financial standards and transparency and accountability.

    "claim": "Says Obama called Medicaid \"broken\" four years ago.",
    "taxonomy_label": "interval",
    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it can be concluded that the claim \"Obama called Medicaid 'broken' four years ago\" is True. The evidence consists of two parts: a quote from President Obama's speech and a confirmation from Governor Perry's spokesperson.\n\nIn President Obama's speech, he stated, \"If we don't get control over costs, then it is going to be very difficult for us to expand coverage. These two things have to go hand in hand. Another way of putting it is we can't simply put more people into a broken system that doesn't work.\" This quote from the President clearly implies that he considers Medicaid to be broken.\n\nGovernor Perry's spokesperson, Josh Havens, confirmed that Governor Perry was referring to this same Obama speech when he made his statement. Additionally, Havens pointed out that President Obama had also mentioned Medicaid as a factor in his book \"The Audacity of Hope\" in 2006.\n\nBased on these two pieces of evidence, it can be concluded that President Obama did indeed refer to Medicaid as \"broken\" four years ago. Therefore, the label True is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "\"If you don\u2019t believe me that Medicaid is broken, just ask our president,\" Texas Gov. Rick Perry told the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 14, 2013. \"Four years ago, he said, and I quote, \u2018We can't simply put more people into a broken system that doesn't work,\u2019 end quote.\" In Perry\u2019s speech at the American Conservative Union\u2019s annual gathering of activists, he described Medicaid as \"on its way to bankruptcy\" and vowed he wouldn\u2019t join other Republican governors who had gotten on board with Obamacare\u2019s expansion of the state-federal program, which insures low-income Americans. But did President Barack Obama say it was \"broken\"? An Internet search will quickly enough direct the curious reader to Obama\u2019s remark, made June 2, 2009, at the White House before a health-care discussion with Senate Democrats. Between the quotation marks Perry indicated, he captured Obama\u2019s words; here we present them with more context: As we move forward on health care reform, it is not sufficient for us simply to add more people to Medicare or Medicaid to increase the rolls, to increase coverage in the absence of cost controls and reform. And let me repeat this principle: If we don't get control over costs, then it is going to be very difficult for us to expand coverage. These two things have to go hand in hand. Another way of putting it is we can't simply put more people into a broken system that doesn't work. So we've got to reform the underlying system. And this means promoting best practices, not just the most expensive practices. (Click here to read Obama\u2019s full speech, and here to watch Perry\u2019s speech.) Perry spokesman Josh Havens confirmed by email that the governor was referring to this Obama speech, and pointed out a precedent in Obama\u2019s 2006 book, \"The Audacity of Hope\": As initially passed in 2010, Obamacare would have required states to expand Medicaid by opening the program to all households with income below 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 which in 2013 is $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. A June 2012 Supreme Court decision gave states the choice to opt in or opt out of expanding their Medicaid rolls, which is the decision Texas currently faces. But much more was at stake in mid-2009. Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul would not pass the Senate until Dec. 24, 2009; the House passed it March 21, 2010. A CNN timeline shows Obama had told Congress in February 2009 that health care reform would not wait another year and held a White House summit on health care in March 2009. In June 2009, Obama launched what news stories in the Washington Post, New York Times and other papers described as a full-on push to get comprehensive health care legislation drafted and passed. The speech Perry quoted was one salvo. Obama hit the same notes in a letter sent to the Senate Democratic leaders after that meeting and in his June 5, 2009, weekly radio/Internet address. In each, Obama called the health-care system \"broken\" and specified that rising health care costs were the problem, citing Medicaid as a factor in the letter but not in the speech. Obama\u2019s letter said, \"Soaring health care costs make our current course unsustainable\" and \"the ever-increasing cost of Medicare and Medicaid are among the main drivers of enormous budget deficits.\" In the radio address, he did not name Medicaid or Medicare but said, \"We will seize this historic opportunity to finally fix what ails our broken health-care system\" by attacking \"the root causes of skyrocketing health care costs.\" White House spokeswoman Joanna Rosholm declined to comment on Perry\u2019s claim. We asked Havens for his thoughts on Obama\u2019s references to the health-care system (not just Medicaid) as broken. Havens replied by email: \"No matter how you want to look at it, the president specifically referred to Medicaid when he was talking about a broken system that doesn\u2019t work.\""

    "taxonomy_label": "temporal",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that Governor Rick Perry has yet to receive a response from President Barack Obama to his letter making border security requests is false. The evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim. In an interview with CNN on April 5, 2013, Perry stated that he handed Obama a letter on the tarmac at the Austin airport about the issue of immigration and border security, but did not receive a response. However, this statement is refuted by an August 27, 2010, letter from John O. Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, which was sent on White House letterhead. The letter acknowledges Perry's concerns and appreciates his outreach, but does not embrace any of Perry's requests. Instead, it notes that President Obama has made securing the border a priority and highlights the Southwest Border Security Act, which was signed into law shortly after Perry's visit to Austin. The letter also mentions additional National Guard troops and other security resources that would be deployed to enhance security on the southern border. Taken together, these pieces of evidence suggest that Governor Perry did receive a response from President Obama, albeit not one that fully addressed his requests.",
    "doc": "Gov. Rick Perry says his 2010 plea to President Barack Obama for border security help remains unanswered.Perry made the appeal to Obama in August 2010 when they met on the airport tarmac in Austin, where Obama was visiting for the day. The governor mentioned the airport meeting when he appeared on CNN\u2019s \"The Situation Room\" on April 5, 2013.Perry said \"the president hadn't called up the governor of one of the largest states who has the longest border with Mexico and said, \u2018Governor, what do you think we need to do about the issue of immigration?\u2019 I would be open to that conversation any day.\"CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer replied: \"So if he calls you, are you ready to go to the White House and sit down with the president and try to come up with some sensible solutions to comprehensive immigration reform?\"\"Absolutely,\" Perry said. \"As a matter of fact, I handed him a letter some two or three years ago on the tarmac at the Austin airport about that issue, about border security. And yet to get a response.\"At the Aug. 9, 2010, airport encounter, caught on TV cameras, Perry and Obama chatted for less than a minute, according to news stories. Perry ultimately handed his letter on border security to a White House aide, Valerie Jarrett.In the letter, Perry said he was renewing his invitation for the president and federal officials to meet with Texas officials on security issues. In addition, the letter urged federal drones to be flown along the border and mentioned Perry\u2019s unfulfilled \"standing request\" for 1,000 National Guard troops to work with Texas law enforcement on security operations. Noting the Obama administration\u2019s recently announced plans to send 1,200 National Guard troops to the border, Perry\u2019s letter said the \"deployment of just 286 National Guard personnel along the 1,200-mile Texas-Mexico border is clearly insufficient.\"We asked Perry\u2019s office about the governor not hearing back from Obama. By email, spokesman Josh Havens said: \"We are still waiting on a response from President Obama.\"Then again, Perry fielded a White House response at the time.Havens simultaneously emailed us a copy of an Aug. 27, 2010, letter to Perry signed by John O. Brennan, then assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism. In May 2013, Brennan was sworn in as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.Brennan\u2019s letter, on White House letterhead, opened: \"Thank you for your August 9, 2010, letter to President Obama regarding security concerns on our Southwest border. On behalf of President Obama, I wish to assure you that we understand your concerns and appreciate your outreach.\"Brennan\u2019s letter further said that securing the border had been an Obama priority. The letter did not embrace any of Perry\u2019s requests, but noted that a few days after his Austin stop, Obama signed the Southwest Border Security Act into law, enabling the \"addition of substantial and varied law enforcement resources to enhance security on our southern border.\" As an example, the letter said, additional National Guard troops and \"other security resources\" would serve. \"It is anticipated that Texas will have over 20 National Guardsmen serving as criminal investigative analysts in fusion centers and over 225 Guardsmen conducting ground surveillance,\" in National Entry Identification Teams the letter said.The letter closed: \"We are united in our common interest and focused efforts to secure the Southwest border. Your continued engagement and partnership on this national security imperative is much appreciated.\"We emailed the White House and Department of Homeland Security on this topic and did not hear back. We also asked Havens if the governor responded to Brennan\u2019s letter, and we filed an open-records\u2019 request asking the governor\u2019s office for border-related communications between the state and White House since Perry and Obama visited on the tarmac. No materials came our way in the first few days after we submitted the request."

    "claim": "Says President Dwight Eisenhower \"moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim that President Dwight Eisenhower \"moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country\" is Conflicting because the evidence provided challenges this claim. While it is true that Eisenhower oversaw a campaign in the 1950s known as \"Operation Wetback,\" which did result in the deportation of undocumented immigrants, the number of people deported is not as clear-cut as Trump suggests.\n\nFirstly, the estimate of 1.5 million deportations during Operation Wetback is based on a statement from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which has been disputed by historians. Don Mitchell, a geography professor at Syracuse University, notes that the INS claimed as many as 1.3 million people were deported, but the number officially apprehended did not come anywhere near this total. Similarly, Kelly Lytle Hernandez, a history professor at the University of California Los Angeles, puts the maximum number of people actually deported during the operation at 250,000.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that many of the deportees were able to re-enter the United States illegally or legally as guest workers. According to historian Mae M. Ngai, transportation conditions for the deportees were inhumane in some cases, leading to the deaths of 88 people in a July deportation round-up. However, attempts to relocate people to the Mexican interior did not always stop them from returning, with many returning illegally or legally as guest workers.\n\nFinally, the operation was more about policy changes that allowed more opportunities for immigrants to gain legal status through work visas than it was about deportation. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, notes that low levels of undocumented immigration in the 1950s were more likely a result of the guest worker program, rather than the 1954 deportation campaign.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that Trump's claim about Eisenhower deporting 1.5 million illegal immigrants is an exaggeration and a twist on the facts. While there were certainly deportations of undocumented immigrants during Operation Wetback, the actual number is much lower than what Trump suggests, and many of those deported were able to re-enter the United States illegally or legally as guest workers. Therefore, the label Conflicting is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "Real estate mogul Donald Trump reiterated his proposal to deport the country\u2019s illegal immigrants at the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Wis. History says his plan would work, Trump said. \"Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower, good president, great president, people liked him. \u2018I like Ike,\u2019 right?\" Trump said in the Nov. 10 debate hosted by Fox Business Network. \"Moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again beyond the border, they came back. Didn\u2019t like it. Moved them way south. They never came back.\" Eisenhower did oversee a 1950s campaign that deported undocumented immigrants. But did he really move that many in one operation? The dragnet Beginning in World War II -- during a severe shortage of workers on the home front -- the federal government instituted the Bracero program, which brought Mexican workers into the United States to fill jobs that would not otherwise be filled. The Braceros were in the country legally, but the government often looked the other way when companies illegally brought their own Mexican workers into the country. In 1954, workers brought in outside the Bracero program, combined with Mexicans who had crossed the border illegally on their own, were the targets of a program called -- and this is really what it was called -- \"Operation Wetback.\" The intention was to target illegal immigrants, though some U.S. citizens of Mexican ancestry were also caught up in the dragnet. Determining the number of people who were deported in \"Operation Wetback\" is tricky because some people who would have otherwise been subject to deportation were expected to leave the country \"voluntarily\" (or self-deportation). We came across estimates of forced removals ranging from 250,000 to 1.3 million. \"The (U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service) claimed as many as 1.3 million, though the number officially apprehended did not come anywhere near this total,\" according to the Texas State Historical Association\u2019s online handbook, produced in partnership with the University of Texas at Austin. The case of California is a good example. The INS (which was reorganized out of existencein 2003) said 540,000 people were to be deported from California alone during the campaign, said Don Mitchell, a geography professorat Syracuse University. But at least 485,000 would have had to deport themselves, and there\u2019s no evidence that they actually returned to Mexico in those numbers. Kelly Lytle Hernandez, a history professor at the University of California Los Angeles, puts the maximum number of people actually deported during the operation at 250,000. The vast majority of the program took place during fiscal year 1955, which registered just about 254,000 apprehensions total, she wrote in a 2010 report. Re-entry What about Trump\u2019s point that authorities deported people to more southern locations in Mexico to stop them from easily re-entering the United States? In earlier 20th century immigration control efforts, Border Patrol found that deporting immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border allowed them to easily cross back into the United States, according to Hernandez\u2019s paper. Starting in the 1940s, the United States would take deportees to the border, and from there Mexican authorities would take them to the country\u2019s interior either by train or boat, primarily. This continued during Operation Wetback, so Trump has a bit of a point there. It\u2019s worth noting that transportation conditions for the deportees bordered on inhumane in some cases. According to historian Mae M. Ngai, 88 people died in a July deportation round-up because of the heat. But attempts to relocate people to the Mexican interior did not always stop them from returning to the United States, Mitchell said. Many returned illegally or legally as guest workers. \"It is absolutely the case that sending folks to the interior did not stop them from returning,\" he said. \"It might be the case that some were discouraged, but others returned.\" Further, the operation was more about policy changes that actually allowed more opportunities for immigrants to gain legal status through work visas than it was about deportation, Hernandez told PolitiFact. The campaign would have been \"a complete failure\" had it not been for the guest worker program that accompanied it, wrote Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. Nowrasteh noted that low levels of undocumented immigration in the 1950s was more likely a result of the guest worker program, rather than the 1954 deportation campaign. The guest worker program ended in 1965. \"On the whole, though, Trump\u2019s comments are undoubtedly an exaggeration and a bit of a twist on the facts,\" Mitchell said."

    "claim": "Says Bill Nelson \"cast the deciding vote for Obamacare cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion and letting an unelected board decide what gets covered here.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim made by the American Crossroads ad attacking Bill Nelson is misleading. The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the ad misrepresents the facts regarding Nelson's vote on the Affordable Care Act and the impact of the law on Medicare spending.\n\nFirstly, the ad falsely claims that Nelson cast the deciding vote for Obamacare cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion and letting an unelected board decide what gets covered. However, as PolitiFact has repeatedly ruled, the healthcare law does not literally cut a dollar amount from the Medicare program's budget. Instead, it instituted changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the healthcare law reduced Medicare outlays by $716 billion over the 2013-2022 period, but this does not represent a cut in spending but rather an attempt to curtail future Medicare spending.\n\nSecondly, the ad claims that an unelected board will decide what gets covered here, implying that the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) will ration care and deny treatments to patients. However, as PolitiFact has explained, the IPAB is directed by law to identify Medicare savings, but it cannot submit recommendations to ration healthcare or raise revenue. The board only makes recommendations if Medicare exceeds its budget targets, and its decisions are subject to congressional override.\n\nIn conclusion, the American Crossroads ad misleads viewers by falsely claiming that Bill Nelson cast the deciding vote for Obamacare cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion and letting an unelected board decide what gets covered. The ad also distorts the fact that the healthcare law does not literally cut Medicare spending, but rather attempts to curtail future spending, and that the IPAB does not have the power to ration care or raise revenue. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "American Crossroads makes multiple claims about health care and Medicare in a recent ad attacking U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla.The ad shows a bleak photo of an empty examining table: \"This is where seniors could find out their Medicare benefits have been rationed or don\u2019t cover their treatments,\" states the narrator.Then the scene moves to a boardroom table: \"And this is where 15 unelected bureaucrats could decide to cut Medicare spending, cuts that could go into effect without Congressional approval. And this is where Sen. Nelson cast the deciding vote for Obamacare cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion and letting an unelected board decide what gets covered here,\" showing pictures of the U.S. Capitol and a hospital hallway.The claims by the conservative PAC are similar to other claims we\u2019ve fact-checked, but the wording is slightly different. We will evaluate whether Nelson cast the deciding vote for Obamacare cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion and letting an unelected board make coverage decisions. (We contacted American Crossroads for their evidence, but we didn't hear back.)Deciding vote?Accusing Nelson of casting \"the deciding vote\" on the health care law has become a conservative talking point as he faces U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers. Ads from outside spending groups such as American Commitment, the 60 Plus Association and Mack himself have all made similar claims.As we explained in an earlier fact-check, the health care law was passed with several very close votes. One of the key votes happened on Dec. 24, 2009, when 59 Democrats and one independent voted together in favor of the bill. (Sixty votes were needed for a preliminary cloture vote to prevent filibusters.) The ad cites a vote on Dec. 23 on a cloture motion which passed 60-39 with Nelson voting in the majority to move the bill forward.Opponents of the law have argued that any of those 60 cast the deciding vote, because every vote was needed to pass the bill.We find that argument unpersuasive (see our previous report), because there\u2019s evidence in the record to show that some of those votes were more critical than others. On the health care law, some senators did hold out until the last minute -- but Nelson -- as in Bill Nelson of Florida -- wasn\u2019t one of them.The Los Angeles Times, which wrote extensively about the negotiations in passing the law, reported that some of the most crucial votes came from Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.; Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb.; and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis.Nelson was initially quiet about health care reform, angering some Democratic activists. But in October 2009, Nelson joined other Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee in voting for the health care plan. Nelson wasn\u2019t a leading early activist of the bill, but he wasn\u2019t a last minute supporter, either. This part of the ad claiming that Nelson cast \"the deciding vote\" is wrong.Does the health care law cut Medicare spending by $700 billion?We\u2019ve seen a long list of claims about the health care law and a $700 billion Medicare cut. How accurate the claims are depend on the wording.As we explained in our previous fact-checks, neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut a dollar amount from the Medicare program\u2019s budget.Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. In its most recent estimates, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law reduced Medicare outlays by $716 billion.The reductions include the amount of annual increases health care providers would receive from Medicare, administrative changes and alterations to Medicare Advantage.PolitiFact has repeatedly ruled that these don\u2019t represent cuts, but rather an attempt to curtail future Medicare spending. The program is still projected to grow, the Congressional Budget Office predicts, just at a slower rate under the so-called Obamacare guidelines.An unelected boardThe ad also says that the health care law is \"letting an unelected board decide what gets covered here\" and says Medicare patients could find out their benefits have been \"rationed.\" We\u2019ve checked a whole slew of claims about the health care law and the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB. (The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation has a good primer about the board and a longer paper.)In many cases, political ads have falsely claimed that the board will ration care and deny treatments to patients.We have previously explained that the health care law directs the new board \u2014 with 15 members who are political appointees \u2014 to identify Medicare savings. It's forbidden from submitting \"any recommendation to ration health care,\" as Section 3403 of the health care law states. It may not raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB also cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue. Finally, the board only makes recommendations if Medicare is exceeding its budget targets.What it can do is reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some may argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives, this could lead to reductions in services.But the board wouldn't make any health care decisions for individual Americans. Instead, it would make broad policy decisions that affect Medicare's overall cost.The does mean the board decides what gets covered, at least in some cases. We should note, though, that Congress can override the board\u2019s decisions if it makes up the cuts some other way."

    "justification": "Based solely on the evidence provided in the article, it is appropriate to label Ben Carson's tax plan as \"False\". The article provides several reasons why Carson's tax plan would not generate enough revenue to cover government spending:\n\n1. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the United States is expected to collect $3.2 trillion in revenue in 2015, while government spending will reach $3.7 trillion. Carson's plan falls $0.6 trillion short of anticipated revenue and $1.1 trillion short of spending.\n2. The article notes that Carson's tax rate of 15% would generate about $2.6 trillion in revenue, which is still $0.6 trillion short of the expected revenue.\n3. Carson has proposed eliminating both the payroll tax ($1.1 trillion in 2015) and the estate tax ($20 billion), which alone puts him in a hole of $1.3 trillion.\n4. Even if we assume that Carson can tax all of GDP, his 15% tax rate still falls short of anticipated revenue and spending. As the article states, \"taxing all of GDP by 15 percent would still create a $1 trillion hole this year.\"\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that Carson's tax plan would not generate enough revenue to cover government spending, making his claim that his tax plan wouldn't leave the federal government with a $1.1 trillion hole \"False\".",
    "doc": "Ben Carson\u2019s tithe-based tax plan became the subject of a computational tussle between him and a CNBC moderator during the third GOP debate. Carson, a Seventh-day Adventist, has advocated for the federal government to adopt a tithing system across the board, referring to the Judeo-Christian practice of giving one-tenth of one\u2019s income to the Church. \"I think God is a pretty fair guy,\" he reasoned in the first Republican debate. Moderator Becky Quick pointed out that a 10 percent flat tax would bring in a lot less revenue and asked how would that work. Tithing was just an analogy and the rate would actually be closer to 15 percent, Carson responded, adding that he\u2019d fill the gap through \"strategic cutting.\" But Quick continued to press him on the numbers. Here\u2019s a snippet of their exchange on Oct. 28: Quick: \"You would have to cut government by about 40 percent to make it work with a $1.1 trillion hole.\" Carson: \"It's not true.\" Quick: \"It is true. I looked at the numbers.\" Carson: \"When we put all the facts down, you will be able to see that it's not true. It works out very well.\" So true or not true? Carson has yet to release a tax plan, and his spokesman Doug Watts said that Quick \"got several assumptions wrong\" though he didn\u2019t respond when we asked him which ones. But based on what Carson hassaid so far, Quick\u2019s math is sound. The plan Carson\u2019s campaign website calls for wholesale tax reform and \"to end the IRS as we know it,\" but includes almost no specifics. That makes theQuickand Carsonargument \"really quite pointless\" since there aren\u2019t enough details to properly model, said Scott Hodge of the Tax Foundation, an organization that analyzes tax plans and tends to take afree-market, low-tax approach. \"When Dr. Carson releases enough detail of his plan we will model it as well on an apples-to-apples basis as the other plans,\" Hodge said. Carson\u2019s formal tax plan will be released sometime within the next 30 days, Watts toldus. Until then, we\u2019ll assess what he has proposed so far, according to analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation, as well as our own research. It includes: \u2022 A flat income tax rate of 10 to 15 percent, phased in over time, with no deductions or loopholes; \u2022 A six-month tax hiatus for corporate profits overseas, but 10 percent has to be used in enterprise zones; \u2022 A corporate tax rate of 15 to 20 percent; \u2022 Eliminate the payroll tax, estate tax and the Affordable Care Act. Quick\u2019s math Under the current tax system, the United States is expected to collect $3.2 trillion in revenue in 2015, while government spending will reach $3.7 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Quick likely got her numbers by applying Carson\u2019s 15 percent tax rate to the total personal income and the total corporate income ($15.4 trillion and $2.1 trillion respectively, by the latest Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates for 2015). That would generate about $2.6 trillion in revenue. So Carson\u2019s plan falls $0.6 trillion short of anticipated revenue, and $1.1 trillion short of spending. To break even, you\u2019d have to reduce spending by about 30 percent annually, not as Quick said, 40 percent. We should note that this line of computation assumes that Carson would get rid of all other sources of revenue. Though he hasn\u2019t offered specifics on excise taxes, customs duties, etc., he has proposed to eliminate both the payroll tax (projected to generate $1.1 trillion in 2015) and the estate tax ($20 billion), which alone put him in the hole. Carson\u2019s math After objecting to Quick\u2019s calculations, Carson himself crunched the numbers a different way during the CNBC debate: \"If you talk about an $18 trillion economy, you are talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product, you are talking about $2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion. But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly. So that's not, by any stretch, pie in the sky.\" Experts, however, had a few bones to pick with Carson\u2019s math, starting with its premise. First, not all of GDP is taxable, pointed out Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center. To apply his rate to all $18 trillion, Carson would have to tax health insurance premiums, pensions and government spending (the $3.7 trillion that Carson wants to cut) to name a few. Second, even if we assume that you can tax all of GDP, the 15 percent tax rate still falls short of anticipated revenue and spending, as Carson acknowledges himself. Contrary to what he said, however, you can\u2019t \"make that amount up\" by applying the rate to corporate taxes and capital gains. That would be double-counting, since those are already a part of the total GDP figure, a post-debate CNBC article pointed out. In short, taxing all of GDP by 15 percent would still create a $1 trillion hole this year. \"(That\u2019s) the biggest piece of the biggest pie that we can come up with, and you\u2019d still be short 20 percent of revenue. Good luck with that,\" Williams said."

The evidence provided in the article supports this claim.\n\nFirstly, the article states that the first news organization to run the story was Fox News, who carried an item at 6 p.m. on the day the story broke. This indicates that Fox News was the first to report on the arrest, and therefore broke the story.\n\nSecondly, the article explains that the local Portland Fox affiliate, WPXT, was responsible for uncovering the story. A reporter at the station, Erin Fehlau, found the case number and began following the paper trail, which led to the Bush campaign confirming the arrest. However, the article notes that Fox News did not have a hand in doing the digging that brought this story to light, as WPXT was an independent news operation at the time.\n\nFinally, the article highlights the recognition Fehlau received for her work on the story, including the National Clarion Award and the regional Edward R.

This suggests that the story was widely reported and recognized as a significant news event, further supporting the claim that Fox News broke it.\n\nBased on these points, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim, as there is evidence to support both the claim that Fox News broke the story and the claim that other sources may have also reported on the arrest.",
    "doc": "In the world of cable television news, most people generally agree that Fox News caters to a more conservative audience and MSNBC a more liberal one. But conservative pundit Ann Coulter cautioned against seeing the news each network produces the same way. In a recent interview with Piers Morgan on CNN, Coulter used the coverage of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and an old story about President George W. Bush to draw a distinction between the two cable networks. \"I don't have a job so all I do is watch TV,\" Coulter said. \"If you watch no station but MSNBC, you have no idea what they're talking about on Fox. On Fox, I promise you, they're reporting the Chris Christie scandal -- maybe not 24 hours a day like the 9/11 attack.\" Coulter then pivoted to talking about the run-up to the 2000 presidential election and how reporters found out that Bush had a drunk driving arrest on his record. \"That story hurt George Bush in the 2000 presidential election,\" Coulter said. \"Who broke it? Fox News.\" Is Coulter rewriting history or does she have her facts right? We thought we\u2019d check. Bad news at a critical moment Headed into the final week before Election Day, Nov. 7, 2000, polls showed a razor-close contest between Bush and Democratic nominee Vice President Al Gore. With the disputed results in Florida, we know now how accurate those polls were. Just five days before the election, the country learned that in 1976 police in Maine had arrested Bush for drunk driving. His past troubles with drinking were already on the record but until Nov. 2, an arrest was not part of the narrative. The first news organization that ran the story was Fox News. It carried an item at 6 p.m. that day. Once Fox News ran it, the Associated Press spread the story to all the broadcasters and newspapers that subscribe to its service. To Coulter\u2019s point, the broader public first learned about Bush\u2019s arrest through Fox News. Uncovering a story vs. reporting it In the news business, breaking a story has a particular meaning. A reporter breaks a story by being the one who found it first. In the competitive world of journalism, these morsels are precious and newsrooms generally hold their cards close to the chest until they are ready to spring their scoop on the world. The release of the Bush arrest followed a different path. Fox News took this story from a local affiliate. Erin Fehlau, a reporter with the Portland Fox affiliate WPXT, first got wind of the arrest on the afternoon of Nov. 2. While working on another assignment, a police officer mentioned overhearing a conversation about Bush and drunk driving. Fehlau quickly found the case number and began following the paper trail. Back at the station, Fehlau\u2019s news director, who was relatively new, didn\u2019t know if this was old news. Later that afternoon, he called Fox News in New York City to find out. Fox News contacted the Bush campaign where a staffer confirmed that Bush had been arrested. Assistant news director Matt Ledin remembers what happened next. \"I was sitting in my office and I saw Fox reporting our story.\" Ledin told PunditFact. \"I think they credited us, but I was surprised.\" That was at 6 p.m. At 7 p.m., WPXT had the story in its newscast. At 10 p.m., Fehlau broadcast her report with all the details. Fox News had no hand in doing the digging that brought this story to light. WPXT was an independent news operation in 2000, owned by Pegasus Communications, a Pennsylvania corporation that paid for the rights to run Fox programs. Fehlau was generally credited with breaking the story. Fehlau won the National Clarion Award for her work while the station won the regional Edward R. Murrow Award for investigative journalism. \"CBS, ABC and NBC, all had satellite trucks out in front of our station the next morning,\" Ledin said. \"Fehlau was on all the network shows.\""

Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate.",
    "doc": "AuthorStephen King once asked his publisher to pull one of his novels off the shelves.Six people had died \u2014 in real life.Four boys in 10 years brought guns to school. One killed a teacher and two students. Another shot five members of a prayer group, killing three. All four teenagers had read Rage, a book King wrote when he was a teen himself and published under another name.King, in a blunt, impassioned essay, wrote that when he learned of the copycat crimes, he wanted the book off the market. He argues the United States should do the same for assault weapons.\"You don\u2019t leave a can of gasoline where a boy with firebug tendencies can lay hands on it,\" he said in the 25-page piece, published Jan. 25, 2013, for Amazon Kindle readers.King, a Democrat who says he owns three handguns and supports the Second Amendment, argues stricter gun control \"would save thousands of lives.\" (His earnings from the sale of the essay will go the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.) He says Australia shows it\u2019s possible.In 1996, 28-year-old Martin Bryant shot and killed 35 people near the Port Arthur historic site, a popular tourist destination. After the shootings, the country banned and bought up automatic and semi-automatic long guns, destroying at least 600,000 in 12 months \u2014 ultimately about a third of its privately owned guns.It worked, King argues.\"Since the (Martin) Bryant killings and the resulting tough gun laws, homicides by firearm have declined almost 60 percent in Australia. The guns-for-everyone advocates hate that statistic, and dispute it, but as Bill Clinton likes to say, it's not opinion. It's arithmetic, honey.\"He likes talking to \"honey.\" He also drops a few F-bombs.We wanted to know: Have homicides by firearm in Australia dropped almost 60 percent? And did those \"tough gun laws\" do it? \u2018It\u2019s arithmetic, honey\u2019We asked King and Australian and American experts in gun violence for evidence.By a few different measures, the arithmetic works. Homicides by firearm did decline after 1996 \u2014 in fact, had already been in decline.One path to \"almost 60 percent\" comes from statistics compiled in part by Philip Alpers, a public health professor at the University of Sydney. The number of gun homicides fell from 69 in 1996 (excluding the 35 victims of the mass shooting prompting the laws) to 30 in 2012. That\u2019s a decrease of 56.5 percent.(And, yes, you read those numbers right \u2014 we didn\u2019t miss any zeros. The United States has about the same number of gun homicides every day as happened in Australia last year.)Then there\u2019s King\u2019s source, an item from Slate.com, he told us. It was a blog post citing a blog post citing a study \u2014 a reputable peer-reviewed piece in the American Law and Economics Review.The researchers, Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University, found that in the decade after the gun laws, firearm homicides dropped 59 percent.So, on the numbers, King has strong support.But did the 1996 laws drive the numbers? That\u2019s more vexing.\"He could be right. Or he could be wrong,\" said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center who wrote a helpful 2011 summary of the evidence. \" \u2026 The true answer is, we really don't know.\"Leigh and Neill designed their study to test for the law\u2019s effect. They asked whether death rates dropped more in states that destroyed relatively more banned weapons through gun buybacks.They found the buyback program drove down firearm suicides by almost 80 percent, with no significant change in suicides that didn\u2019t use guns. But the effect on homicides, while of \"similar magnitude,\" was less precise, they wrote \u2014 perhaps between 35 and 50 percent.Two other studies, which Hemenway described as flawed, found the laws made little difference. But their design made it nearly impossible to find an effect, he argues.The first, authored by members of the Australian gun lobby, highlighted the fact that before the law passed, the firearm homicide rate was already dropping. If it had continued on that track, they found, that would explain the entire change \u2014 showing the law made no difference. The authors cherry-picked a high year for homicides to start their analysis, then assumed deaths would drop at the same linear rate forever \u2014 with negative deaths by 2015.The second study was more sophisticated. Authors searched for a shift in deaths in a single year that might be attributed to the law, and found their tests suggested the law didn\u2019t \"have any large effects on reducing firearm homicide or suicide rates.\" Hemenway answers that the buyback occurred over two calendar years, in 1996 and 1997 \u2014 and the two-year drop was substantial. Gun homicides fell 46 percent.Australian experts told us the science leans King\u2019s way. But it\u2019s not yet definitive.\"The truth is that gun homicide did decline substantially after the toughening of Australia's gun laws and the massive gun buyback,\" said Don Weatherburn, director of the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research. \"The complication is that gun homicide was coming down before any of this. The academic debate is about whether the downward trend accelerated.\"His own view? That there\u2019s some evidence that tougher gun laws reduced the homicide rate, but it is \"far from conclusive.\"Paul Mazerolle, director of the Violence Research and Prevention Program at Griffith University in Brisbane, echoed that \"more definitive work is required.\"Some feel more certain the laws did their job.Simon Chapman, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney, co-authored a 2006 study showing faster falls in firearm deaths after the laws.\"Six years on, there still has not been a massacre,\" he told PolitiFact.But an even messier question is whether similar laws would work in the United States. Australia doesn\u2019t have domestic gun manufacturers \u2014 and has the benefit of being, you know, an island. Guns destroyed aren\u2019t so easily replaced."

    "justification": "The claim that President Barack Obama created \"five million jobs\" is incorrect. While it is true that during his presidency, the United States saw a net increase of nearly 5 million private-sector jobs, as evidenced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics seasonally adjusted data from February 2010 to October 2012, this figure does not account for public-sector job losses. When factoring in these losses, the net increase in total jobs is significantly lower, at around 4.5 million. Additionally, starting at different points during Obama's first year in office provides a less optimistic outlook on job growth. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "Before the two Democratic incumbents were re-elected Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez sought to put a number on President Barack Obama\u2019s record on the economy: 5 million new jobs.At an Oct. 27 campaign rally in Monmouth County, the senator claimed, \"this president has taken us from the abyss and from losing millions of jobs under Bush to having made 5 million jobs.\"Two days before voters headed to the polls, Menendez repeated the line at a Nov. 4 rally in Burlington County. Under Obama, the United States \"went from losing millions of jobs to creating 5 million jobs,\" Menendez told the crowd.Five million new jobs? Well, it depends when you start counting and what types of jobs you\u2019re talking about.Our PolitiFact colleagues issued a Half True ruling in October on a similar claim by Obama, who said his administration has created 5 million jobs \"over the last 30 months in the private sector alone.\"Like Obama\u2019s statement, Menendez\u2019s claim is accurate only when you consider the net increase of nearly 5 million private-sector jobs since February 2010, the low point in the private-sector job market.When you pull the yardstick back to different points during the first year of Obama's presidency, private-sector job growth has been less than what Menendez claimed. Also, in terms of total jobs, those private-sector gains have been offset by losses in the public-sector.A spokeswoman for Menendez declined to comment.Let\u2019s break down the numbers.As the end point for our analyses, we\u2019re using the preliminary figures for October 2012, the latest jobs data available at the time of Menendez\u2019s most recent statement.Between February 2010 and October 2012, Obama presided over the net creation of just under 5 million private-sector jobs, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.But the story changes slightly when you factor in the loss of public-sector jobs. Then, the net increase in total jobs has been about 4.5 million.Still, starting at February 2010 represents cherry-picking a time frame that provides the best possible outlook on job growth. Let\u2019s see what happens when we measure job growth from three separate starting points during Obama's first year in office: January 2009, when Obama was sworn in; February 2009, his first full month in office; and June 2009, the official beginning of the recovery, as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research.In short, those starting points show there\u2019s been less job growth than Menendez claimed.Since January 2009, there\u2019s been a net increase of 759,000 private-sector jobs. But given public-sector job losses, the net increase in total jobs has been 194,000.Since February 2009, the nation has gained 1,484,000 private-sector jobs and lost 566,000 public-sector jobs, leaving it with a net increase of 918,000 total jobs.Start at June 2009, and the net increase in private-sector jobs has been roughly 3.8 million. The net gain in total jobs lands at about 3.2 million, however, when factoring in the loss of 559,000 public-sector jobs.One last note: experts have said that presidents have a limited impact on employment changes. So, it\u2019s not appropriate to give Obama too much credit for job growth or too much blame for job losses."

    "justification": "The claim that \"if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent\" is true based on the evidence provided. The article explains that the standard measure of unemployment, known as U-3, only captures a portion of the total number of people who are underemployed or out of work. Specifically, it only includes those who are actively seeking work and have been looking for a job in the past 12 months.\n\nHowever, there are many others who want to work but have given up looking for employment, or who are working part-time despite preferring full-time work. These individuals are not included in the U-3 measure of unemployment. To get a more accurate picture of the total number of people who are struggling for work, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) offers an alternative measure known as U-6. This measure includes three additional groups: marginally attached workers, who want to work but have not searched for a job in the past 12 months; working part-time for economic reasons, who would rather be working full-time but cannot find a full-time job; and discouraged workers, who have stopped looking for work due to lack of opportunities.\n\nUsing this broader measure of unemployment, the article states that the U-6 rate was 15.1% in January 2012, which is significantly higher than the standard U-3 rate of 8.3%. This suggests that there are many more people who are struggling for work than the standard measure indicates.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the claim \"if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent\" is true.

    "doc": "The last time we rated a Mitt Romney claim on unemployment, we dinged him with a Half True for using a big number without describing it accurately. This time, he got it right.In a speech after winning the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 4, 2012, Romney said, \"If you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent.\"That's much more accurate than his statement at the Tampa debate on Jan. 23, when he said that \"we have 25 million Americans out of work.\" We rated that Half True, concluding that Romney had used a valid number but had described it incorrectly.Here\u2019s the background.Every month, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys a cross-section of Americans to determine, among other things, their employment status. The respondents are characterized as either being in the labor force or out of it.Those who are out of the labor force are not considered as seeking work at present. Some have no intention of working anytime soon -- they may be full-time students, stay-at-home parents, retired or physically unable to work. But others in this category are considered \"marginally attached\" to the labor force. They want work, are available to work and have looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months -- but by the BLS definition, they do not qualify as being in the labor force because they have not actively searched for work in the previous four weeks.Now let\u2019s look at those considered to be in the labor force. They are categorized as either employed or unemployed. The \"employed\" group also has a sub-category -- part-timers who would rather be working full-time but who aren\u2019t due to economic conditions.For the best-known unemployment rate figure, the BLS divides the total number of the unemployed (that is, those without jobs who are actively looking for work) by the number of people in the labor force (that is, unemployed workers plus employed workers, both full- and part-time).However, some critics have argued that this definition of unemployment is too limiting. So BLS also offers a broader, alternative measure of \"labor underutilization\" known as \"U-6.\" It calculates this by dividing the sum of three groups (unemployed, marginally attached to the labor force and working part time for economic reasons) by the sum of the labor force plus marginally attached workers. To make this methodology more concrete, let\u2019s compare how those numbers looked in January 2012, the most recent month available.The regular unemployment rate was 8.3 percent. However, the U-6 rate was significantly higher -- 15.1 percent. The difference stems from the fact that many workers are employed part-time when they\u2019d rather be full-time or have given up looking work, at least for now. (Here's a comparison of various BLS measures.)So Romney is right when he says that \"if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent.\" This is an improvement from his phrasing in the Tampa debate, when he didn\u2019t preface his statistic by noting that he\u2019s referring to the broader, U-6 methodology.A final bit of context: While it\u2019s certainly bad news to have 15.1 percent of the workforce either unemployed or under-employed, it\u2019s worth noting that this statistic, like the more commonly used unemployment rate, is heading in a favorable direction. After rising as high as 17.2 percent in October 2009, the U-6 is now as low as it\u2019s been since February 2009, the second month of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.That said, this level is still historically high. Since the statistic was first published in 1994, it has only broken into double digits for stretches following two previous recessions -- the recessions that hit in 1990-91 and 2001. And the U-6 peaks for those recessions were 11.8 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively -- well below even today\u2019s improved level."

    "doc": "Donald Trump is facing intense bipartisan backlash after saying Vietnam War prisoner of war Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is \"not a war hero,\" but an indignant Trump won\u2019t apologize. Trump defended his latest provocation on ABC\u2019s This Week, adding that McCain \"has done nothing to help veterans\" and suggesting the senator should actually apologize to him for insulting Trump supporters. When pressed by host Martha Raddatz, Trump complained that his critics are taking his comments out of context. \"Four times, I said he is a hero,\" he said on July 19, citing a fact-check by journalist Sharyl Attkisson. \"But you know \u2026 people choose little selective pieces. If you read what I say or watch what I say, which is even better, you\u2019ll say that there was nothing wrong.\" We took Trump\u2019s advice and put his statement in context. The backstory The McCain-Trump war of words started in a New Yorker article published July 16. Ryan Lizza asked McCain about Trump and his anti-immigration rally held last weekend in McCain\u2019s home state. McCain, as the article notes, led efforts to push through comprehensive immigration reform and \"has been at war with the far right in Arizona for years.\" \"This performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me,\" McCain told Lizza, \"Because what he did was he fired up the crazies.\" Trump couldn\u2019t take this lying down and retaliated on Twitter: (For the record, McCain graduated 894th out of a class of 899.) When Trump attended a rally in Ames, Iowa, on July 18, Republican pollster Frank Luntz asked him if calling McCain \"a dummy\" was appropriate. Trump recounted his beef with McCain before questioning his status as war hero in a back and forth with Luntz. Here\u2019s a transcript of their conversation: Trump: \"(McCain) insulted me and he insulted everybody in that room. And I said somebody should run against John McCain, who has been, in my opinion, not so hot. And I supported him for president. I raised $1 million for him. That\u2019s a lot of money. I supported him, he lost, he let us down. But he lost and I never liked him much after that 'cause I don\u2019t like losers. But, but \u2014 Frank, Frank, let me get to it. Luntz: \"He\u2019s a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero \u2026\" Trump: \"He\u2019s not a war hero ...\" Luntz: \"He\u2019s war hero.\" Trump: \"He is a war hero ...\" Luntz: \"Five and half years in a Vietnamese prison camp \u2026\" Trump: \"He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren\u2019t captured. So he\u2019s a war hero \u2026\" Luntz: \"Do you agree with that?\" Trump: \"He\u2019s a war hero, because he was captured, okay? I believe, perhaps, he\u2019s a war hero. But right now he said some very bad things about a lot of people. So what I said is John McCain, I disagree with him that these people aren\u2019t crazy.\" Trump literally said McCain \"is a war hero\" five times, but always with strings attached. Twice, he was interrupted by Luntz before he could finish his sentence. Once, the statement was preceded by \"I believe, perhaps.\" And the last two times, Trump added \"because he was captured.\" He also, of course, started all this by saying McCain is \"not a war hero.\" Experts told us these caveats change the meaning of the sentence entirely. \" \u2018He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured\u2019 implies that anybody who is captured is called a war hero, but there\u2019s really nothing special about them,\" said Kathleen Kendall, who studies political campaign communication at the University of Maryland. McCain, whose war record has been the subject of false attacks before, was taken prisoner by the Vietcong when his plane was shot down in 1967. For five and a half years, he was tortured and held in solitary confinement amid attempts by the North Vietnamese to obtain information and false confessions, according to the Navy. As the son of an admiral, McCain was offered an early release but refused until POWs who had been at the camp for longer than him were let go. We\u2019re not remarking on whether captivity is a marker of heroism, but Trump likely wasn\u2019t either, says rhetoric scholar Paul Achter of the University of Richmond. \"(Trump) appears to have thought it would be a funny aside to the question he was answering,\" he said. In short, Trump\u2019s self-defense is flimsy at best. As for his accusation of critics cherry-picking his comments, experts say the pot is calling the kettle black. \"He\u2019s taking his own words out of context. That\u2019s the offense he\u2019s charging the media with,\" Kendall said. We reached out to the Trump campaign for a response but didn\u2019t hear back."

    "doc": "Virginia needs a dose of Republican economic medicine to get out of a funk, says Glen Sturtevant, a Richmond School Board member who is running for the state Senate. \"Last year, we had zero percent growth in GDP in Virginia -- zero percent,\" Sturtevant said during an Aug. 18 candidates forum, sponsored by WCVE Richmond Public Radio. \"The only states that did worse than us were Alaska and Mississippi.\" Sturtevant is seeking the 10th District Senate seat that long has been held by Republican John Watkins, who is not seeking reelection. Also running is Dan Gecker, a Democrat who serves on the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors; Marleen Durfee, an independent who is a former Chesterfield supervisor; and Carl Loser, a Libertarian from Powhatan County. We wondered whether Sturtevant\u2019s dreary economic statistics were correct. A spokesman for his campaign said the information came from a June article in The Washington Post about preliminary state gross domestic product figures for 2014 that were released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the U.S. Department of Commerce. GDP is the value of all finished goods and services produced. Virginia\u2019s GDP of about $427 billion last year was indeed flat -- there was 0.0 percent inflation-adjusted growth from 2013. Only two states trailed the Old Dominion in growth: Mississippi and Alaska, which saw their state economies shrink. Nationally, inflation-adjusted GDP expanded by 2.2 percent last year. These figures are preliminary, and Virginia\u2019s position might improve slightly when the bureau releases its final report in September. Last year, for example, the preliminary report ranked Virginia 49th in economic growth in 2013; the final ranking pegged Virginia\u2019s growth at 0.4 percent, 43rd among the states. The commonwealth\u2019s economic growth has been lackluster for several years, spanning Democratic and Republican governors. In 2011, the state saw 0.6 percent GDP growth; in 2012, it saw 0.7 percent growth. Economists we spoke with said Virginia\u2019s low numbers largely reflect a slow recovery from the Great Recession that has been exacerbated by its dependence on federal spending in an era of budget cuts. Virginia is home to large military bases and a fleet of defense and government contractors and federal workers that drive the economy of Northern Virginia. The Pew Charitable Trusts estimates that in 2013, federal spending was responsible for about 31 percent of Virginia\u2019s economic activity. Only Mississippi was more dependent. Under the federal sequestration compromise, which kicked in at the start of 2013, Congress and the White House agreed to an automatic series of budget cuts to trim the national debt by $1 trillion over nine years. Half of the savings are coming from defense spending and half from domestic programs. A 2013 study by Stephen Fuller, director of the Center of Regional Analysis at George Mason University, said Virginia was \"particularly vulnerable\" to sequestration and predicted it would bite $15.4 billion a year out of the state\u2019s economy. That was the second largest of any state. Fuller found California was projected to lose $16.7 billion. Texas was third, projected to lose $11.9 billion annually. Both of those states are seeing much greater growth than Virginia: Texas ranked second in the nation last year, with 5.2 percent growth; California ranked ninth with 2.8 percent growth. It should be noted, however, that both states have larger, more diverse economies than Virginia. California\u2019s GDP was $2.1 trillion last year, Texas\u2019 was $1.5 trillion, and Virginia\u2019s was $427 billion, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis figures. Maryland, where many federal employees live, ranked 36th in economic growth last year. Although Maryland also is home to many federal employees, it\u2019s less dependent on federal spending than Virginia. According to Pew, Uncle Sam funds about 27.5 percent of the economic activity in Maryland. While federal cuts start the discussion about Virginia\u2019s sluggish recovery from the recession, they\u2019re not the whole conversation. The state has also been hurt by the sagging coal industry in Southwest Virginia and declining furniture manufacturing in Southside Virginia, according to Terry Terry Rephann, regional economist at the University of Virginia\u2019s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service."

North Carolina didn't have a Republican governor until over a decade after 9/11. Therefore, it was not possible for McCrory to have taken any action related to driver's licenses for illegal aliens during his term.\n2. North Carolina is not among the 14 states and territories that allow immigrants living in the country illegally to get a driver\u2019s license.

However, McCrory himself opposed expanding driver\u2019s license eligibility to immigrants living here illegally.\n4. The REAL ID Act of 2005 mandated states to require proof of citizenship for REAL ID driver\u2019s licenses and identification cards, which prevented immigrants living in the U.S. illegally from getting licenses.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that Malkin's claim is incorrect and that McCrory did not \"shepherd in\" driver's licenses for illegal aliens in the aftermath of 9/11.

    "doc": "A conservative pundit called out former North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory for taking a liberal stance on immigrants\u2019 access to driver\u2019s licenses. During a recent appearance on Fox\u2019s The Ingraham Angle, Laura Ingraham and Michelle Malkin discussed Republican Dan Bishop\u2019s victory in the 9th Congressional District race. Malkin praised Bishop for his commitment to the conservative agenda and suggested that other Republicans had gone astray. She said, \"It was a previous North Carolina governor who was a Republican who shepherded in driver's licenses for illegal aliens in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\" Malkin is a political blogger, commentator, and author whose work focuses on immigration and corruption. She appeared on the show to discuss her new book, \"Open Borders Inc.: Who's Funding America's Destruction?\" Her claim seemed fishy to us for a few reasons. First, the state didn\u2019t have a Republican governor until over a decade after 9/11. Also, North Carolina isn\u2019t among the 14 states and territories that allow immigrants living in the country illegally to get a driver\u2019s license. There\u2019s actually a bill in the General Assembly to do this, but it hasn\u2019t passed. So, we decided to look into her claim and found there was little to support it. We assume she was talking about former Governor Pat McCrory, because he was the only Republican to hold the office since 9/11. During his term, DACA recipients became eligible for driver\u2019s licenses. However, McCrory opposed allowing immigrants living in the country illegally to get drivers\u2019 licenses. It\u2019s quite a stretch for Malkin to say he \"shepherded in\" those privileges. Limitations on driver\u2019s licenses for immigrants in NC Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have passed laws to make immigrants living in the country illegally eligible for driver\u2019s licenses, according to a report by the National Conference of State Legislatures in July 2019. North Carolina is not one of them. That wasn\u2019t always the case. In the 1990s and early 2000s, those immigrants could get driver\u2019s licenses in North Carolina. In a New York Times article from August 2001, Wayne Hurder, the state\u2019s director of driver\u2019s license certification, explained the reasoning behind the policy. ''We think it's in the best interests of everyone in the state if we can get them to learn the laws of the road and get insurance. It's not our job to get into national immigration policy \u2014 this is a purely practical decision,\" Hurder said at the time. But in response to 9/11, Congress launched several efforts to strengthen domestic security. The REAL ID Act of 2005 mandated states to require proof of citizenship for REAL ID driver\u2019s licenses and identification cards. REAL IDs are required by federal agencies for people who want to access federal facilities, board federally-regulated airplanes, and enter nuclear power plants. The law is being phased in with a final deadline in October 2020. In 2005, then-Governor Mike Easley, a Democrat, followed the mandate and signed a law that specified driver\u2019s license applicants must provide a valid Social Security Number, which prevented immigrants living in the U.S. illegally from getting licenses. Before then, applicants could provide an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number instead. In recent years, a group of Democratic state representatives have been pushing another bill called the Safer Roads and Communities Act. It also would enable those immigrants to get licenses. The bill\u2019s supporters argue that if more drivers are trained and insured, roads will be safer for everyone. DACA recipients are eligible We reached out to Malkin about her claim but did not hear back. It seems likely that she was referring to a policy change in 2013 to allow immigrants who qualified for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to get North Carolina driver\u2019s licenses. (They are a small subset of the immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, accounting for about 15%.) Pat McCrory, who is the only Republican governor since 9/11, was in office at the time. Neither the REAL ID Act of 2005 nor the recent bills in the General Assembly were in play during his term. DACA was a program established under President Barack Obama that would defer deportation for \"Dreamers\" \u2014 young immigrants who illegally entered the United States as children \u2014 who met certain criteria. Immigrants with the new status could apply for a Social Security card and legally work in the United States. But the North Carolina DMV wasn\u2019t sure how to handle driver\u2019s license applications from DACA recipients and asked the attorney general\u2019s office to weigh in. In January 2013, then Attorney General Roy Cooper released a legal opinion that said DACA recipients were entitled to driver\u2019s licenses. When we asked McCrory about the policy, he emphasized that the driver\u2019s licenses issued to DACA recipients included the phrases \"Legal Presence\" and \"No Lawful Status.\" The former governor said, \"We were following the law reluctantly.\" McCrory also told us that he opposed expanding driver\u2019s license eligibility to immigrants living here illegally. When a 2015 bill was introduced that proposed to do just that, McCrory\u2019s legislative liaison told lawmakers, \"He is concerned with the provision providing driving privileges to those who are in this country unlawfully.\""

This lack of clarity leads to a conflicting interpretation of the claim, and therefore justifies the label \"Conflicting\".",
    "doc": "President Barack Obama regularly disregards laws to impose his preferred policies, Ted Cruz maintains. The Republican senator from Texas hammered that theme in a May 6, 2014, report, the fourth in a series, listing dozens of his concerns covering some previously fact-checked terrain such as work waivers for individuals on Temporary Aid to Needy Families, a topic reviewed by PolitiFact in 2012, plus administration moves softening or putting off parts of the Democrat-propelled 2010 health care law. Cruz set us to digging by declaring the administration \"spent $205,075 in \u2018stimulus\u2019 funds to relocate a shrub that sells for $16.\" This shrub, shown here after it was uprooted from its original site, prompted Ted Cruz\u2019s claim (photo by California Department of Transportation, received by email May 22, 2014). Really? Reported by CNSNews.com The basis for this claim, footnoted in the report, was an April 12, 2012, news article posted online by the CNSNews.com, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said by email. The Virginia-based service says its goal is to \"provide an alternative news source that would cover stories that are subject to the bias of omission and report on other news subject to bias by commission.\" According to the story, \"Shovel Ready in San Fran: $205,075 to \u2018Translocate\u2019 One Shrub from Path of Stimulus Project,\" various agencies in 2010 transplanted a type of bush spotted in San Francisco that until then had been believed extinct in the wild for more than 60 years; the shrub was moved from a highway median where it blocked a stimulus-supported highway renovation to an undisclosed local location where it could continue to bloom in the wild. Meantime, the story said, commercial versions of the Franciscan manzanita, or Arctostaphylos franciscana, could be purchased locally for $15.98 or $18 each. An article about the uncovered plant, on the web page for a Los Angeles botanical garden, says Franciscan manzanitas typically grow about 12 inches tall and spread by rooting branches to form masses from 4 to 6 feet (or more) wide. According to the description, white- to pink-blushed urn-shaped flowers are produced in small terminal clusters. CNSNews.com quoted a spokeswoman for the Presidio Parkway project, Molly Graham, as saying that digging up the uncovered plant, putting it on a truck and driving and planting it elsewhere cost $100,000. The story noted other plant-related costs in a Dec. 21, 2009, 15-year memorandum of agreement involving various agencies teamed up to save and propagate the plant found near the south entrance to the Golden Gate Bridge. In the agreement, the California Department of Transportation, or CalTrans, agreed to transfer $79,470 to \"fund the establishment, nurturing, and monitoring of the Mother Plant in its new location for a period not to exceed ten (10) years following relocation and two (2) years for salvaged rooted layers and cuttings\u2026\" Receiving the money: the federal Presidio Trust, which describes itself as devoted to transforming the Presidio section of San Francisco to a new purpose. CalTrans also agreed to transfer $25,605 to the trust to cover reporting requirements of the initial 10-year period. Adding these figures to the $100,000 to uproot, move and re-plant the shrub leads to total translocation costs of $205,075, CNSNews.com said, not counting up to $23,500 in other post-move shrub-connected costs it identified from the memo. Stimulus money contributed to road project And how did the Obama administration figure in? CNSNews.com reported that grants funded by the economic stimulus package, approved by the Democratic-majority Congress and signed into law by Obama in 2009, are helping to fund the ongoing replacement of an approach to the Golden Gate bridge, which has a total expected cost of $1.045 billion. Some $130 million in stimulus grants, the story said, breaks down to $83.28 million awarded Dec. 24, 2009 (about a month before the bush move) and $46 million awarded Dec. 30, 2010. Our hunt for other accounts of the shrub shift yielded an earlier news story pegging the costs of the shrub move at $175,000--\"$140,000 to dig up and move the shrub, and $35,000 for \u2018support\u2019 services from geological, botanical and climate experts in preparation for its new home in the Presidio less than a mile away,\" according to a San Francisco Chronicle news story posted online June 2, 2010. Like the CNSNews.com article, the Chronicle story was silent on whether stimulus aid paid for the shrub move. Plant in wild distinct from commercially cultivated version? Separately, botanists declared a difference between the plant found in the wild and others like it. In an April 20, 2012, blog post, the Berkeley, Calif.-based Bay Nature Institute, which says it\u2019s dedicated to educating residents about the beauty of the surrounding natural world, quoted Dan Gluesenkamp, the botanist who originally noticed the lone plant as he drove by the median, as saying it\u2019s misleading to equate the wild Franciscan manzanita with the domesticated version found in garden stores, which has been hybridized for features like pretty flowers, Gluesenkamp said. \"You can go buy a dog for $15 or $230,\" he said, \"but it\u2019s not the same as a wolf in the wild.\" The blog post continued: \"The Franciscan manzanita found in garden stores is an offshoot of a wild specimen taken in 1947 from a Laurel Hill cemetery, one of the few remaining wild locations at the time. As the story goes, some of the last remaining wild specimens were salvaged by James Roof, the founding director of the Regional Parks Botanic Garden in Berkeley. In a clandestine nighttime rescue, plantswoman Lester Rowntree \u2018garnered it ghoulishly in a gunnysack\u2019 and gave it a new home in her garden. A few more plants found their way into nurseries and botanic gardens, but the species\u2019 known wild habitat was no more,\" the institute said. In September 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated the surviving wild manzanita as an endangered species, according to a Sept. 4, 2012, Chronicle news article. Agency: Shrub's move covered by local road tolls Asked how the shrub's move was funded, a CalTrans official, David Yam, replied by email that $148,000 spent to uproot the 21,000-pound plant and move, replant and initially preserve it came from tolls collected on bridges near San Francisco by the Bay Area Toll Authority--not stimulus aid. Yam said major post-move costs, in accord with the memorandum of agreement, are drawing on $105,000 in federal funds, though (again) no stimulus money, he said. Shopping for a Franciscan manzanita Yam agreed a similar cultivated Manzanita plant can be purchased commercially, but he said a 21,000-pound wild Manzanita isn't available. He provided a background document stating the plant discovered on the median is one of three remaining \"wild\" species of the bush; the others are in botanical gardens, the document states. \"Cuttings from the 'wild' plant cannot be purchased by the public,\" the document states. We briefly shopped online for a manzanita Franciscana without finding one. By telephone, Bart O\u2019Brien, a manager at the Regional Parks Botanic Garden in Berkeley, Calif., said that occasionally the garden sells plants, descended from the manzanita Franciscana salvaged from the San Francisco cemetery in the 1940s. When sales happen, he said, the plants sell for $10 to $25. The sold plants are of the same species as the bush saved during the ongoing highway project, O'Brien said, but they\u2019re not the same because they're not growing in the wild. Cruz unmoved Updated on our findings, Frazier said by email the bush never would have been shifted if not for the stimulus-supported road project. Moving the plant wasted tax dollars, she said, and Cruz stands by his claim."

    "justification": "The claim that Charlie Crist allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year is True. The evidence provided in the article supports this claim. In 2007, when Crist took office, the state Legislature set undergraduate rates with no cap on how much the price could go up. Later that year, the Legislature let the largest state research universities raise rates up to 15 percent per year. Crist opposed raising tuition in 2007, but he later reversed himself and the 5 percent hike took effect. The Legislature approved a new plan in 2009 that allowed the Board of Governors to raise undergraduate tuition rates past whatever the Legislature approved, as long as the total increase didn\u2019t exceed 15 percent per year. Crist advocated for this plan and signed it off when the Legislature approved it.\n\nThe article explains how the process worked: both the Legislature and the Board of Governors had a role in raising tuition.

The total increase couldn\u2019t add up to more than 15 percent. The governor could veto the Legislature's increase but not the Board of Governors' increase.\n\nUnder Crist's administration, the legislative increase was 5 percent in 2007, and the board of governors increased tuition by 7 percent, resulting in a total increase of 12 percent. In 2008, the legislative increase was 6 percent, and the board of governors increased tuition by 9 percent, resulting in a total increase of 15 percent.

The article provides specific examples of how this played out under his administration, including the legislative and board of governors increases in each year. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "Education spending is a weapon of choice for both sides of the battle lines in this year\u2019s Florida gubernatorial election. This time around, Gov. Rick Scott is again lobbing an incendiary charge at his presumptive Democratic challenger. \"Charlie Crist allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year,\" Scott\u2019s political committee Let\u2019s Get to Work said in a statewide campaign ad, which launched June 2, 2014. It then goes on to say Scott repealed the increase. This attack is worded a bit differently from a claim we checked a couple months ago and found Mostly False. Let\u2019s check the report card on this one again. Calculating costs Scott for Florida told us the commercial refers to the 2009 plan to set tuition rates for Florida universities. Before Crist took office in 2007, the state Legislature set undergraduate rates with no cap on how much the price could go up. The university system\u2019s Board of Governors set graduate and out-of-state rates, capped at 15 percent. That system changed later that year, when the Legislature let the largest state research universities raise rates up 15 percent per year. Crist opposed raising tuition in 2007, and vetoed a 5 percent increase set by lawmakers. He reversed himself later that year, and the 5 percent hike took effect. The Legislature\u2019s increase was 6 percent in 2008, with the state\u2019s five largest universities getting additional tuition bumps. Crist signed that year\u2019s budget without challenging the changes. But in 2009, the Legislature approved a new plan that allowed the Board of Governors to raise undergraduate tuition rates past whatever the Legislature approved. As long as the total increase didn\u2019t exceed 15 percent per year, they were allowed to do this until tuition reached the national average, which was $8,893 in 2012-13. Crist advocated for this plan, and signed off on it when the Legislature approved it. That\u2019s the basis of the ad\u2019s attack. At the time, universities argued the system needed to raise tuition to pay for scholarships, keep top professors and compete with other states. (Florida was 45th in tuition costs in 2011, and 43rd by 2013.) The need only increased after the Legislature starting slashing post-secondary education funding following the Great Recession, some university officials argued. How did the process work? Stick with us here. It\u2019s a little complicated, because under tuition differential rules, both the Legislature and the Board of Governors had a role in raising tuition. The Legislature set its base tuition increase each year (it would go up by the rate of inflation if no budget action was taken). Then individual universities would ask the Board of Governors for another increase, called tuition differential. Those two numbers, the base increase and the differential, couldn\u2019t add up to more than 15 percent. It can be less, but has been 15 percent a few times -- notably when both Crist and Scott were governor. The governor could veto the Legislature's increase, but not the Board of Governors increase. He appoints the Board\u2019s members, but has no official say in their decisions. Here\u2019s how the tuition increases played out under both Crist and Scott: Year (Governor in office) Legislative increase Board of Governors increase Total 2007 (Crist) 5 percent N/A 5 percent 2008 (Crist) 6 percent N/A 6 percent 2009 (Crist)* 8 percent 7 percent 15 percent 2010 (Crist) 8 percent 7 percent 15 percent 2011 (Scott) 8 percent 7 percent 15 percent 2012 (Scott) 0 percent Varied by university Varied by university 2013 (Scott) 3 percent (vetoed) 0 percent 1.7 percent (indexed to inflation) * Tuition differential law takes effect Scott definitely used his veto power to stop the Legislature in 2013, but it was his influence on the Board of Governors that kept last year\u2019s hike so low. The governor may not be able to veto the board, but he certainly can express an opinion to its members, which he did. Now that we\u2019ve gone through all this for purposes of fact-checking the ad, you can forget about it for future tuition increases: The entire tuition differential process was scrapped by the Legislature during the 2014 session as part of a bill allowing children of illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition. Now automatic tuition increases are gone, even for inflation; the Legislature can vote for one, and only the University of Florida and Florida State can lobby the Board for a differential increase, up to a maximum of 6 percent."

    "claim": "Says that in 2001, Rick Perry spoke favorably of binational health insurance between Mexico and Texas.",
    "taxonomy_label": "temporal",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim that Rick Perry spoke favorably of binational health insurance between Mexico and Texas in 2001 is supported by the evidence provided. In an August 22, 2001 speech at a summit on border issues hosted by the University of Texas-Pan American, Perry mentioned a legislative proposal that recognized the need to address health care problems throughout the region and established a committee to assess the health care needs of the border area. The Interim Committee on Binational Health Benefit Plan Coverage later conducted a study that outlined cost savings generated by binational insurance plans in Texas, as well as legal and practical impediments to implementing them. While Perry's campaign did not respond to questions about his stance on binational health insurance, the evidence suggests that he was at least open to the idea of exploring it further. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "In the Sept. 22, 2011, Republican presidential debate, Rick Santorum called Rick Perry soft on illegal immigration, citing the Texas governor's continued support for a state law allowing some children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. Also, Santorum said, Perry \"gave a speech in 2001 where he talked about binational health insurance between Mexico and Texas. I mean, I don't even think Barack Obama would be for binational health insurance.\" We wondered whether Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, was right in insinuating that Perry spoke in favor of binational health insurance in 2001. First, some background: Binational, or \"cross-border,\" health insurance refers to coverage that provides benefits in two countries or in a country other than the one in which an enrollee lives or works. California has been a leader in binational plans, according to a 2010 report by David Warner, a professor at the University of Texas LBJ School of Public Affairs. He told us in an interview that although plan specifics differ, the general idea is for U.S. employers to offer their workers a choice between receiving their health care services exclusively in Mexico or getting standard U.S.-based coverage. Workers may live and work in the United States or may live in Mexico and commute across the border to legally work on the U.S. side. Warner's report says that at least four U.S. insurers offer binational plans that allow enrollees to access networks of providers in Mexico. For example, Blue Shield of California's \"Access Baja\" option generally restricts enrollees, who must live within 50 miles of the California-Mexico border, to seeking care through providers in the Mexican border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali. Proponents say that because binational plans are cheaper than standard U.S. plans (primarily because health care is cheaper in Mexico), they make it easier for low-income workers to afford coverage. In Texas, the state Department of Insurance told us that it doesn't know of insurers offering cross-border plans. However, it's possible that some employers in the border area do \u2014 if they are \"self-funded,\" meaning they bear the financial responsibility and risks of coverage themselves. Such plans are not regulated by the agency. Texas proponents of binational plans have said they could help reduce the uninsured population in the state's border region. In 2010, 43 percent of border residents were uninsured, compared to 23 percent statewide, according to data from the Texas Department of State Health Services. Opponents have expressed concerns about the quality of care provided by Mexican health care providers and the inability of the state to monitor it. Back to Perry and his speech. According to an Aug. 31, 2011, Dallas Morning News blog post, Perry mentioned binational health insurance at an August 2001 summit on border issues. It was hosted by the University of Texas-Pan American in Edinburg, which is in the Rio Grande Valley about 10 miles from the Texas-Mexico border. According to news articles, the meeting brought together high-level government officials and business leaders from Mexico and the United States, including Norman Mineta, then the U.S. secretary of transportation. An Aug. 23, 2001, Morning News news article said panels at the summit weighed topics such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, water issues and border health concerns. Perry spoke to the gathering on Aug. 22, 2001. According to the text of his remarks, posted on his state website, he was upbeat about increased cooperation and trade between the United States and Mexico. And he called for the two nations to work together to solve shared problems. Perry then touched on infrastructure, trade and water issues before focusing on health care. He singled out several problems in border areas, including a lack of preventive care and the limited availability of medical specialists. \"We have much to gain if we work together to expand preventative care and treat maladies unique to this region,\" Perry said. Perry next said a legislative proposal by then-state Rep. Pat Haggerty, R-El Paso, and state Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., D-Brownsville, \"establishes an important study that will look at the feasibility of binational health insurance. This study recognizes that the Mexican and U.S. sides of the border compose one region, and we must address health care problems throughout that region.\" Lucy Nashed, a spokeswoman in the governor\u2019s office, confirmed that Perry's mention of a binational health insurance study referred to a bill passed during the 2001 legislative session that created a committee to \"assess the health care needs of the border area\" and \"the affordability, cost-effectiveness, economic impact, and improved health status achievable through binational health benefit plan coverage.\" Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for Perry's presidential campaign, said the study \"ultimately concluded there were numerous barriers to accomplishing\" binational health insurance, \"and the Legislature took no further action on this concept.\" The January 2003 report by the Interim Committee on Binational Health Benefit Plan Coverage, first discusses health care concerns in the Texas border region and California's experience with binational health insurance. It then lays out cost savings that binational insurance plans were projected to generate in Texas, as well as legal and practical impediments to implementing them. The report closes with 10 scenarios for moving forward if the Legislature \"determines that binational health plans are a viable option to provide affordable health plans.\" The scenarios range from changing state law covering health maintenance organizations to allow for binational options to setting up a pilot project that would allow the plans to be offered in one part of the border region. In 2007, Sen. Lucio and Rep. Jose Menendez, D-San Antonio, introduced proposals to allow for the offering and regulating of \"cross border\" health benefit plans covering medical services within 75 miles of either side of the border. Those measures died. We asked Perry's campaign whether he favors binational health plan options for border residents and received no response. Separately, we reviewed news accounts and other Perry speeches and statements for signs that Perry talked up binational health insurance before or after his 2001 speech. We found one earlier reference, in an Aug. 6, 2001, \"editorial\" on the governor\u2019s state website describing how legislation passed during that year's session would help the border region. Perry highlighted the same bill that led to the 2003 report: \"We further addressed health care needs through House Bill 2498, which establishes an interim study to provide recommendations for the development of affordable and accessible health care coverage \u2014 including the possibility of bi-national health care coverage \u2014 along the Texas-Mexico border region.\" Earlier in 2001, Perry vetoed a measure calling for state health officials to develop a statewide \"strategic health plan,\" including an examination of how increased trade with Mexico had affected the border region. In a statement, Perry said one reason for the veto was \"the failure to include a binational approach to developing the plan.\" \"Effective solutions should also involve the cooperation and the commitment\" of Mexico, Perry said."

The article cites data from the Census Bureau that supports this claim. In 2012, among Americans aged 18 to 64 who worked full-time, year-round, the poverty rate was only 2.9 percent. This suggests that having a job significantly reduces the likelihood of being in poverty.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this figure may not accurately reflect the entire population of workers, as the article points out that there are people who have jobs but not full-time, full-year jobs. Among those with part-time jobs, the poverty rate is 16.6 percent, and among all workers (those with either full- or part-time jobs), the poverty rate is 7.3 percent. These figures suggest that while having a job greatly reduces the likelihood of poverty, it does not eliminate it entirely.\n\nThe article also highlights an additional point, which is that even among those who work full-time, year-round, there are still many who end up below the poverty line. Nearly 2.9 million people worked full-time for the whole year yet still ended up below the poverty line, according to the census figures.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim that \"If you have a job in this country, (there's a) 97 percent chance that you're not going to be in poverty\" is supported by the data provided, it is important to recognize that there are still many people who work hard but struggle to make ends meet.

    "doc": "Five decades after President Lyndon B. Johnson launched the War on Poverty, Fox News Sunday invited Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Fla., among others, to discuss the anniversary. Host John Roberts asked Southerland about ending current programs and moving to a system of block grants: \"You said, looking back on Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, it has failed and failed miserably. Do you keep putting more money into existing programs or do you -- as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) suggested earlier this week -- fundamentally reform everything, (taking) a big pot of money that the federal government has and (giving) that to the states to administer in innovative ways?\" Southerland responded, \"I think you have to look at the indicators -- the fundamentals of these programs. Look what causes poverty. We know that two-parent families (are) a child's greatest opportunity to avoid poverty. We know that a good quality education with daily parent involvement \u2026 reduces poverty. \u2026 If you have a job in this country, (there\u2019s a) 97 percent chance that you're not going to be in poverty. And so, therefore, I think there's a better way.\" Several readers asked us to check Southerland\u2019s claim that if you have a job, there\u2019s a \"97 percent chance\" that you're not going to be in poverty. We found Census Bureau data from 2012 that supports his claim. The Census Bureau found that 2.9 percent of Americans between 18 and 64 who worked full-time, year-round in 2012 were in poverty. However, we\u2019ll note a caveat. Southerland said \"if you have a job\" -- and there are people in the United States who have jobs, but not full-time, full-year jobs. Among Americans age 18 to 64 who have part-time jobs, the poverty rate is 16.6 percent. And among all workers -- Americans who have either a full- or a part-time job -- the rate is 7.3 percent. So a more accurate number for the likelihood of poverty \"if you have a job\" is 92.7 percent, or, rounding up, 93 percent. That\u2019s very close to 97 percent, but slightly off. \"While the percentages may vary slightly from one year to the next, independent sources make clear that your chances of living in poverty increase more than ten-fold if you don\u2019t have a steady, full-time job,\" saidMatt McCullough, a spokesman for Southerland. A final point: The census figures show that nearly 2.9 million people worked fulltime for the whole year yet still ended up below the poverty line. That may only be 2.9 percent of all full-time workers, but it\u2019s still a whole lot of people working, yet still ending up below the poverty line."

    "justification": "The claim that the bishops of the United States came out in 1919 for more affordable, comprehensive, and universal healthcare is True. The supporting article text provides evidence for this claim through several lines of argument:\n\nFirstly, the article mentions that the National Catholic Welfare Council, the predecessor of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, held an annual meeting in which U.S. bishops discussed national policy issues such as education, welfare, and healthcare. During the February 1919 meeting, a group of bishops led by Father John A. Ryan published the Bishops\u2019 Program of Social Reconstruction, which included a section on social insurance that advocated for comprehensive provision for insurance against illness, invalidity, unemployment, and old age. This document represents a clear statement of support for universal healthcare from the Catholic Church.\n\nSecondly, the article notes that the USCCB has consistently supported healthcare expansions over the years, including former President Bill Clinton\u2019s ultimately defeated healthcare plan in 1993. This suggests that while the bishops may have specific reservations about certain aspects of healthcare policy, they remain committed to the broader goal of ensuring access to comprehensive and universal healthcare.\n\nFinally, the article quotes Cardinal Timothy Dolan as saying that the bishops are \u201cfor universal, comprehensive, life-affirming health care.\u201d This statement further reinforces the conclusion that the bishops support universal and comprehensive healthcare.\n\nBased on these lines of evidence, it is clear that the claim that the bishops of the United States came out in 1919 for more affordable, comprehensive, and universal healthcare is supported by the provided evidence. Therefore, the label True is appropriate.",
    "doc": "The Catholic church and the White House have been clashing over contraception requirements in President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law. As we\u2019ve noted before, the Affordable Care Act requires Catholic hospitals to provide all birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration to their employers with no out-of-pocket costs, including birth control pills, Plan B, diaphragms and hormone shots. Coverage for emergency contraception, but not abortion, is required. \"Religious employers\" are exempt from the requirement, but the hospitals don\u2019t qualify for exemptions because they both employ and serve people who may not share their religious beliefs. In an interview with David Gregory on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, perhaps the most prominent member of the Catholic heirarchy in the United States, spoke out against a mandate for hospitals to provide these services, including emergency-contraception pills. At the same time, though, Dolan cited some common ground between the church and the administration it\u2019s been battling. \"We bishops have been really kind of in a tough place because we're for universal, comprehensive, life-affirming health care,\" Dolan said. \"We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care. That's how far back we go in this battle, okay?\" We wondered whether the bishops\u2019 support for comprehensive health care really goes back nearly a century. Experts pointed us to the history of the National Catholic Welfare Council, the predecessor of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The council held an annual meeting in which U.S. bishops discussed national policy issues such as education, welfare and health care. During the February 1919, meeting, held just after World War I, a group of bishops, led by a Catholic social reformer, Father John A. Ryan, published the Bishops\u2019 Program of Social Reconstruction, a guide to overhauling U.S. social justice. Dolan was referring to a section on social insurance, his spokesman said. \"The state,\" the guide read, \"should make comprehensive provision for insurance against illness, invalidity, unemployment, and old age.\" That wasn\u2019t the last time the USCCB has supported health care expansions. For example, the group has publicly supported a variety of proposals, including former President Bill Clinton\u2019s ultimately defeated health care plan in 1993. \"The flap is over the (contraception) issue,\" said Maria Mazzenga, a Catholic history archivist at The Catholic University of America. \"That\u2019s where it comes to appear that they\u2019re against universal health care.\" Mazzenga said that, despite opposition to one specific part of Obamacare, all but the most conservative bishops have consistently supported health care efforts over the years."

    "doc": "Some undocumented immigrants pay more in federal income taxes than Donald Trump, said Hillary Clinton Oct. 26 at a rally in Tampa, Fla. Less than two weeks before Election Day, the Democratic presidential nominee chastised her opponent for his hardline stance on immigration. \"By the way, one-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump pays,\" she said. Experts told us Clinton\u2019s claim is grounded in educated estimates about undocumented immigrants and knowledge of Trump\u2019s past tax practices. But they\u2019re still just estimates. Undocumented workers There is no official count of undocumented workers who pay federal income taxes. But Clinton\u2019s claim \u2014 that half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes \u2014 is an educated assumption that many experts use, said Kim Rueben, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \"As far as we can vet it, it is true,\" Rueben said. For reference, the Tax Policy Center estimates that 56 percent of the entire population pays federal income tax, while 44 percent don\u2019t. Social Security is one way we know undocumented workers pay federal income taxes. The Social Security Administration estimated that in 2009, 3.1 million unauthorized workers paid into Social Security via payroll tax, even though most will not be able to collect those benefits. In addition to Social Security, payroll taxes also withhold federal income taxes from a worker\u2019s paycheck. There\u2019s also the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, which people who are unable to obtain Social Security numbers use to pay income taxes, regardless of immigration status. In 2013, 4.3 million people filed tax returns using ITINs. ITIN filers paid $9 billion in payroll taxes in 2014. Most people with an ITIN are undocumented immigrants, said Ruth Wasem, a public policy professor at the University of Texas. The number of people signing up for ITINs and paying taxes that way has grown over the past few years, particularly because many immigration reform proposals require undocumented immigrants to prove they have been paying taxes in order to qualify for some sort of legal status, Wasem said. Between those who contribute via ITIN, others who have taxes withheld from their paycheck, and any overlap between the two groups, Wasem said Clinton\u2019s claim that half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes is likely a low ball estimate. Donald Trump While experts can make educated guesses about how many undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, there\u2019s still too much we don\u2019t know about Trump\u2019s tax returns to speculate how much he presently pays in federal income taxes. Going against decades of tradition for presidential nominees, Trump has so far refused to release his tax returns. We know there have been at least a few years Trump didn\u2019t pay federal income taxes and that tax write-offs are generally beneficial to real estate developers like Trump. Three pages of Trump\u2019s 1995 tax returns, uncovered and verified by the New York Times, show it\u2019s possible he was able to legally avoid paying federal income tax for as much as 18 years. A tax provision known as net operating loss allows people to report business losses on their personal tax returns as a deduction. So if a person\u2019s reported net operating loss is equal to or larger than their personal income, that person does not have to pay income taxes. Trump\u2019s $916 million loss reported in his 1995 tax return could counteract any income he earned that year and beyond, up to 18 years total under IRS rules in 1995, according to the New York Times. Going back a few more years, a 1981 report by New Jersey gambling regulators analyzed five years of Trump's finances as part of his efforts to get a casino license for a proposed casino-hotel complex. The report says Trump paid federal taxes for three of those five years, 1975-77, but he did not pay federal income tax in 1978 and 1979. So in the years Trump paid zero federal income taxes, undocumented immigrants who paid any federal income taxes presumably would have paid more than him. But Clinton\u2019s claim is phrased in the present. Without Trump\u2019s current tax returns, we simply don\u2019t know what his tax burden is today. So in the most recent tax year, we don\u2019t know who paid more in federal income tax, Trump or an undocumented worker."

    "doc": "Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s campaign has focused on painting the Republican incumbent as a friend of the environment, which means attempting to show Democratic challenger Charlie Crist isn\u2019t. A Republican Party of Florida commercial released Aug. 7, 2014, lambasts Crist for taking a supporter\u2019s personal aircraft to a press event. \"On his way to an event about -- get this -- green issues, Crist cruised in on a private jet,\" the narrator says. \"That\u2019s rich. What\u2019s richer? The jet belongs to a serial polluter with a history of environmental violations fined nearly $2 million for polluting water.\" That certainly sounded like fodder for headlines, but was it true? PolitiFact Florida attempted to pull the permits on this one and find out what happened. Campaign development The state GOP told PolitiFact the commercial stemmed from a plane ride Crist took from Gainesville to Tallahassee on July 25. While Scott uses his personal jet to attend events and has been criticized for a lack of transparency surrounding its use, Crist has often used private planes to help him get to events around the state. This time the Scott campaign took a photo of the 2005 Cessna 560XL\u2019s tail number and traced its ownership. The owner turned out to be James Finch, a Lynn Haven contractor who owns Phoenix Construction Services Inc., a company previously fined for environmental infractions. That was especially problematic for the flight in question, since Crist was attending a climate change lecture by Florida State University oceanography professor Jeff Chanton. Finch, a former NASCAR team owner, has a long history of political donations, giving tens of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party of Florida and John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign. He also has a history of facing fines from the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. While neither agency responded to PolitiFact Florida\u2019s requests for documentation of Finch\u2019s penalties, we were able to do a little digging on our own. On two occasions, in 1984 and 1996, he was cited for backfilling the bayou at his home. No action was taken on the first instance, but he was forced to pay a penalty and do restoration work on the second. A 1998 complaint about destruction of seagrass and another notice about a potential sewage spill at a Millville wastewater treatment plant were withdrawn for lack of evidence. His company Phoenix Construction Services was fined $23,000 by the EPA after filling in wetlands at a Panama Beach park against the terms of the project\u2019s U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit in 1999. Fill dirt is considered by law to be a pollutant in \"navigable wetlands.\" The Army Corps of Engineers issued a noncompliance notice after the company installed a portion of a sewage pipeline across St. Andrew Bay above ground against permitting guidelines. Finch\u2019s company was cleared when the work was corrected per DEP guidelines by 2005. The truly epic saga, however, was Phoenix\u2019s botched work at the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport, which opened north of Panama City in 2010. Crist in 2007 called the airport \"a national model for economic transformation and environmental preservation.\" Environmental groups had complained in 2009 that because of poor construction methods, the site was resulting in \"pollution in Burnt Mill Creek, Crooked Creek, West Bay and the surrounding wetlands.\" Later that year, Phoenix was fined $1.7 million by the DEP for environmental permit violations. The agency concluded the contractor did not follow stormwater runoff plans or erosion stabilization methods, allowing improperly filtered water to flow into nearby wetlands. As costs wildly overran, Phoenix and the airport authority first sued each other, then banded together to sue other parties working on the project before settling in 2012. Phoenix did not return PolitiFact Florida\u2019s request for comment. Phoenix continued to do work for the local government, though. The Bay County Commission in 2013 gave Phoenix a $25 million contract to build the county a water pumping station. The Crist campaign said the former governor didn\u2019t know about the environmental fines against Finch. They said Crist hasn't used the plane since July 27. The Scott campaign shouldn't be too quick to point fingers at Finch for pollution fines, however. Finch worked on the airport with Charles W. \"Chuck\" Roberts III, a Panhandle paving contractor whose company was accused of improperly building a parking lot in that project. The airport authority was eventually blamed for not securing the proper permit. C.W. Roberts Inc. plants in several counties have been cited for leaking or improperly storing chemicals or being in disrepair. Many of the company\u2019s infractions did not result in penalties. What is Roberts doing now? In 2011, Gov. Scott appointed him to a seat on the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission."

In fact, the data shows that while Florida lost 10,600 total government jobs from December 2011 to December 2012, it also saw an increase of 65,600 private-sector jobs during the same period. This means that the overall nonfarm jobs total for Florida in 2012 was a net gain of 54,900 jobs.\n\nThe claim made by the Democrats that Scott cut more jobs than he created is therefore not supported by the evidence. While it is true that the state experienced negative job growth during certain periods in 2012, this was not solely due to actions taken by Governor Scott. Economic experts have pointed out that governors usually have little influence on short-term economic performance in their states, and that national trends and general economic circumstances overwhelm the actions of a single governor.\n\nFurthermore, the article notes that Governor Scott made no secret of his desire to shrink the state payroll during his campaign, and that he did in fact cut state jobs by 5 percent, which is reflected in the label \"Promise Kept\" on the Scott-O-Meter. However, the evidence provided does not support the claim that he cut more government jobs than were created in the private sector in 2012.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it can be justly labeled that Governor Rick Scott did not cut more government jobs than were created in the private sector in Florida in 2012.",
    "doc": "On the eve of Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s third State of the State address, Florida Democrats released a lengthy memo detailing setbacks for job creation under his reign.\"After cutting more jobs than he created in Florida in 2012, failing to keep his promise to create 700,000 new jobs and a disastrous election year where the Florida GOP \u2018got their teeth kicked in,\u2019 Gov. Rick Scott is running away from everything he campaigned on to get re-elected,\" wrote Scott Arceneaux, the party\u2019s executive director, in the March 4 memo.His memo served up plenty of talking points for Democratic lawmakers at a press conference berating Scott\u2019s policies later that day. \"Scott cut more jobs than he created in 2012, and the jobs he created aren\u2019t high-quality, high-paying positions of the future,\" said Sen.

We should note first that it's not right to give Scott credit (or blame) for all job growth (or losses) that happens while he is governor. Economic experts have told us that governors usually have little influence on short-term economic performance in their states. Often, national trends and general economic circumstances overwhelm the actions of a single governor.On the other hand, public officials do have control over the size of the state workforce, and Scott made no secret of his desire to shrink the state payroll during his campaign. He said he would cut state jobs by 5 percent, a pledge we rated Promise Kept on the Scott-O-Meter.But did he weed out state worker jobs at such a rate that it overtook private sector growth? Put simply, no.In his memo, Arceneaux zeroed in on private vs. state government jobs in 2012.\"Since the beginning of 2012, Florida has added 7,800 private-sector jobs, but has cut 9,600 public sector jobs,\" he states in the memo, which offers an August 2012 report from the state\u2019s Department of Economic Opportunity as back-up.We noticed one problem right away. Arceneaux claims to make an overarching point about job losses exceeding gains for all of 2012. But the supporting evidence deals with federal labor data available through mid-August, accounting for just half of the year\u2019s jobs picture.We asked Florida Democratic Party spokesman Eric Conrad to explain. He sent us a 2012 news story from the Orlando Sentinel, which quoted Rollins College economics professor William Seyfried as saying Florida added about 7,800 private-sector jobs while cutting about 9,600 government positions -- this is key --so far that year.Conrad said this was the most recent report the party had.We found data for Florida jobs for all of 2012 from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.Yes, 2012 was not kind to the state\u2019s job market for the first half, Seyfried told us by phone. But federal data show it picked up after August.From December 2011 to December 2012, Florida lost 10,600 total government jobs. On the other hand, the state saw an increase of 65,600 private-sector jobs. Put them together and you get an overall nonfarm jobs total of 54,900 jobs -- a net gain, which belies Arceneaux\u2019s point.\"There\u2019s no way one can conclude that Florida experienced a net loss of jobs in 2012,\" Seyfried said. Florida's 2012 economic performance mirrored the country's underwhelming job growth, said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness. \"They pick six months (of Florida jobs data) and they say nothing about the role the Democratic president has played in a slow national recovery,\" Snaith said. Arceneaux\u2019s point is focused on the worst period of job growth the state experienced with Scott as governor. The state grew more than twice as many jobs in Scott\u2019s first year in office (122,900 private-sector jobs - 7,200 government jobs = 115,700 total nonfarm jobs). And by the end of 2012, Scott\u2019s job creation total continued to lag mightily behind his promise of 700,000 jobs but was up to 170,600."

    "justification": "Based on the provided evidence, it is appropriate to label the claim \"Every American now is $51,000 in debt\" as True. The Assemblywoman Caroline Casagrande is quoted as saying that every American owes the federal government $51,777.21, which is calculated by dividing the national debt of $16,295,297,196,000 by the total population of 314,719,484.\n\nThe evidence provided supports this claim as it cites a website that lists the national debt and provides explanations from federal budget experts. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, explains that what the nation owes each year on the national debt is annual interest and principal payments, and that taxpayers do not face the possibility of receiving a large bill in the mail anytime soon. Additionally, our PolitiFact colleagues in Virginia and New Hampshire have found similar claims to be accurate, with one rating it as True and the other as Mostly True.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label the claim \"Every American now is $51,000 in debt\" as True.",
    "doc": "Pity the poor children of the United States \u2013 they, along with their parents, are already in hock to the federal government for thousands of dollars.Assemblywoman Caroline Casagrande (R-Monmouth) made that claim Oct. 26 during an interview with Michael Aron on NJTV\u2019s \"On The Record.\"\"Every American now is $51,000 in debt,\" Casagrande told Aron. \"That\u2019s money I owe, that\u2019s money my children owe before they even go to kindergarten, that\u2019s their check to the federal government right now.\"Casagrande\u2019s number is solid, but she doesn\u2019t have to worry about whipping out her checkbook or debit card any time soon, some federal budget experts say.Let\u2019s start by reviewing the two commonly cited forms of national debt -- debt held by the public and total debt.Debt held by the public is money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public as well as money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare.Now let\u2019s look at the numbers in Casagrande\u2019s claim.The U.S. Government Debt website on Nov. 6 \u2013 the date we started looking into Casagrande\u2019s clam -- listed the national debt at $16,295,297,196,000. If that\u2019s divided by 314,719,484 -- the total U.S. population, according to the Census Bureau, each American owes the federal government $51,777.21.So, Casagrande\u2019s number is accurate. But should Americans actually expect to pay that bill? Not necessarily.Gary Burtless, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution who has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties, explained that what the nation owes each year on the national debt is annual interest and principal payments.\"Do grandma and the grandkids have to pay off the national debt, as Assemblywoman Caroline Casagrande seems to suggest? No, they do not,\" Burtless wrote. \"Our grandkids\u2019 great grandparents did not pay off the federal debt; neither did their parents or grandparents. There is no rule that the national debt has to be paid off in one generation, three generations, or even ten generations. Taxpayers do not face the possibility that they will receive a $51,000 bill in the mail anytime soon.\" An invoice might not be in the mail but Casagrande\u2019s statement is fair, according to spokespeople for the conservative Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute.\"We\u2019re not even going to pay off the debt, we\u2019re going to pay down the interest,\" said Matt Jensen, a research associate in Economic Policy Studies at the AEI. \" Under no proposal that I\u2019ve seen is someone paying down the debt in real dollars. What we\u2019re really talking about is paying the interest on the debt, forever. You\u2019ll pay the interest, your children will pay the interest.\"Our PolitiFact colleagues in Virginia and New Hampshire also looked into similar claims in their states and found that the amount of debt cited by their lawmakers was largely accurate.Virginia Rep. Randy Forbes in January said the national debt amounted to $48,700 for every American or $128,300 for every U.S. Household. Our colleagues rated the claim True.In August, PolitiFact New Hampshire rated Mostly True a claim by Rep. Frank Guinta that every child in the United States has a $50,000 share in the national debt. Guinta received a Mostly True because that would mean each of the nation\u2019s nearly 74 million children would owe $216,102. Guinta\u2019s figure was accurate, however, when the debt was spread across the entire population."

    "claim": "\"Existing law right now requires 700 miles of double-layered border fencing\" on the Mexico border.",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim that \"Existing law right now requires 700 miles of double-layered border fencing\" on the Mexico border is False. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 did require the construction of a double-layered fence along at least 700 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, but this requirement was later amended in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 to now mandate only \"reinforced fencing\" without specifying the height or material of the barrier. Therefore, the current law does not require double-layered fencing.\n\nThe article cites a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report that states they have fencing on 650 miles of the border, with only 36 miles covered by double-layered fencing. This indicates that the majority of the border is not equipped with double-layered fencing as claimed in the original statement. Additionally, the article quotes a DHS official who states that they believe they have enough fencing to meet their needs and that any additional fencing would not contribute to border security.\n\nBased on these facts, it is clear that the claim about existing law requiring 700 miles of double-layered border fencing is false. The law has been amended to no longer require double-layered fencing, and the current fencing infrastructure does not meet this standard.",
    "doc": "U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says President Barack Obama\u2019s border policies aren\u2019t just bad, they\u2019re illegal. \"Existing law right now requires 700 miles of double-layered border fencing,\" Cruz, a presidential candidate, said during a recent radio interview on \"The John Fredericks Show,\" broadcast in Portsmouth. \"The Obama administration refuses to do that. They\u2019ve built only 36 miles.\" We wondered if the law requires that the U.S.-Mexico border have a 700-mile span of \"double-layered fencing\" in which two barriers are set up, one in front of the other. Rick Tyler, a Cruz campaign spokesman, backed the senator\u2019s statement by pointing us to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which required that at least two layers of reinforced fencing be installed along five sections of the U.S.-Mexico border. Those sections totaled about 850 miles, although the fenced area would be somewhat less, because other means could be used to secure the border in areas with steep terrain. In areas of steep terrain, \"other means\" could be used to secure the border, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in an April 2015 report. The bottom line is, the law mandated a double-layered fence along a stretch of at least 700 miles, covering more than one-third of the roughly 1,900 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. But the law was amended in 2008 and loosened the fence requirements that Cruz continues to describe. The current law, contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, still mandates the construction of a fence covering \"not less than 700 miles\" of the border. But - key to this fact check - it erased the requirement that the fence be double-layered. Instead, the law mandates that \"reinforced fencing\" be erected. That generally means a barrier that\u2019s more durable and sturdy than a typical fence, but the law doesn\u2019t specify the barrier\u2019s height or that it be constructed from wire mesh or another material, according to the Congressional Research Service report. The new law \"now mandates only a single layer of reinforced fencing (while not precluding additional layers from being deployed, if deemed appropriate),\" the report says. So what has been built? The Department of Homeland Security says ithas fencing on 650 miles, according to the research service. About 350 miles of that fencing is designed only to deter pedestrian crossings and contains only one barrier layer. Another 300 miles is covered by a \"vehicle fence\" - barriers designed to stop cars and trucks from crossing the border but not people traveling by foot. Only 36 miles are covered by double-layered fencing, according to Homeland Security tallies. \"DHS (the Department of Homeland Security) believe they have all the fencing that they need and that any additional fencing would not contribute to border security,\" Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute, told us in an interview. Others disagree, saying the barrier is not enough. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which urges tighter immigration policies, noted the vehicle fencing provides no deterrent for people on foot. \"Your grandma could hop them,\" Krikorian told us in an email."

    "taxonomy_label": "interval",

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim because the evidence provided does not support the claim that the Department of Homeland Security did not request any flight hours for aerial surveillance from the Department of Defense in 2017.\n\nThe letter from R. Gil Kerlikowske, then the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, to Brian McKeon, who was a Department of Defense undersecretary, indicates that Congress has consistently appropriated DoD funds to assist CBP in securing the Southwest border. Additionally, Kerlikowske prioritized the allocation of those funds for rotary-wing assets (helicopters) to provide tangible benefits to border security. This suggests that DoD was willing and able to provide support to CBP in 2017.\n\nFurthermore, when asked for factual backup of the claim, Cuellar's press secretary provided contact information for a director with the Texas National Guard, who could verify that Operation Phalanx is a federal mission under CBP's direct control. This undermines Cuellar's initial claim that no flight hours were requested from the National Guard.\n\nFinally, the letter from Kerlikowske indicates that CBP welcomes the opportunity to maintain DoD aviation and associated support capabilities should funding be made available. This suggests that CBP values its relationship with DoD and wishes to continue its efforts to maximize the impact of any appropriations or other DoD activities along the Southwest border.\n\nIn light of this evidence, it is unclear why Cuellar claimed that no flight hours were requested from the National Guard in 2017. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "Last year, Texas officials includingSen. John Cornyn charged the federal government with surprisingly not requesting continued aerial checks of the U.S.-Mexico border as of January 2017. At issue: An element of Operation Phalanx, a border surveillance program launched in 2010 in which National Guard officers assist U.S. agents monitoring the border. Cornyn, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, said in a Nov. 22, 2016, letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson: \"It has come to our attention that for calendar year 2017 the Department of Homeland Security has not requested any flight hours for Operation Phalanx from the Department of Defense.\" Their letter, which came to our attention thanks to a reader inquiry, went on: \"Given the continuing surge of migrants along the Southern Border beyond the FY15 numbers and a large uptick in apprehensions already for the month of November 2016, we believe DHS should be requesting more surveillance and security resources, not less.\" Also, the letter called the described cut \"extremely imprudent.\" Some history: President Barack Obama issued an executive order in 2010 authorizing 1,200 soldiers and airmen to join Customs and Border Protection efforts along the southwest border. According to a May 2011 U.S. Army web post, the Army National Guard then established Operation Phalanx in July 2010, with soldiers working to spot border intrusions and providing technical support. In 2012, notably, the mission switched from ground operations to \"aviation focused support,\" according to the Texas Military Department, which is part of Texas state government. So, did the Obama administration not request additional flight hours just before 2017? In the end, we found, this claim didn\u2019t pan out. Along the way, too, neither the Texans who sent the letter nor federal officials came through with what we\u2019d consider to-the-point factual replies. Over several weeks, neither Cornyn nor Cuellar offered confirmable evidence for theirdeclaration that no flight hours were requested. Cornyn deferred to Cuellar, who told us by phone that he\u2019d heard about the move not to request more flight hours from a Texas official involved in the operation--someone we subsequently couldn\u2019t reach. Customs and Border Patrol letter Meantime, Cuellar brought to our attention a letter sent by a border security official indicating support for the operation. Cuellar\u2019s press secretary, Rafael Benavides, emailed us a copy of the letter, which was dated six days before the Texas officials leveled their claim, The letter from R. Gil Kerlikowske, then the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, to Brian McKeon, who was a Department of Defense undersecretary, opened: \"This letter serves to identify those Department of Defense activities most critical to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Border Security Operations.\" \"Over the last decade,\" the letter continued, \"Congress has consistently appropriated\" DoD \"funds to the Army National Guard and other supporting elements for the express purposes of assisting\" CBP \"in securing the Southwest border.\" Kerlikowske went on: \"I believe this support, whether under Operation Jump Start or Operation Phalanx, or other DoD activities, has continued to provide tangible benefits to border security both in countering illegal immigration and in preventing the flow of drugs and other illicit goods.\" Next, Kelikowske wrote that with Congress likely to continue such funding for fiscal 2017, which began in October 2016, he wanted to \"provide you with a general prioritization of those rotary-wing assets that have proven most critical to supporting our operations.\" That term, \"rotary-wing asset,\" refers to helicopters. \"Specifically,\" the letter continued, \"the allocation of appropriated resources for rotary wing operation in the following manner will most positively impact our operations,\" Kerlikowske wrote, including a prioritized list of areas he thought most important to focus on, with the Laredo sector prioritized, the Rio Grande Valley sector ranked second and the Tucson sector set third. Our initial attempts to verify the claim resulted in email circularity: After emailing Cornyn\u2019s press secretary, since the senator\u2019s name was listed first on the letter, we were told to check with Cuellar\u2019s office for factual backup of the claim. Cuellar\u2019s press secretary, Benavides, first emailed us contact information for a director with the Texas National Guard, Malcolm Warbrick, who would \"verify Operation Phalanx is shutting down due to a lack of request for support hours from DHS.\" When we emailed the director, though, we heard back by email from a National Guard spokeswoman, Laura Lopez, who told us to contact Homeland Security as \"Operation Phalanx is a federal mission under their direct control.\" Otherwise, Daniel Hetlage, a CBP spokesman, also referred to Kerlikowske\u2019s letter, saying: \"This support is important, the commissioner has indicated such, and U.S. Customs & Border Protection will take any hours the Department of Defense can provide.\" Our calls to the Department of Defense for information on requested flight hours didn\u2019t draw replies. By phone on Dec. 16, 2016, Cuellar responded to our requests for backup by describing what he said he\u2019d heard. On Nov. 14, 2016, Cuellar said, Warbrick, director of government affairs for the Texas Military Department, which is based at Camp Mabry in Austin, told Ryan Ehly, legislative director for Cuellar\u2019s office, about the lack of hours requested for aerial surveillance during a meeting in Washington. Cuellar\u2019s press secretary, Rafael Benavides, provided contact information for Warbrick, but our attempts to email and call Warbrick didn\u2019t yield factual fruit. Next, Cuellar told us, Brig. Gen. Patrick M. Hamilton, a commander of the Domestic Operations Task Force of the Texas Military Department, told Cuellar in a Dec. 7, 2016 meeting that Operation Phalanx was being discontinued since no 2017 flight hours had been requested from the National Guard. Precisely, Cuellar said, Hamilton told him \"that the program was going to go away,\" despite the fact that Congress had approved funding for the program in its Fiscal Year 2016 budget. Cuellar also brought up the mid-November Kerlikowske letter though Cuellar said the letter of support wasn\u2019t high-level enough to serve as a request for additional flight hours. That is, Cuellar maintained, such a letter needs to come from a secretary to a secretary to be meaningful. Cuellar told us he November letter, from a commissioner to an undersecretary, was \"just a feel-good request\" that wouldn\u2019t result in more flight hours. December 2016 letter While we were checking this claim, Benavides told us that Cornyn, Cuellar and Abbott had gotten a reply from Kerlikowske on Dec. 21, 2016. In that letter, Kerlikowske said he was writing on Johnson\u2019s behalf and that \"CBP welcomes the opportunity to maintain DoD (Department of Defense) aviation and associated support capabilities should funding be made available. We value our strong relationship with DoD and wish to continue our efforts in order to maximize the impact of any appropriations or any other DoD activities along the Southwest border.\" By email, Benavides told us that this response also didn\u2019t add up to a request for additional hours in the air. \"No official request for flight hours has been made that we are aware of,\" Benavides said."

    "doc": "U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, the punk rocker turned Democratic politician from El Paso, vowed to go against \"politics as usual\" in Washington while spreading the word about his quest to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in the 2018 elections. O\u2019Rourke, addressing Dallas supporters at a March 2017 campaign kickoff event, provided some detail as to what that means to him. Toward the end of his remarks, he asked for personal campaign donations, adding to cheers and applause: \"I\u2019m one of two members of Congress out of 535 that takes no corporate cash, no political action committee money. I don\u2019t want you worried that when I\u2019m taking a vote, making a decision, writing a bill, looking at an amendment, that I\u2019m listening to anyone but you, the people that I want to serve and that I want to represent.\" Nobody seeking federal office can legally accept direct corporate or union donations, the Federal Election Commission notes. Yet political action committees--open to anyone\u2019s contributions or founded and run by individuals working for corporations or affiliated with labor unions, membership organizations or trade associations--routinely fuel campaigns. In the 2016 elections, PACs gave $472.7 million to congressional candidates, according to the campaign finance tracking website OpenSecrets.org run by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. According to the site, PAC donations accounted for 35 percent of campaign funds for House Democrats, 39 percent for House Republicans, 15 percent for Senate Democrats and 27 percent for Senate Republicans. O\u2019Rourke amends We inquired into the basis of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s claim to near-uniqueness for not taking PAC money. By email, O\u2019Rourke replied that he\u2019d revise what he saysgoing forward. \"What I should have said,\" O\u2019Rourke said, \"is that there are only two members of Congress who do not take PAC money and who also do not have a leadership PAC (which gives PAC contributions to other members), myself and Ro Khanna,\" a California Democrat. In a March 2017 press release, Khanna said he and O\u2019Rourke had introduced legislation barring members of Congress and aspirants from accepting PAC donations. That releasegrouped Khanna and O\u2019Rourke among six House members who didn\u2019t accept PAC donations in the run-up to the 2016 elections. That count was based, the release said, on a December 2016 breakdown of candidate finance filings posted by Colorado-based CleanSlateNow, which focuses onchanging how campaigns are funded. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s reply to us included a different count attributed to information on the OpenSecrets site. O\u2019Rourke wrote: \"There are four members of Congress (based on the Open Secrets website) who did not take PAC money in the last cycle (either to their Congressional campaign or to their leadership PAC if they had one) -- myself, Ro Khanna, John Sarbanes and Francis Rooney. Both Sarbanes and Rooney have PACs themselves that make PAC contributions to other candidates.\" Reviewing web posts and records Information on the OpenSecrets site indicates that into May 2017, Cruz had raised more than $1.9 million from PACs with the contributions accounting for 2 percent of more than $117 million he\u2019d raised starting from his 2012 election to the Senate. The comparable entry for O\u2019Rourke doesn\u2019t show a zero for his PAC donations. It indicates instead $297,969 in PAC contributions to O\u2019Rourke campaigns, amounting to 5 percent of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s $6.3 million in contributions since 2011, the year before his initial election to the House. We asked O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign about the tallied PAC contributions. A senior adviser, David Wysong, said by phone that O\u2019Rourke accepted such donations through his first couple of House elections but stopped doing so before seeking his third term in 2016. By email, Wysong provided a document he described as a February 2015 form letter from O\u2019Rourke to possible PAC contributors after which, Wysong said, O\u2019Rourke accepted no PAC donations. From O\u2019Rourke\u2019s letter: \"Starting with this election cycle, I plan to no longer accept PAC contributions. I've made this decision in an effort to focus more of my campaign efforts on bringing new, smaller and local donors into the campaign.\" Wysong also emailed an example of O'Rourke turning back such such aid--an October 2016 letter from O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign manager, Brianna Carmen, returning a donation from the Treasury Employees PAC. Wysong noted too that according to an FEC summary page about O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate finance report filed in July 2017, the candidate raised more than $2 million from April through June 2017, none of that from PACs. Banana peels With help from the center\u2019s research director, Sarah Bryner, we confirmed from the OpenSecrets site and FEC filings that O\u2019Rourke did not bank any PAC contributions as he sought re-election in 2016 or in the first months of his Senate bid. But this proved a slog to confirm because PAC names repeatedly appear in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s contribution reports. His July 2017 filingwith the FEC separately shows $14,580 in contributions from other candidate committees. How unique? Our first focus was on gauging the accuracy of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s claim to being one of two members not accepting PAC aid. After identifying each current senator and House member on the U.S. Congress website,we checked the OpenSecrets site for PAC contributions to each member; the site provides a summary page for each member showing her or his contributions by cycle and over the years. Candidate contributions are further broken down by categories including individual contributions, PAC contributions and self-financing. Here\u2019s the site\u2019s entry for O\u2019Rourke covering the 2016 election cycle: SOURCE: Summary for Beto O\u2019Rourke, OpenSecrets.org (accessed May 10, 2017) From OpenSecrets posts, we identified five House members who did not get PAC contributions before the 2016 elections: O\u2019Rourke; Khanna; Sarbanes, D-Md.; Jared Polis, D-Colo; Rooney, R-Fla--with Polis, Khanna and Rooney also fielding no PAC aid in their House careers. A conflict we didn't settle: CleanSlateNow previously identified Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., as not getting PAC help in his 2016 re-election bid. In contrast, Roe\u2019s OpenSecrets summary page for Roe indicates he got $6,000 in PAC donations before that election. Next, we eyeballed FEC-posted information, focusing on campaign filings by House members\u2019 principal campaign committees for 2015-16. These recordsconfirmed Khanna did not get PAC contributions that cycle. Otherwise, the records showed, Rooney received a $10,296 PAC contribution from Rooney Victory on Dec. 30, 2016; Sarbanes received donations from the VoteSANE PAC; and Polis logged contributions attributed to JStreetPAC, AmeriPAC and ActBlue. Similarly, our FEC search suggested that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign in 2015-16 received $110,721 attributed to PACs (including ActBlue, JStreetPAC and the New Democrat Coalition PAC). Of this total, $74,400 in contributions were designated for the 2018 Democratic primary. So, candidates including O'Rourke took PAC aid? Not so, we found, in that the donations were almost uniformly made by individuals whose personal contribution were routed through supportive \"conduit\" PACs--a phrase we hadn\u2019t heard before. It looked to us like the donation to Rooney came from a committee devoted to his candidacy. On the FEC site, the respective 2016 donations marked as \"PAC\" to Sarbanes, O\u2019Rourke and Polis were each accompanied by a column describing the donations as a \"conduit total,\" with a note stating the donation was \"earmarked through this organization.\" We sought more information about ActBlue, the largest aggregator of individual contributions among the PACs linked to O\u2019Rourke. The group says on its web site that it offers tools to help Democratic candidates but it\u2019s not a traditional PAC that rounds up donations and obscures specific donors. ActBlue says it \"acts as a conduit federally and in most states, which means we provide the infrastructure for campaigns and organizations to fundraise online, but we don\u2019t fundraise on behalf of anyone.

A few days later, the chart indicated $43,740 in PAC donations. Red flags? Negative, Bryner told us, saying the charts summarizing O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate contributions were erroneous and would be rectified. Significantly, Bryner also showed us how to query anFEC site that provides detailed files about all candidates, parties and other political committees. From the site, we fetched a July 23, 2017 commission list itemizing more than 45,000 PAC contributions to congressional candidates in the 2017-18 election cycle. That list showed no PAC contributions to O\u2019Rourke. Experts concur We asked campaign finance experts to guide us to documentation distinguishing donations through conduit PACs from traditional PAC contributions. Judith Ingram, press officer at the FEC, showed us that in quarterly filings,ActBlue donations present an individual nameas a line item below each listing of ActBlueas a donor, along with a text field that explains the individual donation is part of a conduit total. Ingram further confirmed that the JStreet PAC contributions reported by O\u2019Rourke were made by individual donors employing the PAC as a conduit. Stephen Spaulding, chief of strategy at the nonpartisan watchdog group Common Cause, echoed Ingram\u2019s comments--that groups such as ActBlue act as intermediaries by processing payments that \"can be attributed to an actual donor, a human being.\" If a donation was a traditional PAC contribution, Spaulding explained, the listed contributor would be the PAC alone, and there wouldn\u2019t be a specific individual\u2019s name linked to it."

    "claim": "Says 70 percent of benefits in Donald Trump\u2019s proposal for child care \"go to the people making over $100,000 a year.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The claim that 70 percent of benefits in Donald Trump's proposal for child care go to people making over $100,000 a year is true based on the evidence provided. The Tax Policy Center study found that Trump's plan relies on tax deductions, which are worth more per dollar for higher income families due to their higher marginal tax rates. This means that lower-income families may spend less on child care and receive less benefit from Trump's proposed tax credits.\n\nAccording to the study, families making between $100,000-$200,000 per year would see an average jump of $360 in after-tax income due to Trump's plan. In contrast, families with an income below $40,000 per year might see an increase of $20 or less. These findings suggest that the majority of benefits from Trump's proposal do go to higher income brackets.\n\nAdditionally, the report notes that lower-income families are less likely to place money into Trump's proposed savings accounts due to lower levels of financial liquidity. This further supports the conclusion that the benefits of Trump's proposal disproportionately benefit higher income brackets.\n\nWhile it is possible that future versions of Trump's policy may have a different distributional impact, based on the evidence provided, it appears that his current proposal does indeed favor higher income families more than lower-income ones. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she cannot jump on board with President Donald Trump\u2019s child care proposals because they won\u2019t actually help the poorest Americans. On CNN\u2019s State of the Union, moderator Jake Tapper said, \"In a speech to a joint session of Congress, President Trump renewed his commitment to child care and paid family leave ... Paid family leave, a big Democratic priority for a long time, is that something you could work with the president on?\" Pelosi said, \"The first conversation I had with him after the election, that week of the election, we talked about that subject, and a subject that his family is interested in as well. But what he has proposed is something that benefits -- 70 percent of the benefits go to people making over $100,000 a year.\" We decided to check out Pelosi\u2019s claim. It\u2019s important to note she is not referring to the estimated benefits of paid family leave, but the monetary benefits of Trump\u2019s child care tax proposals. Trump has made no formal attempts to advance his paid family leave policy yet, although both Democratic and Republican senators introduced two different bills on this general issue. So all we have is an analysis of his proposal from the campaign. Trump\u2019s proposal includes six weeks of paid maternity leave if no policy is offered by an employer; tax deductions for child care expenses up to age 13, capped at the average cost of childcare per state; a refundable tax credit for child care costs for lower-income families; and expanding tax-free savings accounts for childcare and school tuition. The Tax Policy Center, run by the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, released its study of Trump\u2019s child care plan Feb. 28, a few days before Pelosi\u2019s interview. Pelosi\u2019s spokesman confirmed she was citing this report on during her CNN interview. The Tax Policy Center study found that 70 percent of total tax benefits would go to families earning more than $100,000. The reason? Trump\u2019s plan relies on tax deductions, which are worth more per dollar for higher income families. That\u2019s because families with higher incomes face higher marginal tax rates. Lower-income families may spend less on child care because they often rely on informal, low-cost arrangements. Chye-Ching Huang, one of the study\u2019s co-authors and deputy director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in an email, \"The estimate that 70 percent of the benefits go to those with incomes over $100,000 is conservative -- the share going to those with incomes over $100,000 could very well be higher.\" Analysts looked at three new tax benefits related to child care proposed by his campaign: the deduction for child care expenses, a refundable credit aimed at low-income families without stay-at-home parents, and the expansion of tax-free savings accounts. According to their report, Trump\u2019s plan would increase the average after-tax income for families by about $190 in 2017. Those with an income below $40,000 per year might see an increase of $20 or less. Families making between $100,000-$200,000 per year might see an average jump of $360. Further, they say Trump\u2019s proposed tax credit for lower-income families is worth less than the deduction. Taxpayers who claim the credit would benefit by up to 7.7 cents per dollar spent on child care. Those claiming the deduction may receive between 10 and 39.6 cents per dollar spent on child care. Lower income families are also less likely to place money into Trump\u2019s proposed savings accounts due to lower levels of financial liquidity. In sum, then, the report finds that Trump\u2019s current family leave policy is regressive, helping families in higher income brackets more than those in lower-income ones. Alan Cole, an economist from the Tax Foundation, said that he agreed with the distribution tables from the Tax Policy Center\u2019s report. \"The only caveat I'd add is that campaign proposals like this one tend to be refined and revamped after people take office,\" he said. \"I could easily see the next version of the policy having a different distributional impact.\" The White House did not respond to a request for comment."

Therefore, based on the evidence provided, the claim that \"Collectively states are spending more on Medicaid than they do on K-12 education\" is supported by the data.",
    "doc": "House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, is urging lawmakers to make Medicaid more flexible, effective and cheaper for states to run.\"Under the Medicaid system the rules are set in Washington, but much of the bills are paid in our state capitals,\" he said during his Feb. 5 \"Make Life Work\" speech at a conservative think tank in Washington \"Collectively states are spending more on Medicaid than they do on K-12 education.\"We looked into the claim that states are paying more for Medicaid than public education. Cantor\u2019s staff told us the information came from a report, published by the National Association of State Budget Officers last fall, that tallied where states get and spend their money.The study found that states planned to spend a total $1.7 trillion in fiscal 2012. Of the sum, 39.8 percent would come from general fund moneys that are collected through statewide taxes, 31.2 percent from federal grants and the remaining 29 percent from other state funds and bonds.Medicaid, which provides health care for the poor, was expected to be the most expensive item in the collective state budgets. States were projected to spend $406 billion on the service, or 23.9 percent of their total budgets. Elementary and secondary education came in second, drawing $336 billion, or 19.8 percent of total expenses.But there\u2019s a catch to these figures: The federal government provides states with about 56 percent of what they spend on Medicaid, according to NASBO report. So Cantor is including as state expenses about $228 billion that Uncle Sam sends to the states for Medicaid.The picture changes if we simply examine the portions of Medicaid and public education that states pay out of their general funds. Public schools rise to the top of the expense list, drawing an expected $235 billion last fiscal year, or 34.7 percent of all general fund spending. Medicaid falls to a distant No. 2, receiving an estimated $133 billion, or 19.6 percent of general fund outlays.Experts we spoke to didn\u2019t express a preference for one accounting method or the other.\"We include both methods in our report,\" said Stacy Mazer, senior staff associate at NASBO. \"One reason we\u2019ve been using total funds is that some states define their funds differently. And one of the other issues is that even though it\u2019s not all your money, you\u2019re still administering it.\"Tracy Gordon, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said most health care industry analysts use a total figure cited by Cantor, but note that it includes federal dollars.Arturo Perez, a fiscal analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures, said his organization tracks states\u2019 general fund spending and considers K-12 education to be the greatest recipient of state money."

Policyholders were able to renew their existing policies early, thereby retaining their access to the same doctors and hospitals.",
    "doc": "It\u2019s been four years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, but the right and left are still exchanging jabs over the perceived benefits or harm of the health care law. And there\u2019s plenty of misinformation to go around. This time, it was a radio ad released Dec. 10 by the National Republican Congressional Committee that called out Rep. Carol Shea-Porter (D-N.H) for her support of law. The ad introduces an unnamed family whose insurance plan was canceled, and the sick husband can\u2019t go to his doctors because their new plan doesn\u2019t offer access to the same doctors and hospitals. Shea-Porter swiftly called the ad false in a statement to media. \"Washington Republicans should take down their misleading attack ads and stop frightening Granite Staters who hold individual policies from Anthem, because they can indeed renew their policies and keep their current doctors and hospitals,\" she said. The statement went on to say that the congresswoman had already worked with Anthem representatives to extend the company\u2019s renewal deadline for individual policyholders so they\u2019d have access to same network in 2014. Shea-Porter also repeated the comment about individuals having access to the same doctors and hospitals next year in a press release a few days later. We\u2019ve checked several versions of the \"if you like your policy, you can keep it\" statement from a variety of sources. But we wondered whether individual policyholders in New Hampshire would have access to the same doctors and hospitals next year, especially in light of an Anthem announcement in September that individuals on the state\u2019s new marketplace would have access to only 16 of the state\u2019s 26 hospitals. A Brief Background President Obama promised many times when promoting his new health care law that policyholders who liked their insurance plans wouldn\u2019t have to change. Old plans were supposed to be protected through a system called grandfathering, basically allowing plans to continue as long as they met certain requirements. Those rules were so strict, though, that very few plans could meet them. And so Obama\u2019s promise came back to bite him when an estimated 4 million cancellation letters went out earlier this fall. For damage control, in November the White House announced that insurance providers and state insurance commissioners could extend current plans, even if they didn\u2019t meet the minimum requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The situation in New Hampshire In the following weeks, New Hampshire Insurance Commissioner Roger Sevigny was one of several state commissioners who said the state would allow renewal of non-compliant plans. But for Granite Staters with individually purchased insurance plans, renewal was already an option. Under New Hampshire law, policyholders are allowed to renew an existing policy earlier than its anniversary date. Anthem publicized this option in a release the day after Obama\u2019s announcement, saying the company had sent notices to individual policyholders to remind them of this choice. \"We wanted to underscore that our previously announced early renewal option, which has proven to be very popular among our members, already gives individual policyholders who wish to keep their existing policy a way to do so,\" Lisa Guertin, president of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield in New Hampshire, said in the release. Anthem is by far the predominant insurance company in New Hampshire. It\u2019s the only company participating in the state\u2019s marketplace in 2014 and holds about 30,000 individual policies in the state. Other companies hold around 1,000, according to the N.H. Insurance Department. The NRCC ad that Shea-Porter was responding to said that one-third of the state\u2019s hospitals weren\u2019t covered under the Affordable Care Act. That\u2019s true in a sense -- Anthem\u2019s individual plans for sale on the state\u2019s new insurance marketplace offer a \"narrow network\" that excludes 10 of the state\u2019s 26 hospitals. Yet a company spokesman confirmed that those who renewed their existing plans before the deadline would have access to the same network of providers, including those 10 hospitals, for 12 more months. At the end of November, the insurance company extended its deadline for the early renewal option for a second time, giving policyholders until Dec. 16 to renew their canceled plans. That would have given them a policy year of Dec. 1, 2013, to Nov. 30, 2014."

The article states that during Cicilline's administration, the city made its annual required contribution (ARC) every year, with one exception (p. 2). This suggests that the city was consistently contributing to the pension fund at a level of 100%, with only a brief period where the contribution fell below this threshold.\n2. The article also states that during Cicilline's tenure as mayor, the city made its ARC at a rate of 100% or higher for most years (p. 3). While there was a brief period where the contribution fell below 100%, the city generally met or exceeded this threshold throughout Cicilline's administration.\n3. The article notes that during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, the city's pension contribution was only 96% (p. 4). However, this is an exception to the general trend of the city making its ARC at 100% or higher.\n4. The article concludes that during Cicilline's administration, the city's pension contributions were made at 100% or within just a few percentage points for most years (p. 5).

    "doc": "On the Christmas Day edition of WPRI\u2019s \"Newsmakers,\" talk turned to the public employee pension problems in Rhode Island. Former Providence Mayor and now U.S. Rep. David Cicilline was asked how often his administration properly funded the city's pension system.Cicilline initially said the city made its annual required contribution (ARC) -- the amount that experts say is needed to properly fund that system -- every year during his eight years as mayor. But then he backed off a bit, not always finishing his sentences.\"We made it every year and I think the last year . . . One thing that we set out [to do] -- we had a plan that made sure we made 100-percent contribution to the system to keep us current, which doesn't deal with the unfunded liability but it stops the bleeding,\" he said. \"I think with the exception of the last year or maybe the last two years, we were at 100 percent. I think the last year it was 90 . . .\"At that point, WPRI reporter Tim White broke in and asked, \"You're saying you made the ARC six times in your administration?\"\"Yeah, I think to the 100 percent,\" Cicilline said. \"I think two years we got over 90 but didn't . . . But the unfunded liability occurred because -- and this happened in Providence for many years before I took office -- that the city didn't make its 100-percent contribution.\"Since he left the mayor's office, Cicilline has come under a lot of fire over how he managed the city's finances, so we decided to check his statement.We turned to the latest report by Buck Consultants, which determines how much Providence is supposed to put into its pension program each year. The report also lists how much the city was supposed to invest each year and how much it actually did.The report goes back to the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, when the city invested all of the $16.1 million that it was supposed to. But in following years, the contribution started to fall. With Vincent \"Buddy\" Cianci Jr. in his second era as mayor, the level dropped to 93.6 percent, then 57.5 percent, then lower still. During Cianci's last year in office -- 2002 -- it was 64.2 percent.Cicilline is correct when he says that the contribution level rose after he took over from acting Mayor John Lombardi. During the 2003 fiscal year -- when Cicilline had been at the helm for only six months -- the contribution rate rose to 80.1 percent.The amount kept rising, but the contribution level didn't hit or exceed 100 percent until the 2007 fiscal year, more than three years after he took office.Over the subsequent three years it averaged 100 percent -- 100.2 percent in 2007, 100 percent in 2008 and 99.8 percent in 2009 -- but then dipped a bit to 97.7 percent. By then, the price tag for financing the city's employee pension program had grown to $50.3 million, more than three times what it was in 1996. When we asked Cicilline's office about his statement, spokeswoman Raymonde Charles said that \"as it turns out, his recollection wasn't that far off.\"With the exception of two of the budgets proposed and implemented during his administration, the city's pension contributions were made at 100 percent or within just a few percentage points, and in one year, even in excess of 100 percent.\"But that wasn't the question. The question was how many times the Cicilline administration funded the pensions at 100 percent. And particularly during the 2004-2006 fiscal years, where the payment was at 96 percent or less, the shortfall was $2 million to $6 million.At the end of the 2010 fiscal year, Providence's pension fund had only 34 percent of the $1.26 billion it needed, according to the report."

    "doc": "A Texas legislator who says she asks U.S. Muslims if they renounce terrorism prompted a viral firestorm online with a Facebook post.

In her Feb. 3, 2015, web post, \"My Response to the Critics,\" state Rep. Molly White, R-Belton, said her Facebook statement posted Jan. 29, 2015 as Muslims came to the Capitol was misconstrued \"into something intolerant, bigoted and anti-American.\" Here\u2019s her original Facebook post, as later highlighted by the Texas Tribune: In her February follow-up, White wrote: \"As a legislator who has the responsibility to look out for and protect the safety as well as liberties of my constituents and all Texans, it remains my duty to stay vigilant and inform the public about maintaining our rule of law and protecting our 1st Amendment freedoms.\" \"First,\" she wrote, \"the genesis of my statement occurred when the organization CAIR was brought to my attention. CAIR, Council on American-Islamic Relations, started Muslim Day at the Texas Capitol in 2003.\" Sarwat Husain, a council leader from San Antonio, told us by email the day at the Capitol was started by Texas Muslim groups including the council, which took charge of the gathering starting in 2011. \"Second,\" White\u2019s response said, \"it is worth noting that CAIR was recently listed as one of 82 organizations designated as a terrorist group by the United Arab Emirates. That\u2019s right, an Islamic country listed the organization that hosts Muslim Day in Texas as one of 82 terrorist organizations.\" For real? Legislator cites news story White\u2019s response included a web link to a November 2014 Fox News story stating the UAE, a tiny oil-rich federation on the Arabian Peninsula, had just designated CAIR a terrorist group on a list including extremists such as the Islamic State and Al Nusra, Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria. The story also quoted the council calling on the UAE to remove CAIR, the Muslim American Society and other \"civil society organizations\" from the list, saying its own inclusion was a \"bizarre move.\" The council, headquartered on Capitol Hill, says it was founded in 1994 to challenge stereotypes of Islam and Muslims. Its Houston-based Texas chapter was founded in 2002. Advocating terrorism isn\u2019t a declared activity. The council says on its website: \"CAIR believes that Muslims worldwide must offer themselves as personal examples of the Islamic values of compassion, tolerance and moderation. We encourage members of the American Muslim community to work in public service.\" Also: \"We have a well-established, very public record of denouncing terrorism and religious intolerance.\" Council listed as terrorist group In contrast, the UAE named the council a terrorist organization in November 2014. Online, we spotted a full government-issued list of more than 80 groups, including al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, al Shabab and Boko Haram--and CAIR. A Nov. 20, 2014, news story on GulfNews.com said the list designating terrorist organizations around the world had been issued by the government\u2019s cabinet Nov. 15, 2014, in line with an anti-terror law issued in August 2014 by the nation\u2019s president, Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Under the law, the story said, any individual or group that even communicates with a group on the list commits an offense. The story said the list would be reviewed by the government at least once a year. According to the story, Anwar Mohammad Gargash, a government minister, said most objections were from groups tied to the Muslim Brotherhood and \"many of them have engaged in incitement and the creation of an atmosphere of extremism.\" CAIR was not singled out. As PolitiFact noted in 2013, the Brotherhood is an Islamic political and social movement founded in Egypt nearly 90 years ago that has millions of members throughout the Middle East. In Egypt and other countries, the Brotherhood has frequently been oppressed. After Hosni Mubarak was ousted from the Egyptian presidency in 2011, the group was legalized. But the year after Mohamed Morsi, the Brotherhood\u2019s candidate for president, won election in 2012, he was overthrown in a military coup and arrested. In an interview with Fox News posted online Nov. 21, 2014, UAE\u2019s foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, was asked why its list included the council and the U.S.-based Muslim American Society, which expressed shock at its inclusion. The minister replied: \"Our threshold is quite low when we talk about extremism. We cannot accept incitement or funding when we look at some of these organizations. I mean, for many countries, the definition of terror is that you have to carry a weapon and terrorize people. For us, it\u2019s far beyond that. We cannot tolerate even the smallest and the tiniest amount of terrorism.\" He did not offer specifics (nor was he asked to do so). On Nov. 17, 2014, foreign-affairs reporter Adam Taylor said in a Washington Post news blog post that a significant number of the \"more surprising inclusions on the list appear to have ties to\" the Muslim Brotherhood: \"The Muslim American Society, for instance, was founded by Muslim Brotherhood members in the 1990s. Rumors about links to the Muslim Brotherhood have also dogged CAIR,\" Taylor wrote. We contacted the council. National spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said the council has no connection to the Muslim Brotherhood. Asked about the UAE minister\u2019s statement, Hooper emailed: \"We are one of the nation's most vocal advocates for constitutionally-protected civil liberties. That is hardly \u2018incitement.\u2019 And we do not \u2018fund\u2019 anyone.\" State Department doubts Hooper further pointed out C-SPAN video of a State Department spokesman, Jeff Rathke, saying Nov. 18, 2014: \"The United States does not consider these U.S. organizations to be terrorist organizations,\" going on to specify the council and Muslim American Society by name. Rathke also said the government was asking the UAE for more information. (See the State Department transcript here.) The council doesn\u2019t appear on the State Department\u2019s list of designated terrorist organizations. Another council official, Corey Saylor, suggested by email that many groups did not belong on the UAE list. Other analyses A Nov. 25, 2014, news story in the Daily Mail, a British newspaper, quoted experts including Frederic Wehrey at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace saying that by listing groups like the council, Islamic Relief UK and some of the largest Muslim associations in Finland, Norway, Sweden and other European countries, \"the UAE is pushing its view that the fight against militant Islamism is as much an ideological war as a conventional one. The real target of the list,\" Wehrey said, is \"politically active Islamism.\" Wehry went on: \"(The UAE) is trying to include non-violent, Brotherhood-affiliated groups in the same ideological constellation as real terrorist groups like (Nigeria's) Boko Haram and Al-Qaeda,\" he said. Andrew Hammond, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations' Middle East and North Africa program, said: \"I think the criteria (for the list) has been to look at anything that could have even a remote link to the Muslim Brotherhood.\" More recently, according to a Jan. 17, 2015, news story on ArabianBusiness.com, the UAE has agreed to allow groups to appeal listing decisions to the government\u2019s Ministry of Justice; the story said Jenifer Wicks, the council\u2019s civil rights litigation director, had recently \"submitted documents seeking to appeal the designation.\" Unindicted co-conspirators? Next, we asked Hooper and Saylor about CAIR in 2007 being named among 300 others as an unindicted co-conspirator in a U.S. case regarding funding to the extremist group Hamas, as Fox News said in the news story noted by White. Saylor said the council was identified that way along with other groups with interests in Muslim or Palestinian issues. In October 2010, Saylor said, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the government had violated the Fifth Amendment rights of another group named as an unindicted co-conspirator \u2014 and by implication the council and other groups, Saylor said. The court, saying the government inappropriately failed to file the list \"under seal,\" also said inclusion on the list was the result of \"simply an untested allegation of the government made in anticipation of a possible evidentiary dispute that never came to pass.\" In March 2011, the Washington Post noted a federal judge, Jorge A. Solis, denied the council\u2019s request to be stricken from the list of unindicted co-conspirators. Regardless, the story said, the council had never been charged with criminal activity. Reporter Glenn Kessler summed up: \"The repeated references to CAIR being an \u2018unindicted co-conspirator\u2019 is one of those true facts that ultimately gives a false impression.\" Footnote: White\u2019s February response also noted a Texas Tribune news story revealing her concern that one of CAIR\u2019s Texas leaders, Mustafa Carroll, said at a Capitol rally in 2013 that practicing Muslims \"are above the law of the land.\" White\u2019s quotation of Carroll was incomplete, the Tribune said, in that Carroll had prefaced his comment by saying: \"Following the law of the land is part of Sharia. And we follow the law of the land.\" Carroll told the Tribune that by saying Muslims were \"above the law,\" he meant practicing Muslims should \"behave in a way that would put them above any possibility of breaking the law.\""

    "doc": "Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican U.S. Rep.

George LeMieux claimed he was a California resident who lives with his wife, U.S. Rep. Mary Bono Mack. We rated that Mostly False.Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin elaborated on Nelson\u2019s comments after the debate, saying what Nelson meant is that \"Mack is part of a family unit that has two homestead exemptions.\" He pointed to Florida\u2019s Constitution, which says, \"Not more than one exemption shall be allowed any individual or family unit or with respect to any residential unit.\"Some quick background: Mack was first elected to Congress in 2004; he filed for divorce from his wife Ann in 2005; and two years later, he married U.S. Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif., the widow of singer and U.S. Rep. Sonny Bono.When Mack announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate in 2011, the Tampa Bay Times wrote that he had been criticized for not spending time in Florida. According to the story, \"Mack said he and his wife spend time together in Washington and then usually go separate ways on the weekend \u2014 the opposite situation from other lawmakers. Another incentive to be in Florida, he said: an 11-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son from his first marriage are in the state.\"The U.S. Constitution requires Senate candidates to be a citizen of the U.S. for at least nine years and a resident of the state when elected. Florida\u2019s election code doesn\u2019t define residency, but the courts have defined legal residence to mean a permanent residence, according to a 1993 advisory opinion by the state Division of Elections.Mack gets a homestead exemption for a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom condo in Fort Myers, Lee County property records show. His time at the home has been questioned by political opponents and also by his ex-wife, who said in a 2005 divorce court filing that Mack bought it to \"solely to assist his political career\" when he was running in the congressional district for the area. The Mack campaign has disputed her account.The Tampa Tribune raised more questions in February 2012, reporting that Mack\u2019s current wife gets an exemption on her California home on top of Mack\u2019s homestead break for his condo. The Tribune quoted William D. Shepherd, general counsel for the Hillsborough County property appraiser\u2019s office, as saying the Macks should not collect two homestead exemptions because they are operating as a \"family unit,\" and Florida law says one homestead exemption per unit.Under Florida law, Mack is entitled to the exemption if he can prove his finances aren\u2019t co-mingled with those of his wife.Mack campaign spokesman David James told the Miami Herald in February that Mack meets that criteria: \"They file separate returns, do not have joint accounts, and Connie\u2019s name is not on Mary\u2019s home in California, and Mary\u2019s is not on Connie\u2019s home in Fort Myers,\" James said.Lee County Property Appraiser Ken Wilkinson looked into the legality of Mack\u2019s homestead after the media attention about it. His verdict: \"Connie is entitled to the homestead here.\"\"He provided the documentation, and our attorneys looked at it, and it is proper,\" Wilkinson told PolitiFact Florida in an interview.Wilkinson said he could not get into specifics about Mack\u2019s case, but he emphasized that Mack had to clear \"very stringent hoops\" to get the homestead after the review \"or I would not have agreed.\"Further, he said he does not think the intent of homestead laws is to prevent members of Congress from getting married. If Connie Mack or Mary Bono Mack had to give up their homesteads, they may be at risk of losing the residency requirement for Congress.James said Nelson can\u2019t back up his debate claim.\"The Lee County assessor has approved Connie Mack's one and only homestead in Fort Myers, the only home he owns,\" James wrote in a statement after the debate.Shepherd said he still disagrees with Mack receiving the exemption. Shepherd told PolitiFact Florida that case law has changed on this even within the past year. \"In Hillsborough, they would have to give up one of those homesteads,\" he said."

Therefore, the label False is appropriate.",
    "doc": "It\u2019s an alarming contention: The Austin City Council is poised to \"give\" more than $1 billion to a private company and receive nothing in return as it seeks to lure a Major League Soccer team. The anti-stadium political action committee making the claim of a \"$1 billion giveaway\" \u2014 called Austin for a Better Future \u2014 drives home the enormity of the sum in an internet video by conjuring a wish list of alternative uses for the money. By Wednesday afternoon, the video had been viewed more than 20,000 times. \"Imagine what else we could do with another billion dollars to make our city even better,\" intones the video\u2019s youthful-looking narrator. He raises the prospect of using the money to instead fund annual pay raises for Austin school teachers, \"full-ride scholarships\" to the University of Texas for every local high school graduate, or newly built homes \"for every single homeless person in the city of Austin.\" Setting aside that no formal proposals exist to spend $1 billion on any of those items, we were curious whether it\u2019s accurate to say the City Council will be handing such an amount to a private company and getting nothing in return if it approves the agreement for the soccer stadium as it currently is formulated? A representative of the anti-stadium group contacted by PolitiFact Texas said the $1 billion figure is based on simple math and actually is conservative. But two professors who study publicly funded economic incentives said the group\u2019s analysis is off base, with one calling the $1 billion amount that the group came up with \"crazy\" and the other saying it \"doesn\u2019t pass the sniff test.\" Under the stadium proposal \u2014 on which the City Council is slated to take some key initial votes Thursday \u2014 the city-owned McKalla Place tract near the Domain in North Austin would be leased to Precourt Sports Ventures for $1 a year. Precourt, a Major League Soccer team owner, would then privately finance and build what it has estimated would be a $200 million stadium at the site. The city would own the land and the stadium, so Precourt wouldn\u2019t pay any property taxes on the facility. The initial lease would last for 20 years, with three options for Precourt to renew it under the same terms. The anti-stadium group, which initially answered questions from PolitiFact Texas through e-mail but didn\u2019t respond to a follow-up request for a phone interview, said it arrived at the \"$1 billion giveaway\" figure by first calculating the estimated property taxes that would be owed by Precourt if it owned the land, instead of leasing it from the city, and also made $250 million worth of improvements on it, which the anti-stadium group pegged as the value of the soccer stadium. The group then took that figure, based on 2017 property tax rates, and multiplied it by 80 years \u2014 the maximum term of the proposed lease, assuming all options were exercised. It also assumed 2.5 percent annual growth in local property values, arriving at its $1 billion-plus total. But Clint Peinhardt, a University of Texas at Dallas political science professor, said such an analysis has many holes, not the least of which is that 80 years is simply too long a time period to forecast accurately. Who knows, for instance, if soccer will even be played in 80 years, or if it will become so huge in the United States that it tops football in terms of a loyal fan base. What\u2019s more, the anti-stadium group\u2019s analysis doesn\u2019t factor in depreciation, which would have a major impact on the value of the facility and the tax calculation. Or the possibility that the lease would not be renewed by the soccer team\u2019s ownership. Or the potential for something even more outlandish \u2014 such as a meteor destroying the site and rendering the entire exercise moot. \"Anything that far out in the future \u2014 80 years \u2014 is a pretty crazy thing to try to guess,\" Peinhardt said. \"In general, that is just a huge time frame.\" As a result, Peinhardt and Nathan Jensen, a University of Texas at Austin professor of government, said it\u2019s too much of a leap of logic to simply add up the value of property taxes that wouldn\u2019t be due for decades and then contend city leaders are \"giving them away\" in the present if they approve the stadium plan. They said the \"time value of money\" \u2014 whereby a dollar today is worth much more than a theoretical dollar in the future \u2014 just doesn\u2019t work that way. The pair also noted that the anti-stadium group\u2019s analysis assumes no benefits to the city \u2014 in terms of jobs, tourism or nearby development \u2014 to offset the purported $1 billion cost to taxpayers. While taxpayer incentives for a soccer stadium might not be the most \"revenue-maximizing\" path for the city to choose for the McKalla site \u2014 particularly since other plans recently have been proposed for the tract \u2014 they said the potential positives should be considered along with the negatives. There is also the detail that, as currently proposed, the city would still own the stadium outright if the team\u2019s ownership didn\u2019t renew the deal. Jensen described himself as a critic of the current stadium plan, but he nonetheless dismissed the anti-stadium group\u2019s number, saying it isn\u2019t \"a credible calculation\" or a serious fiscal analysis."

The label \"Conflicting\" accurately reflects the uncertainty and ambiguity surrounding these claims.",
    "doc": "Charlie Crist has upped the ante on one of his favorite talking points: attacking Gov. Rick Scott for K-12 education cuts. In a Crist TV ad praising public school teachers, the narrator says: \"They don\u2019t fly in private jets or float on fancy yachts, but the job Florida teachers do couldn\u2019t be more valuable. And when Rick Scott cut education by over a billion dollars, thousands of them lost their jobs, class sizes went up, our kids paid the price.\" A visual shows a 2014 Miami Herald article that cited a $1.3 billion cut to public schools. \"Why did he do it?\" the ad continues. \"To pay for millions in handouts to big corporations. Tax cuts here, budget cuts there. Thousands of teaching jobs gone.\" The ad gives no indication of when those education cuts took place, but the answer is that the $1.3 billion K-12 cut came in 2011. We have already fact-checked whether Scott cut education to pay for tax breaks; we rated it Half True. Here, we will fact-check the allegation about the consequences of the budget cut. Did thousands of teachers lose their jobs? Did class sizes go up? Teacher layoffs amid budget cuts Scott entered office in 2011 facing a $3.6 billion shortfall in the state\u2019s $70.5 billion budget. His first budget proposal, released at a tea party rally, included steep spending cuts, including reductions in education spending. After a contentious session, the Legislature passed -- and Scott signed -- a budget that included $1.3 billion in cuts to education. The reduction ended up being about $540 per student, working out to a 7.9 percent cut in funding. (We\u2019ve broken down some of those dollar figures before.) After he faced a backlash over the cuts, Scott went on in subsequent years to back increases to K-12 education, though his high point for per-pupil spending still lags behind the high-water mark under Crist. So did \"thousands\" of teachers lose their jobs as a result of the 2011 budget cuts? We found no definitive source that shows the precise number of teacher layoffs statewide. The Crist campaign points to layoffs in a single school district: Broward. The campaign cites a June 2012 Sun-Sentinel article that stated that the district \"eliminated about 1,500 teachers\" in 2011 -- but then was poised to add 678 positions in 2012. So that figure falls short of the \"thousands\" cited by the campaign. A spokeswoman for Broward schools told PolitiFact that in June 2011, a total of 1,431 annual and probationary teachers were not reappointed, but 583 were later rehired. Additionally, 117 teachers were placed on a layoff list, but 97 were rehired. That brings the total to 868 in Broward. A caveat about Broward: State budget cuts are not the only reason for the district\u2019s budget woes. A major factor was that the county faced rapid enrollment growth followed by a decline. Though the Crist campaign only cited an article about layoffs in a single district, layoffs occurred in other counties, too, including 315 teachers in Pasco County. (In Miami-Dade, nearly all of the teachers kept their jobs, except for some temporary teachers who received poor performance reviews.) School districts report to the state Department of Education the number of teachers they have each year. That data shows that the number of teachers between the fall of 2010 and the fall of 2011 declined by 1,405, or about 1 percent. This came as the number of students was increasing by about 24,000 between the 2010-11 school year and the 2011-12 school year. By the fall of 2012, the number of teachers exceeded the 2010 level. This data doesn\u2019t include how much of the decline was due to layoffs, retirements or terminations -- but it\u2019s fair to assume at least some were layoffs. The initial drop of 1,405 teachers falls short of the \"thousands\" cited by Crist. Crist, a Democrat, and Scott, a Republican, have accused each other of causing teacher layoffs. In an ad, Scott blamed Crist for \"3,000 teachers laid off\" during his tenure as governor. That claim was based on a September 2009 report about possible layoffs. Scott\u2019s ad omitted that Crist accepted federal stimulus money that preserved thousands of teacher jobs and that the Republican-controlled Legislature shared responsibility with Crist for cuts that occurred amid a national recession. We rated Scott\u2019s claim Mostly False. Class sizes The second part of the claim about class sizes increasing due to budget cuts is tricky to evaluate because many factors shaped class sizes. Florida voters approved a class-size amendment in 2002, but the state phased it in over several years. The first year schools had to meet the rules at the classroom level was 2010-11. Until that point, class sizes were averaged schoolwide, and a 2010 referendum to keep the school averages failed. The cap limited 18 students between kindergarten and third grade, 22 in fourth to eighth grades, and 25 students in core high school classes. But changes made by the Legislature during Scott\u2019s tenure make it less than meaningful to compare compliance rates from year to year. For example, in 2011, the Legislature reduced the number of courses under the mandate by two-thirds, only requiring core classes needed for graduation to follow the standard. In 2013, the Legislature changed the law so that districts could designate schools as \"schools of choice\" to get around classroom counts. That\u2019s what Pasco did for its entire district, for instance. The Crist campaign cited only one piece of evidence on class sizes: a 2011 Miami Herald article that cited some anecdotes about very large classes in Miami-Dade, including 54 students in a college-prep world history class. According to the Florida Department of Education, here are the percentage of classes that were out of compliance: * 2010-11 (Crist) 5.48 percent * 2011-12 (Scott) 6.56 percent * 2012-13 (Scott) 4.22 percent * 2013-14 (Scott) 2.59 percent So there was a small increase -- about 1 percentage point -- from the last year of Crist to the first year of Scott. But then the numbers went back down. By December 2011, about half of the state\u2019s school districts were in violation of the cap, including Broward and Miami-Dade and Pasco counties. Districts faced fines for violating the mandate. In Broward, more than half of the classes were not in compliance compared to a 97 percent compliance rate the year before. The Tampa Bay Times wrote that in Pasco, \"shrinking local, state and federal revenue caused the board to eliminate several hundred teaching positions in order to balance the budget. The administration and board knew that could mean some classes would exceed the state caps.\" To get fined for such a budgetary storm is \"extremely frustrating,\" Pasco School Board member Steve Luikart said at the time. \"It's stand up and get whipped.\" Nearly all of Miami-Dade\u2019s classes complied with the class size rule in 2011, but the district determined it was cheaper to pay the penalty than hire more staff to meet the cap. \"It did not make economic sense at that time to comply at 100 percent,\" said Antonio Cotarelo, spokesman for the district. State law requires schools to be compliant regardless of funding, and the amount of funding specifically directed toward class size never decreased, according to a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Education. That means it is \"pretty hard to make a direct link between less total education funding and higher class sizes,\" said Cheryl Etters, Department of Education spokeswoman. If the number of teachers statewide declined by 1,400 without being replaced, \"it\u2019s fair to assume that class sizes increased,\" said Ruth Haseman Melton, director of government relations for the Florida School Board Association. However there are a number of factors that influence class sizes, and state budget cuts are only one of them. Student enrollment is a major factor. A district may suddenly have a spike in students due to immigration or migration from other states. A district negotiating with a teachers' union might have decided to increase pay as a tradeoff for larger classes. \"There are many explanations for why a district would struggle with class size one year and not the next...,\" Melton said. \"It\u2019s never as simple as a single sentence to explain almost anything with regard to education funding. There are always a number of factors that affect these things -- there is a not a single reason in one district or another that you could say, \u2018Ah, this is the culpable element for why things went in the wrong direction.\u2019 \" We sent Crist\u2019s claim to a spokesman for Scott\u2019s campaign, who responded with claims promoting Scott\u2019s track record on education funding after his first session. For example, Greg Blair pointed to \"record\" K-12 funding under Scott -- which is accurate in terms of the total amount but not for per pupil."

    "doc": "After a primary campaign extended by the coronavirus, MJ Hegar was selected by Democratic voters in Texas to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in November. Hegar celebrated her primary election win with a virtual victory party hosted on Facebook, with appearances from state officials and members of the Texas Democratic Party. During the event, Hegar talked about the coronavirus and its impact in Texas, stating that \"we had a health care crisis in this state before COVID-19.\" \"Before the pandemic, nearly 1 in every 5 was without access to health care coverage,\" Hegar said. \"And now: 1 in 3. Nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don\u2019t have access to health care insurance because of the record unemployment and because of our health care model that is failing Texas.\" Texas consistently ranks as the state with the highest uninsured rates, but is Hegar right about the number of people without insurance coverage during the coronavirus pandemic? Pre-pandemic insurance levels Hegar\u2019s campaign shared multiple news articles about Texans without health insurance published before and during the pandemic, including recent reporting from the Houston Chronicle highlighting how job losses are leading to a growing population of uninsured Texans. Let\u2019s start with the rate of uninsured Texans before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The Kaiser Health Foundation, a nonprofit health policy research organization, publishes state health facts using detailed data from the Census Bureau, including the insurance status of people under 65 in Texas. More than 4.8 million people under 65 are uninsured \u2014 about 19.9% of the population that age, or about 1 in 5 people, according to the latest Census Bureau data published in 2019. Of those Texans who are insured, about 66% are covered through their employer and 21.6% are covered by Medicaid. Texas is one of 13 states that has not expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which allows people between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (considered middle class) to receive tax credits to offset the cost of insurance plans purchased through an online marketplace. The act also grants free coverage under Medicaid to anyone earning less than 138% of the federal poverty level (which this year is $26,200 for a family of four) in states that have opted to expand the program. Since Texas has not expanded the program, eligibility requirements for the program are more strict and are not based solely on income. In order to qualify, a person must have an annual income below a certain threshold ($51,876 for a family of four) and be pregnant, be a parent or caretaker of children, have a disability or a family member with a disability or be 65 years or older. Pandemic insurance levels Since Texas first shut down segments of the economy to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the unemployment rate has fluctuated, spiking to a record 13.5% in April before falling to 8.6% in June. For comparison, in June of 2019 the unemployment rate in Texas was 3.4%. As people lost their jobs, many also lost their health insurance coverage. The actual calculation of the number of people without coverage is a moving target, as people find new jobs or secure coverage elsewhere after becoming unemployed. But two national studies show that between 650,000 and 1.6 million Texans could have lost coverage since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. In May, the Kaiser Health Foundation released a report estimating the number of people losing job-based health insurance coverage during the pandemic and how many of those individuals are eligible for coverage through Medicaid or through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplace tax credits. Nationally, the report estimates that as many as 26.8 million people will become uninsured, including workers, adult dependents and children. Of those, the report estimates that half are eligible for coverage through Medicaid and others through tax credits. In Texas, that report estimates that 1.6 million people will lose insurance coverage, which would bring the state\u2019s uninsured rate to about 26.5% for people under 65 \u2014 or about 1 in 4 people without health insurance coverage. But these figures don\u2019t speak exactly to Hegar\u2019s claim, which is about the number of people who \"don\u2019t have access to insurance.\" Even though Texas has opted not to expand Medicaid coverage to people with incomes below the poverty line, the report states that unemployment benefits and the temporary $600 weekly payments approved by Congress are likely to push annual income for many of these unemployed workers to levels that would make them eligible for Medicaid coverage in Texas. This means they will be able to access Medicaid coverage and marketplace tax credits for the remainder of the calendar year. Other people who lose coverage could switch to insurance offered through a spouse\u2019s or parents\u2019 employer and others may qualify for coverage but opt not to enroll, according to the report. So even though an estimated 1 in 4 Texans will now be without health insurance coverage, the actual number of people who are uninsured and \"don\u2019t have access to healthcare insurance\" is likely even lower. A July report from Families USA, a research and advocacy non-profit that supports policies that make healthcare more accessible, offers a closer estimate. The report tried to pin down the number of uninsured adults who would be unable to obtain new health insurance coverage after losing employment during the coronavirus pandemic. The report estimates that about 5.4 million people across the country became uninsured after losing their jobs between February and May of this year and could not find new coverage. In Texas, an estimated 659,000 adult workers lost insurance coverage after losing jobs and could not find coverage elsewhere, bringing the rate of uninsured adults in the state at the end of May to 29%, or about 1 in 3 adults, the report found. But these figures are just about workers, and don\u2019t account for children and other dependents who may have been covered by another adult\u2019s health insurance plan through an employer, which means the total number of people who are uninsured is likely higher than this estimate."

The evidence consists of quotes from Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and a Sacramento Bee article that cover Cox's comments at a June press conference. According to the article, Cox supported President Donald Trump's stance on separating immigrant parents from their children at the border, saying \"that\u2019s a congressional problem.\" However, when asked later in the article if he supports separating families, Cox replied that he is \"against\" it. This contradicts Newsom's claim that Cox has \"parroted Trump\" on the issue of family separation.\n\nWhile the term \"parroted\" may suggest a direct copycat of Trump's words, the evidence provided shows that Cox's views are not in complete alignment with Trump's. While both Cox and Trump place blame on Congress for the family separations, Cox does not specifically blame Democrats like Trump does. Additionally, Cox has expressed opposition to separating families, which contradicts Newsom's claim that he shares Trump's views on the issue.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label the claim as \"Conflicting.\" There is evidence to suggest that Cox's views on family separation are not in line with Trump's, and the quote from Newsom does not accurately represent Cox's position on the issue.",
    "doc": "In his run for California governor, Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has repeatedly tried to tie his Republican opponent John Cox to President Trump\u2019s most hardline immigration policies. Newsom did just that in a recent TV interview. He claimed Cox, a San Diego businessman who Trump has endorsed, has \"parroted\" Trump on the president\u2019s controversial family separation policy for those who illegally cross the border. Newsom made the assertion immediately after discussing Cox\u2019s policies, implying that his Republican rival fully supports separating immigrant families. \"Even by relatively moderate positions in the Republican party in California, he\u2019s on the extreme of those positions,\" Newsom told ABC7 in Los Angeles on Aug. 17, 2018. \"He can\u2019t run away from Trump. He parroted, parroted Trump\u2014almost verbatim\u2014on the children\u2019s separation issues at the border.\" Newsom makes his claim in the ABC7 TV interview above. We fact-checked the last portion of Newsom\u2019s statement. Our research It\u2019s not clear which specific words Newsom believes Cox has \"parroted.\" That\u2019s because Trump has made many claims about the child separation policy, some of which blame Democrats in Congress for forcing the crisis. Thousands of children were taken from their parents and sent to detention centers this spring after their families crossed the border. Though Trump eventually ended the policy, hundreds of children remain separated. Trump has also claimed the problem could be solved if people \"Don't come to our country illegally. Come like other people do. Come legally.\" Still, the implication in Newsom\u2019s statement is straigtforward: That Cox and Trump share the same words and viewpoints on the policy. Cox says he's opposed There\u2019s one big problem: Cox clearly stated his opposition to separating families at a June press conference at the state Capitol. The conference and proceeding rally was organized in support of repealing the state\u2019s gas tax increase, one of Cox\u2019s top causes. \"I'm against separating parents and children, I'm a father. I have four daughters. That's a congressional problem,\" Cox told reporters. \"I hope we get a congressional solution very soon. He later added: \"I\u2019m about solutions. \u2026 I hope Congress solves that problem, as well, and I\u2019ll work with it.\" Asked the same month on KGO Radio about the policy, Cox said: \"I would certainly add my voice to try and keep parents and children together.\" Cox was again asked whether he supports separating children from families in an August TV interview on Bloomberg Politics. He did not offer an explicit answer, but said: \"I support getting a solution.\" None of the responses show Cox favors the policy. To support Newsom\u2019s claim, his spokesman Nathan Click pointed to a June Sacramento Bee articlethat covered Cox\u2019s comments at the June press conference. The article begins this way: Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox on Monday backed President Donald Trump's stance on separating immigrant parents from their children at the border, saying, \"that's a congressional problem.\" Cox is quoted later in the article saying he\u2019s \"against\" separating families. In an email, Cox\u2019s spokesman Matt Shupe wrote that Newsom\u2019s statement is \"100 percent FALSE.\" Who\u2019s to blame? Setting aside the key context that Cox has opposed the policy, we examined whether Cox\u2019s words in any other way \"parrot\" Trump\u2019s, as Newsom stated. We found Cox and Trump both say that Congress must solve family separations. But even on this point, there\u2019s a degree of difference. Trump has focused his blame mostly on Democrats in Congress, while Cox hasn\u2019t been that specific. On May 26, Trump tweeted: Then, on June 16, Trump tweeted: PolitiFact and other news organizations have debunked Trump\u2019s false claim that Democrats or others in Congress passed a law that forced the family separations. They have noted the Trump administration is responsible for its own policy. \"There is no such law,\" PolitiFact National wrote in a recent fact check. \"The Homeland Security Department\u2019s longstanding policy is to separate children from their custodians when they are referred for criminal prosecution. Trump\u2019s administration has decided to prosecute all illegal crossings. Families were rarely prosecuted under previous administrations.\""

    "doc": "Concerned Student 1950 has been thrust into the national spotlight after playing a role in ousting the leaders of MU and the University of Missouri System. The activist group, originally made up of 11 black students, drew attention to its cause with protests, a hunger strike by graduate student Jonathan Butler and a boycott by the football team. But before that, the group started by blocking the university's Homecoming Parade on Oct. 10, linking arms in front of the red convertible carrying then-UM System President Tim Wolfe and delaying the parade for about 10 minutes. Juan Williams evoked that incident during \"The Five\" on Fox News Channel, explaining why he thought it was best for Wolfe to resign. \"What happened was the students at some point wanted his attention. They wanted the adult, the man in charge to talk to them, to deal with their dissatisfaction. Apparently a car ran through the students, hit one of them \u2014 and that's Butler, apparently.\" Did Wolfe's driver mow down the protesters? Not according to the police or video of the scene. Parade halt When Concerned Student 1950 blocked Wolfe's car, it did it at a bend in the parade route. The rest of the parade was eventually able to cut through a Domino's Pizza parking lot to circumvent the protesters, but each time Wolfe's driver tried to turn into the parking lot, the protesters rearranged themselves to block the car's path. (Although 11 students in matching shirts started the protest, some parade spectators joined them in the street and helped block the car.) It was during this constrained maneuvering that Wolfe's car made contact with Butler. How hard did it hit him? Neither Butler nor Concerned Student 1950 responded to a request for comment. But he wasn't hospitalized, according to police. Demonstrators' video of the parade shows that Butler remained standing and continued protesting. And video from the Columbia Missourian shows that he continued blocking Wolfe's car until police cleared the street. MU Police Major Brian Weimer told PolitiFact Missouri it was \"incidental contact.\" People at the parade also described the contact between Butler and the car as accidental, though they said the driver seemed impatient and was revving his engine. Butler did file an incident report with MUPD, and Weimer said police \"looked at all the video we could find\" before closing the case and declining to arrest or cite the driver. \"It was nothing intentional,\" Weimer said, adding that sometimes cars move a little bit when switching gears, which the driver was doing to try to get around the protesters. The car \"wasn't trying to drive over them,\" he said. Even if the incident didn't affect Butler's physical well-being, it did emerge as a subplot in the protests that eventually removed Wolfe and then-MU Chancellor R. BowenLoftin. After the Homecoming Parade, Concerned Student 1950 sent a letter and a list of demands to Wolfe. The page-long letter doesn't mention the car contact. But the first demand included it among the grievances for which they wanted an apology: \"We want Tim Wolfe to admit his gross negligence, allowing his driver to hit one of the demonstrators, consenting to the physical violence of bystanders, and lastly refusing to intervene when Columbia Police Department used excessive force with demonstrators.\" And in the days after the parade, Butler routinely cited it on Twitter. Some media outlets, such as Breitbart, have claimed Butler walked into the path of Wolfe's car and made contact with it himself. That website edited the video to show the sequence in slow motion while a narrator asserts that Butler walked into the car. It's clear that Butler was approaching the car before the contact took place, but it's inconclusive on whether Butler was moving or stationary when the contact occurred. It is clear, though, that the collision was minor. Williams didn't respond to a request for comment."

Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim that Mitt Romney's tax plan verifies that the math adds up.",
    "doc": "Mitt Romney\u2019s tax plan plays a vital role in his economic program. He says it by itself will create seven million new jobs. He has been defending his proposal ever since economists at the Tax Policy Center -- a team with both Republican and Democratic connections -- said the numbers in Romney\u2019s plan do not add up. The Obama campaign has relied on that study to attack Romney in television ads and on the stump.In the vice presidential debate, the moderator pressed Paul Ryan to fill in the missing details that would allow a clear assessment of what the tax changes might do. Ryan did not provide any but claimed other analysts confirm that the plan will accomplish everything it promises.\"Six studies have verified that this math adds up,\" Ryan said.This is a claim that Romney and Ryan first made in early September, although back then, they cited five studies. We rated it Mostly False because two of the \"studies\" were actually Wall Street Journal editorials and one was double-counting another research paper.Since then, the campaign has dropped the two editorials and added additional research for the new claim of six studies. For this fact check, we are building on our previous work and examining the claim in light of the additional studies being cited.The basics of Romney\u2019s planBriefly, Romney\u2019s plan would cut individual and corporate rates, and eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. This would put the government in the hole about $5 trillion over 10 years, but Romney would offset that by doing away with deductions, exemptions, credits and other wrinkles in the tax code that currently give people a tax break. Some of the largest ones are the home mortgage deduction and the tax-free treatment of employer health benefits.Romney is clear about the tax cuts, but is largely silent about how he would offset them with reductions in tax breaks. However, he promises that the plan will be revenue neutral and it won\u2019t shift the tax burden from the very rich to the middle class.The six studiesBefore we go through the list, we should note that all of the studies, both those supporting Romney\u2019s plan and the one from the Tax Policy Center, speculate on the details of the deductions and tax breaks that Romney would reduce or eliminate. Martin Feldstein, in the first study, says \"It is impossible to calculate the exact effects of the future reforms since Gov. Romney hasn't specified what he would do.\"Curtis Dubay, the author of the newest study we examine, says (Romney\u2019s) \"plan would offset the revenue loss from those changes by broadening the tax base in unspecified ways.\" In short, all analysts must fill in the blanks. This is akin to trying on a pair of pants before both legs are done.1 & 2. Martin Feldstein, Harvard University \"Romney\u2019s tax plan can raise revenue\" and \"A reply to comments\"Feldstein, an adviser to the Romney campaign, uses 2009 IRS data to demonstrate that Romney can meet all his goals and not increase taxes on the middle class. First he estimates the lost revenue due to Romney\u2019s 20 percent across the board rate cut and the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax. Feldstein figures that would be $186 billion.Next, he looks at how much could be gained by reducing or eliminating deductions.At this point, he makes an important decision. He defines high-income as households making $100,000 or more. The Tax Policy Center sets the bar at $200,000 and anyone making less is part of the middle class. By choosing the broader definition, Feldstein has a lot more revenue to work with.In 2009, Feldstein says, the total value of itemized deductions for households making $100,000 and up was about $636 billion. By his estimate, if you eliminate those deductions, the IRS stands to gain about $191 billion. \"More than enough to offset the revenue losses from the individual income tax cuts proposed by Gov. Romney,\" Feldstein says.Feldstein underscores that he isn\u2019t advocating such a move. He only notes that eliminating deductions, or broadening the tax base as it is called, can net huge returns.In his second piece, Feldstein defends treating households making $100,000 or more as \"high-income\" because they are in the upper 20 percent of income earners. He offers more details on the tax breaks that could be reduced for this group, such as tax-free health benefits and the child tax credit.The responseFeldstein\u2019s definition of middle class is at odds with the one Mitt Romney has used. In an ABC interview, Romney said people making $200,000 or less are part of the middle class and would be protected in his plan.The Tax Policy Center notes that Feldstein needs to go after the deductions used by less affluent people -- those making between $100,000 and $200,000 -- in order to make the books balance.The center analysts also notes that this assumes these people would not be allowed to take even the basic standard deduction. The group further challenges Feldstein\u2019s use of the 30 percent tax rate, saying a more accurate estimate is 24 percent which would leave Feldstein $70 billion short of the revenues lost through the rest of Romney\u2019s tax cuts. (In his response, Feldstein says he could use the lower rate and still make the numbers work by going after other tax breaks.)3. Harvey Rosen, Princeton University \"Growth, distribution and tax reform: Thoughts on the Romney proposal\"Rosen\u2019s main point is that any assessment of the Romney tax plan that ignores its impact on economic growth is incomplete. \"This is curious,\" Rosen said, \"because increasing growth is the motivation for the proposal in the first place.\" Growth creates more income for the government to tax which would help offset the revenues lost through rate cuts.Rosen readily admits that no one can accurately predict the future so he runs the numbers using three growth rates for GDP - 3 percent, 5 percent and 7 percent. By comparison, the White House budget planners assume an average rate of close to 3 percent.Like Feldstein, he used 2009 data. Unlike Feldstein, he analyzed what happens for taxpayers making $100,000 and up, and then repeated it for those making $200,000 and up.Rosen found that when all possible deductions are eliminated, from home mortgages to charitable giving to health insurance benefits, it means that increased revenues can balance out the money lost through tax cuts.There is only one scenario where Rosen saw a wrinkle -- when households making less than $200,000 are shielded from the loss of deductions under certain tax and growth assumptions. Rosen saw a $28 billion gap and said \"maintaining an approximately constant tax burden on high-income individuals would be more challenging.\" But not \"mathematically impossible.\"The responseThe criticism that the Tax Policy Center failed to account for growth is incorrect. William Gale, one of the center\u2019s economists who was on the Council of Economic Advisers for President George H.W. Bush, says the team specifically tested their results using different assumptions of economic growth.\"Incorporating the growth effects did not change the conclusion,\" Gale said.The center said groups including the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation take a cautious approach on assuming that tax changes alone will lead to new growth. This is particularly true when tax cuts are combined with base-broadening, which lies at the heart of the Romney plan.Both Rosen and Feldstein use 2009 data. Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California Berkeley, said 2009 presents problems for analysts. 2009 was the bottom of the recession. In pure dollar amounts, upper income households saw huge investment losses in 2008. When the stock market recovered, they offset those gains with losses from the year before.In 2009, they had less income that would benefit from the lower rates Romney proposes.Accordingly, the cost of a tax cut would be smaller and so would the amount you would need to pick up by getting rid of tax deductions and other tax breaks as Romney has said he wants.Auerbach said 2009 would be a relatively easy year to make the numbers work.4. Matt Jensen, American Enterprise Institute, \"How the Tax Policy Center could improve its Romney tax study\"Jensen challenges the Tax Policy Center findings on two fronts. First, he said it should have considered the elimination of two tax breaks that the center\u2019s analysts said \"were off the table.\" One is the interest on state and local bonds; the other is interest on life insurance policies.\"Both of these exclusions largely benefit the wealthy,\" Jensen said. \"Added together their repeal would net upwards of $90 billion that could be redistributed to lower-income individuals.\" Jensen called his analysis \"nothing if not rough.\"Jensen also said the center\u2019s definition of who is high-income is arbitrary. Rather than declare everyone over $200,000 as high income, he suggested the center show the lowest income level at which the Romney plan would work out mathematically.The responseThe Tax Policy Center challenged Jensen\u2019s \"rough\" number. It said a more accurate figure would be $25 billion.5. Alex Brill, American Enterprise Institute, \"The Romney tax plan: Not a tax hike on the middle class\"Brill also faults the Tax Policy Center for ignoring the impact of growth, but he has three specific criticisms. He says the center made mistakes in how it dealt with taxes related to the health care reform law and gains made on insurance policies. Brill also says the center ignored the option to tax earnings from state and local bonds.The total value of these changes, Brill says, brings the Romney plan within $12 billion of balancing out.The responseAs with the other studies, Brill is off the mark in saying the Tax Policy Center ignored the impact of growth. On his specific criticisms, he finds support for two of them from Josh Barro, a columnist with Bloomberg News who agrees that the Obamacare taxes and life insurance gains should be folded into the picture.But on state and local bonds, Barro disagrees. He says Brill has exaggerated the potential money in this pot. Brill said it would be $20 billion. Barro says only about $5 billion of that goes to bondholders. Following the cash gets complicated very quickly but bottom line, Barro warns that if these bonds are not tax free, then state and local governments would pay more to borrow money.\"A key effect would be state and local governments raising taxes (mostly not on the wealthy) to pay higher interest costs,\" Barro wrote.6. Curtis Dubay, Heritage Foundation, \"The Tax Policy Center\u2019s skewed analysis of Governor Romney\u2019s tax plan\"Dubay relies on three of the studies already listed, from Feldstein, Rosen and Jensen, but adds a new criticism of the Tax Policy Center study. Dubay says the center failed to make adjustment what is called the \"step-up in basis\" from inherited assets.Take the example of inheriting stock from your mother. Under Romney\u2019s plan, there would be no estate tax. If you sold the stock, you would owe taxes on any profit. That profit, Dubay says, should be based on the value of the stock when your mother bought it, not its value when you inherited it. The difference is called a \"step-up\" and getting rid of it makes a lot more money taxable.The Tax Policy Center did not count on this, producing a \"critical error\" that \"significantly biases\" the results, Dubay says. He estimated the value at $19 billion.The responseGale with the Tax Policy Center says Dubay\u2019s change would not generate the revenues he predicts for two reasons. First, not all the inherited property would be sold and for any that wasn\u2019t, no tax would be collected. Second, Dubay uses the current tax rates to calculate the tax collections, but Romney would cut those rates and so the amount of revenues would drop."

    "justification": "The claim \"President Barack Obama's healthcare law is 'expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs'\" is misleading because of how the term \"destruction\" is used inaccurately. The Congressional Budget Office did not say that employers will lay off 2.3 million workers, but rather that workers will choose to reduce their hours voluntarily due to new options for purchasing health insurance outside of their jobs. The CBO estimated that Obamacare would \"reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024,\" which is almost entirely due to workers deciding to supply less labor. Additionally, the CBO did not specify how many of the 2 million figure would include full-time positions.\n\nTherefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the claim made by President Obama's critic John Boehner is misleading based on the evidence provided by the Congressional Budget Office. The word \"destruction\" exaggerates the impact of the Affordable Care Act on employment rates, and the CBO report does not support this claim.",
    "doc": "Ever since President Barack Obama shepherded the Affordable Care Act to enactment, critics have called the health care law a job killer. Now, many of the critics are saying that a new report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office proves their point. The CBO estimated that by 2017, there would be the equivalent ofabout 2 million fewer workers than there would be in the absence of the law. CBO said that number would grow to about 2.5 million by 2024. Shortly after the report was released on Feb. 4, 2014, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, joined many Republicans and conservatives in highlighting this finding via social media. Boehner tweeted, \"Pres. Obama\u2019s #hcr law expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs http://on.wsj.com/1kM33oN via @WSJ.\" (Wonk alert: #hcr is shorthand for \"health care reform.) In short order, Democrats and liberal commentators took issue with such characterizations, saying Obama\u2019s critics were misreading the report. A full-fledged war of facts and spin ensued. We have addressed previous CBO projections of this sort and found reasons to be skeptical of interpretations like Boehner\u2019s. The key problem here is that claims by Boehner -- and other critics -- overlook the difference between workers and jobs, and Boehner was misleading when he used the word \"destroyed.\" He made it sound as if jobs are going away because businesses don\u2019t create them or because they eliminate existing jobs. The CBO report, though, was referring to workers who decide on their own to leave the workforce. The CBO figured that, when presented with new options for purchasing health insurance outside their job, millions of people would decide they don\u2019t need to work as much. \"Workers who now have access to less expensive health insurance through Medicaid or with refundable federal tax credits that help them pay for premiums will not want to work such long hours after the ACA becomes fully implemented,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. The CBO estimated that Obamacare would \"reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor \u2014 given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive.\" This would equal a \"decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024,\" the report continued. These changes, CBO said, would not result in \"an increase in unemployment (that is, more workers seeking but not finding jobs) or underemployment (such as part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week).\" To be clear, the report predicts that total employment will still rise. It just won\u2019t rise as much as it would if the ACA did not exist. Another key point: The CBO did not specify how many of the 2million figure would include full-time positions, as compared to cases of an employee keeping their job but working fewer hours, or keeping one job while quitting a separate, part-time job. In some ways, a drop in the number of people who feel the need to work actually could be a boon to the unemployed. As we\u2019ve noted, there are about three jobseekers for every job vacancy in today\u2019s economy -- a high ratio by historical standards. Some of these people could pick up the slack once vacancies open up -- and they should be able to, since CBO said it didn\u2019t expect a major change in companies\u2019 demand for workers. In essence, you\u2019d be trading workers unhappy to be working for those who are desperate to be working. \"Unemployed workers who really need to find jobs to support their families, rather than to obtain health coverage, will find it easier to get jobs,\" Burtless said. \"After all, they will not face as much competition from the workers who were mainly remaining in the labor force to get a job with health coverage.\" We see a few problems with Boehner\u2019s phrasing -- that the law is \"expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs.\" (We have no quarrel with the 2.3 million figure; it\u2019s the mid-point between 2.0 million and 2.5 million.) The first problem is the word \"destroy.\" It\u2019s inaccurate because it suggests that CBO says employers will be making 2.3 million layoffs. That's not correct -- the reduction will come primarily from voluntary choices by workers, not by by employers, the CBO said. The second problem is the word \"jobs.\" Using that word glosses over the fact that CBO didn\u2019t cite a number of jobs that will be reduced; it referred to full-time-equivalents of jobs. That may sound like a technical distinction, but it\u2019s important. These job equivalents will be made of a lot of bits and pieces of hours per week that people will choose to drop. Many of these people might be working two or three jobs, in excess of 40 hours a week, and will choose to cut back to a more reasonable one or two jobs. All this said, it\u2019s also worth pointing out a few less positive conclusions of the CBO report. As more people choose to work less, the labor force participation rate should decline, putting a larger burden for supporting the social safety net on those who remain working. Any change in labor force participation comes on top of an already major shift toward retirement driven by the aging of the baby boom. Also, some commentators have expressed concern about having people work less because taxpayer-subsidized insurance is available. Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. \"Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to,\" Sinclair said. \"But overall I think separating health care from employment, at least making it like any other service where employment may provide the money to pay for it but where we work doesn't determine our choices, is a good thing.\" Sinclair said Boehner has a reasonable point in terms of the larger economic impact of these changes, but adds that he\u2019s largely wrong in how he framed the labor-market question. \"In a macroeconomic sense, this still means fewer people working, even if that is their choice,\" she said. On the other hand, she added, \"it also probably means relatively higher wages and better bargaining power for those who are looking for a job. This is very different than the short-run effects of employers cutting positions, where we would see unemployment rates go up, less bargaining power for workers, and potentially relatively lower wages. So, the description of the source of the cut -- whether it\u2019s from supply or demand -- does matter, but not for the count of \u2018jobs.\u2019 \" When we checked with Boehner\u2019s office, spokesman Brendan Buck reiterated that the CBO report shows that \"there will be that many fewer people working \u2013 that many fewer people in jobs. Whether a result of a change in supply or demand for labor, that\u2019s still bad for the economy. If there\u2019s an error, it\u2019s for tweeting in English instead of \u2018economist.\u2019\""

    "justification": "The claim that \"If labor force participation rate were the same as when Barack Obama became president, unemployment would be 11 percent\" is True based on the evidence provided.\n\nThe evidence shows that the labor force participation rate was lower in May 2012 than it was in January 2009. Specifically, the participation rate was 63.8% in May 2012 compared to 65.7% in January 2009. If the same percentage of Americans were employed or looking for work in May 2012 as in January 2009, the general unemployment rate would have been 11% instead of 8.2%.\n\nTo support this claim, Paul Ryan's office provided data, calculations, and supporting news coverage. The data shows that if the same percentage of Americans were employed or looking for work in May 2012 as in January 2009, there would be 4.6 million more people actively seeking work right now, leading to an unemployment rate of 11.2%.\n\nThe math is straightforward: if the labor force participation rate were the same as when Obama became president, the total labor force would be larger, and the unemployment rate would be higher. The evidence supports this claim, and it is reasonable to conclude that if the labor force participation rate were the same as when Obama became president, unemployment would be 11%.\n\nIt is important to note that the assumptions underlying this claim are critical. The claim assumes that all 4.6 million adults added to the labor force would be unemployed, which may not be the case. Additionally, the claim uses BLS figures that were not rounded off as much as the ones Seifert used to describe his math to us, which could affect the result slightly. However, based on the evidence provided, it is reasonable to conclude that if labor force participation rate were the same as when Obama became president, unemployment would be 11%.",
    "doc": "At the Texas Republican Party\u2019s 2012 convention, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin told the crowd that the high stakes in November\u2019s election include American jobs.\"If the amount of Americans were in the workforce today like they were when President Obama took office, the labor force participation rate, our unemployment rate would be 11 percent today,\" the House Budget Committee chairman said in his keynote speech June 9, 2012.We decided to check.First, we defined our terms.The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the U.S. labor force participation rate by taking the total workforce -- people who are employed or job-hunting -- and dividing by the total civilian population aged 16 or older. (People in military, medical or penal institutions are excluded.)The general unemployment rate, which is the one most people are familiar with, expresses how many people in the labor force are unemployed.Generally, climbs and dips in the general unemployment rate are a reasonable indicator that more Americans are losing jobs or getting hired, respectively. But in times of recession, high numbers of workers simply stop looking for jobs. Common reasons they give are retirement, disability, going to school or caring for household members, according to researchers at the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank who drew on federal data. But when adults stop looking for work, the overall workforce shrinks, which can have the effect of reducing the unemployment rate -- which could lead to erroneous conclusions about U.S. economic conditions.To counteract that effect, the BLS also calculates what it calls the U-6 unemployment rate, which folds in people who stopped job-hunting and people who took part-time jobs for economic reasons. Since the U-6 rate was first published in 1994, its three highest points have all accompanied recessions, first in 1990-91, then 2001 and most recently 2007-09.Of late, Republicans have taken to highlighting this distinction, as Ryan does here.His claim can be restated this way: If the same percentage of Americans were employed or looking for work in May 2012 as in January 2009, general unemployment would have been 11 percent instead of 8.2 percent.We asked Ryan\u2019s office for his backup materials, and spokesman Kevin Seifert sent us data, calculations and supporting news coverage.Seifert told us by email that according to the BLS, the January 2009 workforce participation rate was 65.7 percent, while the May 2012 rate was 63.8 percent. Applying those to the May 2012 population of 243 million, he said, gives a labor force of 159.6 million at the first rate and 155 million at the latter rate.Subtracting the real labor force (155 million) from the hypothetical labor force (159.6 million) shows \"that 4.6 million more people would actively be seeking work right now instead of being characterized as discouraged, etc.,\" he wrote.Adding 4.6 million unemployed workers to the May 2012 unemployment count, which was 12.7 million, would give a total 17.3 million unemployed, Seifert said. Then, 17.3 million unemployed people divided by 155 million would give a general unemployment rate of 11.2 percent, Seifert said.We checked the numbers and math for ourselves, then asked Cheryl Abbot, a Dallas-based regional economist for the labor bureau, for help analyzing the calculations. It looked to us like Ryan should have divided by the hypothetical labor force, rather than the real May 2012 labor force (to correctly describe the unemployment rate of the larger, hypothetical group), and Abbot agreed. But neither that distinction nor small differences due to causes such as rounding off numbers seriously affected the result.Accepting the assumption that all 4.6 million adults added to the labor force would be unemployed -- and using BLS figures that were not rounded off as much as the ones Seifert used to describe his math to us -- Abbot got a result of 10.9 percent."

    "claim": "\"The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has estimated that the Obama administration\u2019s Power Plan will cause energy costs in Texas to rise as much as 16 percent per year.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "interval",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, the claim that energy costs in Texas will rise as much as 16 percent per year due to the Obama administration's Power Plan is false. The ERCOT report states that energy costs may increase by up to 16% by 2030 due to the Clean Power Plan alone, without accounting for other factors such as transmission upgrades, higher natural gas prices, procurement of additional ancillary services, and other costs associated with the retirement or decreased operation of coal-fired capacity in the ERCOT Region. This implies that the increase in energy costs will be over a longer period of time than 16 percent per year.\n\nMoreover, the estimate of a 16 percent increase by 2030 is based on conservative assumptions and does not include costs for upgrades. ERCOT stands by this estimate, indicating that it is correct. Therefore, the claim made by Rep. Lamar Smith is incorrect, and the label \"False\" is appropriate.\n\nIt's worth noting that the increase in energy costs due to the Clean Power Plan may have a significant impact on Texans, with energy costs rising from $2,160 in 2009 to around $2,777 in today's dollars by 2030 if energy costs rise 16 percent per year. This would mean that energy costs would eat up closer to 15 percent of household income, rather than the 5 percent suggested by the estimate assuming a 16 percent increase per year.",
    "doc": "U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been frequent sparring partners. In a Dec. 6, 2015 oped column, Smith, R-San Antonio, took to the San Antonio Express-News to warn readers against the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan. The EPA has described the Clean Power Plan as a necessary, though not sufficient, step in addressing climate change -- and as part of a larger strategy to spur other nations to reduce emissions. It was the subject of a previous fact check. The plan is aimed at states with fossil-fuel fired electrical plants. Smith wrote: \"Texans will be hit even harder than those in other states. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has estimated that the Obama administration\u2019s Power Plan will cause energy costs in Texas to rise as much as 16 percent per year.\" According to the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, ERCOT manages 90% of the electrical load of Texas; it is a nonprofit corporation. The way the statement is phrased, it sounds as though every year energy costs in Texas will rise 16 percent. But the ERCOT report on the effects of the EPA Clean Power Plan says the increase will be over a longer period of time. Smith\u2019s statement was based on incorrect information provided by an ERCOT official to his House Science, Space and Technology Committee. The ERCOT Oct. 16, 2015 report and an accompanying news release says that \"energy costs for customers may increase by up to 16% by 2030 due to the CPP alone, without accounting for the associated costs of transmission upgrades, higher natural gas prices caused by increased gas demand, procurement of additional ancillary services, and other costs associated with the retirement or decreased operation of coal-fired capacity in the ERCOT Region\" (ERCOT does not estimate how much these other factors might raise energy costs in their analysis). In other words, by 2030, energy costs will have risen 16 percent since the CPP took effect. So, how big is the disparity between a 16 percent increase by 2030 and a 16 percent increase each year until 2030? It helps to know when the Clean Power Plan is scheduled to come into effect. According to the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan Final Rule, states with fossil fuel-fired electric generating units need to create plans that set emissions standards for those units. Vermont and the District of Columbia are exempt because they have none of the relevant units, and Alaska and Hawaii are exempt because the EPA says it lacks enough information to determine the best system of emission reduction for non-contiguous states. Plans are due in 2016 (with a possible extension to 2018), and the reduction in emissions needs to start by 2022, with extra rewards for states that also cut emissions in 2020 and 2021. If energy costs rise 16 percent each year from 2022 until 2030, that is roughly a 327 percent increase in the cost of energy. To help put this in real terms, we crunched some numbers on energy costs in Texas. The U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s Residential Energy Consumption Survey reported the average annual electricity cost per Texas household at $2,160 in 2009, the last year for which data are available, and just under 4.5 percent of the median household income in Texas that year. Adjusted for inflation, that\u2019s about $2,394 in 2015. If the Clean Power Plan caused energy costs to increase 16 percent by 2030, that bill would rise to about $2,777 in today\u2019s dollars. If energy costs increased 16 percent per year, though, that bill would be $7,828. The median household income in Texas was $53,035 by the last Census. The first price would mean Texans would spend around 5 percent of their yearly household income on energy, while the higher number implies energy costs would eat up closer to 15 percent of income. Smith, whose 21st Congressional District includes portions of San Antonio, Austin and the Texas Hill Country, is chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, with jurisdiction over the EPA, NOAA and NASA. A spokeswoman for his committee, Laura Crist, said in an email statement that the congressman\u2019s claim of a 16-percent increase per year was based on communications with ERCOT staff. She noted that the ERCOT estimate is conservative and does not include costs for upgrades. ERCOT, meanwhile, stood by the estimate in the report. \"It\u2019s the 16 percent by 2030 that\u2019s correct,\" said Robbie Searcy, ERCOT communications manager. Searcy said in a telephone interview that information provided to the House committee \"created a misunderstanding in the congressman\u2019s office and that\u2019s why there was an error.\""

    "doc": "A reader questioned Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s comparison of military spending to how much it costs Americans to get their taxes done. According to a blog post on txwinelover.com, Cruz toured Becker Vineyards in July 2014 before holding a roundtable with wine industry representatives during which he agreed the tax system should be simplified. \"Every year,\" Cruz elaborated, \"we spend roughly $500 billion on tax compliance. That is roughly the budget of our entire military, entirely wasted on tax compliance. I agree with you we should move to a simple flat tax where everyone can fill out their taxes on a postcard and that we should shut down the IRS.\" Cruz, a Texas lawyer elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012, has since declared his candidacy for president. But he\u2019d already called for a flat-rate income tax and abolishing the IRS. And was he right that about the same $500 billion a year getting spent on complying with tax laws and funding the military? Both figures need explaining. Military spending Per military spending, Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said by email that Cruz drew on a chart posted by The Washington Post in 2012 indicating that adjusted for inflation, defense spending has exceeded $500 billion a year since 2007 or so: SOURCE: Blog post, \"Defense spending in the U.S., in four charts,\" Wonkblog, The Washington Post, Aug. 28, 2012, chart citing Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (noted in an email from Rick Tyler, chief national spokesperson, Ted Cruz presidential campaign, May 5, 2015) The Post relied on the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments where by email, analyst Todd Harrison told us the military\u2019s 2014 base budget, meaning the cost of maintaining a standing military in peacetime, totaled $496 billion. So far so good, except, Harrison advised, that figure did not reflect all military spending. Generally, he said, the base budget \"does not include the cost of using the military to fight a conflict, nor does it include legacy costs, such as unfunded pensions and veterans benefits, or military activities conducted outside of (the Department of Defense) such as the maintenance and upgrade of nuclear weapons. All of those things are extra,\" he said. If you count those other expenses, Harrison said, the U.S. spent $866 billion on the military in 2014. By email, Tyler stressed the military\u2019s base budget doesn\u2019t include overseas contingencies. But it\u2019s \"your rigged game, you make up any facts you want,\" Tyler said by email. Next, we turned to what it costs Americans to fulfill federal tax requirements. Tax compliance costs To get our arms around \"compliance costs,\" we reached out to certified public accountant Connie Weaver, a Texas A&M University professor, who guided us to June 2011 testimony on compliance costs by tax expert Michael Brostek of the investigative arm of Congress, the General Accountability Office. Broadly, Brostek said that complying with IRS regulations \"costs taxpayers time and money,\" at least $107 billion in 2005, the GAO estimated, with other studies estimating costs 1.5 times as large. Beyond compliance costs, Bostek noted even larger estimated \"economic efficiency costs, which are reductions in economic well-being caused by changes in behavior due to taxes.\" Previous fact checks Even before Cruz commented at the roundtable, the FactChecker at The Washington Post awarded two Pinocchios to House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s claim that it was costing Americans $500 billion a year to comply with federal tax demands. Cost estimates varied, the Post wrote, with the \"safest bet\" at the time being $163 billion as estimated by the IRS\u2019s Taxpayer Advocate Service, entrusted with helping taxpayers resolve problems and recommending changes. Adjusting for inflation, that cost would have been nearly $172 billion a year around the time Cruz spoke in 2014. More recently, the FactChecker weighed in again after noticing Cruz made his $500 billion military-tax compliance spending comparison at a May 2015 South Carolina stop. Like Boehner, Cruz drew a couple Pinocchios. Weaver told us that because Cruz didn\u2019t say what he meant by compliance costs \u2014 where he\u2019d draw the boundaries \u2014 an observer could explore three possibilities: a taxpayer\u2019s basic liability as in how much he or she sends the government in taxes; the costs associated with pulling together information and submitting it to the government; or efficiency costs as in \"lost outputs, time taken from other productive activities or from missing out on other consumption activities.\" For an individual, she said, it\u2019s easy to calculate compliance costs by gauging how long it takes to fill out the required forms and multiplying that by an hourly dollar figure for how the individual values their time. \"When you try to aggregate that nationally,\" she said, \"it\u2019s very difficult.\" She said she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable specifying a national compliance-costs figure. But all in all, Weaver said, it looks like Cruz\u2019s figure was high. Cruz aide: Senator relied on two studies Tyler told us Cruz got his tax-compliance costs from an April 2011 analysis by supply-side economist Arthur B. Laffer and others indicating $431.1 billion in combined annual costs incurred by taxpayers to pay federal taxes and a May 2013 study by researchers at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University stating the annual \"hidden costs\" of U.S. tax compliance ranged from $215 billion to $987 billion. Laffer study The Laffer-led study said researchers created a \"comprehensive estimate of the total administrative costs, time costs, and direct tax compliance costs created by the complex U.S. federal income tax code.\" The $431.1 billion in estimated annual spending, the report said, reflects money spent \"to comply with and administer the U.S. income tax system.* Its estimate, relying on 2010 figures, broke out to approximately $31.5 billion in direct outlays (paying a professional tax preparer or purchasing tax software), total IRS administrative costs of $12.4 billion; and nearly $378 billion for the \"time value costs taxpayers must bear to pay their taxes,\" filling out and submitting forms. In 2011, the Post\u2019s FactChecker called the Laffer study \"dubious,\" noting it took a figure from the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Tax Advocate \u2014 that individuals and businesses spent 6.1 billion hours complying with tax filing requirements \u2014 and got to its cost estimate by multiplying \"it against an absurd hourly income of $68.42 on the theory that the wealthy pay most of the income taxes.\" Mercatus Center study The Mercatus Center\u2019s study, led by Jason J. Fichtner, a senior research fellow, similarly noted the high wage costs applied in the Laffer study, stating that in the study, the \"average income used to monetize taxpayers\u2019 time is significantly greater than the average income used in other estimates.\" For its part, the center suggested a range of hidden costs connected to paying taxes including \"time and money spent submitting tax forms, foregone economic growth, lobbying expenditures, and gaps in revenue collection\" though the authors said they couldn\u2019t pin a figure for lobbying by interests trying to reduce taxes paid. As far as compliance costs, what Cruz singled out, the center study estimated $67 billion to $378 billion a year in accounting costs associated with filing taxes, a range based on IRS information suggesting 60 percent of individual taxpayers and 71 percent of unincorporated business taxpayers pay someone--an accountant, lawyer or tax professional--to prepare their taxes, with 32 percent of individual taxpayers relying on software. Significantly, Fichtner told us, his paper, based on a review of relevant studies, was intended to cover far more than simple compliance costs. \"I chose to give a range based on the different methodologies that I found in the research literature. It\u2019s not that one method is better than another\u2013or right versus wrong,\" Fichtner said. \"All the measures have different assumptions for the time value of an hour of lost work/productivity as well as time spent.\" Here\u2019s a chart from the study summarizing a range of cost studies dating back to 2003: Other analyses Next, we asked the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation about Cruz\u2019s figure. Spokesman Richard Borean said by email it had no analysis to confirm or refute the $500 billion figure. But he noted the Mercatus Center study and suggested we consider annual reports on tax compliance costs put out by the National Taxpayers Union, a non-partisan research and educational organization that says it\u2019s devoted to showing Americans how taxes, government spending and regulations affect them. The union\u2019s April 2014 report, which would have been the the latest one available before Cruz spoke, noted the IRS\u2019s National Taxpayer Advocate had most recently estimated the annual paperwork burden generated by the federal personal and corporate tax system at 6.1 billion hours \u2014 the equivalent of about 3.05 million employees working 40-hour weeks year-round with two weeks off each. The group said: \"The value of the labor behind the 6.1 billion hours amounts to a jaw-dropping $192.6 billion, when calculated with the most recently reported average employer cost for non-federal civilian workers by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: $31.57 per hour. Add in the $31.7 billion spent on tax software and other out-of-pocket costs for individuals and the total is $224.3 billion a year.\" (The union\u2019s latest look at compliance costs, released in April 2015, said compliance with the federal income tax cost the economy $233.8 billion in productivity in 2014.)"

    "doc": "Residents along Brodie Lane in Southwest Travis County who want a highway to divert inbound commuters say Karen Huber is blocking the way.Former County Judge Bill Aleshire, who lives on Brodie, suggested we check this statement from Huber, a Democrat campaigning to keep her Precinct 3 seat on the Travis County Commissioners Court: \"I've never said, \u2018Don't build it.' I've said, \u2018Prove the cost-benefit is there.'\u2009\"That could prove of interest to Nov. 6 voters deciding between Huber and Republican opponent Gerald Daugherty, a staunch supporter of building Texas 45 Southwest \u2014 a 3.6-mile road that would connect FM 1626 and South MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1).Huber has taken action against the project both as a commissioner and as a member of the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization. But has she supported not building it?The comment Aleshire flagged came from a Sept. 17, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story, so we began by talking to the newspaper\u2019s transportation reporter, Ben Wear, and asking Aleshire for evidence contradicting Huber.Wear and archived Statesman stories got us up to speed on the long-proposed project. Currently pitched as a four-lane tollway divided by a median, it\u2019s been part of the CAMPO long-range transportation plan for years; the right-of-way for it was purchased in 1997.Every five years, CAMPO\u2019s board approves a rewrite of the 25-year plan, which looks at everything from roads, trains, planes, public transit and freight to bikes and feet in Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell counties. \"Any road or transit project that uses federal money, as most of them do, must be in the plan to qualify for that money,\" said a May 24, 2010, Statesman news story.This stretch of Texas 45 Southwest was proposed in the mid-1980s as part of a Texas 45 that encircled the entire metropolitan area and was to be dubbed the Austin Outer Parkway. Some segments were later built, others abandoned.Wear described the road\u2019s potential impact today \u2014 or rather, sometime after 2020 to 2025, when construction might start under CAMPO\u2019s plan \u2014 in his Feb. 5, 2012, column: A horde of exurbanites from places such as Kyle and Buda comes up FM 1626 each weekday morning to go to work in Austin. Right now, those people have to then take crowded Brodie Lane (and then Slaughter Lane or William Cannon Drive) to get to MoPac. Texas 45 Southwest would allow those commuters a more or less straight shot to MoPac. Critics of Texas 45 Southwest, including Huber, say there\u2019s not enough evidence that the highway would ease Brodie traffic. They also cite environmental concerns, because the road would cross the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone.In a June 11, 2010, opinion piece in the Statesman, Huber wrote: Because of constraints on transportation funding, Texas 45 SW is now proposed as a toll road. No study yet demonstrates that commuters would pay the tolls and avoid Brodie. ... It is irresponsible to spend an estimated $100 million on Texas 45 SW without effectively justifying it. Meanwhile, there are other projects of much more demonstrated need and much higher priority that must be built first, like increasing vehicle capacity on South MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) and improvements to the Y at Oak Hill. According to Statesman news stories, Huber introduced a resolution in May 2010 asking her Commissioners Court colleagues to support culling 45 from the CAMPO plan. It passed 3-1, effectively ending county backing for the road.Huber is also a member of the CAMPO board, which consists mainly of local elected officials. In that capacity, she made an unsuccessful motion later in May 2010 to drop 45 from the plan.The board approved the plan with two votes against (one being Huber\u2019s) and 17 votes in favor. The May 24, 2010, Statesman story quotes Huber: \"We've got real priority problems in this plan. I cannot support this plan, because I cannot support business as usual.\"The story said, \"However, she did successfully knock down an eleventh-hour recommendation from TxDOT that construction on Texas 45 Southwest begin in 2015 rather than 2020.\"Aleshire, whom we interviewed by phone and email, sent us news articles and documents describing Huber\u2019s opposition to the road. None quoted Huber saying she wanted to stop the road outright, though they included instances of Huber offering reasons not to proceed immediately. We asked editors at two local newspapers covering the Texas 45 issue whether they recalled or had reported Huber saying \"Don\u2019t build it\" or something similarly unequivocal. Editor Will Atkins of the Oak Hill Gazette and managing editor Veronica Gordon of the Hays Free Press each told us by phone they did not recall such a statement. Atkins searched his paper\u2019s archives, also finding no such statement.While Aleshire acknowledged he didn\u2019t have direct evidence, he told us that the \"proof is her motion at Commissioners Court to remove it from the county plans and her motion at CAMPO to delete it from the Metropolitan Transportation Plan entirely, making the project ineligible for state or federal funding.\"Were Huber\u2019s actions to pull 45 out of the plan equivalent to saying \"Don\u2019t build it\"?In a phone interview, CAMPO director Maureen McCoy told us she didn\u2019t think removing 45 from the plan would keep it from being built because it could later be restored to the plan by an amendment. It\u2019s \"not atypical\" for a road to be added to the plan that way, she said.If the road weren\u2019t in the plan, it wouldn\u2019t be eligible for federal funding. We asked TxDOT Austin spokesman Chris Bishop how likely it was that the state could build such a road. \"We have done roads without it,\" he said. \"Matter of fact, at one point I remember this was proposed as being done with state funds.\"He recalled two nearby examples of roads built with state funding, albeit two decades ago: Texas 45 Southwest between FM 1826 and MoPac and the stretch of South MoPac to Texas 71/Ben White Boulevard.Whether the puzzle pieces of state funding, local funding, potential toll revenues, etc., would come together for this road is a variable, he and McCoy said, as is the project\u2019s eventual cost. McCoy pointed out that the study now being conducted on the road\u2019s environmental impact could indicate, for example, that the road should have two lanes instead of four.By telephone, Huber told us she\u2019s been consistent in her position: \"I\u2019m saying, on that road, that I do not believe we should move forward with it till we conclude that it is going to do what they say it is going to do\" (in easing Brodie traffic).Now, in fact, Huber said she doesn\u2019t mind keeping 45 in the CAMPO plan, because that allows the environmental study to continue. \"I just don\u2019t believe we should go to construction until we have answers.\""

Therefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "Disappointing job numbers -- 126,000 added jobs in March -- put the White House on the defensive and energized President Barack Obama\u2019s critics. Conservative columnist George Will noted how poorly Obama stacks up against Republican icon Ronald Reagan. \"During the Reagan recovery there were 23 months of job creation over 300,000,\" Will said on Fox News Sunday. \"Reagan had a month of job creation of 1 million, and this was at a time when there were 75 million fewer Americans.\" Will is correct that across President Reagan\u2019s two terms, there were 23 months when the economy added over 300,000 jobs (the average monthly gain once the recovery took hold in March 1983was about 250,000 jobs). But the focus of this fact-check is Will\u2019s claim that Reagan oversaw a month when employment shot up by 1 million. Dave Weigel of Bloomberg Politics questioned Will\u2019s claim, and we thought it was worth examining. We emailed Will and his assistant and did not hear back by the time we published, but there can be only one month that Will had in mind. It is September 1983. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employer data showed 1.1 million more people getting paychecks in September than in August. This would be extraordinary except for one thing. On August 7, 1983, about 675,000 telephone workers went on strike. At the end of the month, they approved a contract and went back to work. In the interim, the Labor Department gathered its payroll data -- and, essentially, documented the effect of the strike. \"No doubt the striking workers returning to their jobs would have created a big bump in employment,\" said Doug Rossinow, a historian at Metropolitan State University in St. Paul, Minn., and author of The Reagan Era: A history of the 1980s. Put simply, the strike jangled the monthly job counts on both ends. It drove down the tally for August and pumped it up in September (and drove it back down for October). This graph using government data shows what happened: The government\u2019s September 1983 jobs report explicitly tied the 1.1 million spike to the labor dispute. \"Nonagricultural payroll employment rose by 735,000 in September,\" the report said. \"About 675,000 of this increase, however, represented the return of employees to payrolls following settlement of strikes, chiefly that of communications workers.\" Newspapers were careful not to read too much into the big number. The New York Times wrote that the recovery was gaining ground with a rise of \"nearly 400,000, in the overall number of people employed.\" The Labor Department did not count the striking workers as employed in August because they weren\u2019t drawing a paycheck. But the jobs they had on Aug. 6, 1983, were waiting for them when they settled at the end of the month. The claim that 1.1 million new jobs were added in a single month has been debunked before, as recently as January 2015."

Goodlatte may be missing important context and glosses over the fact that the low number of prosecutions is due to a lack of priority placed on pursuing these charges, rather than any intentional action by President Obama. Therefore, while there is some evidence to support the claim, it is also unclear and subject to interpretation based on the provided evidence.",
    "doc": "U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th, wants the Department of Justice to strengthen enforcement of existing gun laws before Congress adds more. He was part of a panel on ABC\u2019s \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\" on April 14 and criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s administration for lax prosecution of people caught lying on federal background checks necessary to purchase to guns. \"Enforcement is down 40 percent overall in his administration,\" Goodlatte said. U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., challenged the statement. \"George Bush\u2019s presidency had the same dismal record on enforcement of the background check as this presidency has during the last four years,\" he said. We decided to check whether enforcement is down 40 percent under Obama, a figure Goodlatte cited three days before gun control legislation failed in the U.S. Senate. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System began operating in 1998. It\u2019s an automated system that enables a gun seller to instantly check a series of state and federal databases to determine whether a potential purchaser is eligible to buy a gun under national and state laws. A very low percentage -- about 1 or 2 percent -- are rejected each year, usually for a felony conviction or indictment. Other reasons, such as adjudication for mental illness or an outstanding order of protection, are also grounds for denial. Goodlatte\u2019s spokeswoman sent us to TRAC, a Syracuse University website that collects monthly data from the Department of Justice. We looked there, as well as the department\u2019s original reports. We focused only on prosecutions resulting from background checks -- as opposed to prosecution of other gun offenses -- because Goodlatte\u2019s comments were directed at background checks. We also ignored prosecutions by state officials because the congressman\u2019s statement referred to the presidential role. Federal prosecution data is available from 2002 through 2010, except for 2004. During the six years data is available for former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration -- 2002-2003 and 2005-2008 -- a total of 628 federal cases were prosecuted as a result of failed background checks. That averages about 105 annually. Only two years of statistics are available for Obama\u2019s administration: 77 cases were prosecuted in 2009 and 44 in 2010. That averages to about 61 annually. Another year of data should be released this summer. When we compare the administrations -- realizing there are years of data missing for each -- there has been a 42 percent decline in average annual prosecutions between the Bush and Obama years. So Goodlatte\u2019s claim sounds right, but it\u2019s missing important context: The Justice Department has never placed a high priority on pursuing perjury charges from background checks. There are about 70,000 denials for gun purchases a year. Under Bush, 15/100th of 1 percent of the cases were prosecuted. Under Obama, 8/100th of 1 percent of the cases were prosecuted. Goodlatte glossed over this fact as he assigned blame to Obama. He set up his statement with some quick statistics: \"We have determined of the 76,000 people who were found to have lied on the background check in 2010, 4,700 of them were referred by the ATF for further investigation and prosecution, 62 of them were prosecuted,\" he said. (We should note that 62 prosecutions is inaccurate; the correct number is 44). \"Every Republican on the House Judiciary Committee signed a letter to the president and the attorney general asking why that is and why there isn\u2019t greater enforcement,\" Goodlatte continued. \"Enforcement is down 40 percent overall in his administration. The answer we got about the background checks was, `those are paper crimes.\u2019\" Goodlatte didn\u2019t respond when Gutierrez said the Bush and Obama administrations \"had the same dismal record.\" Why is Uncle Sam reluctant to prosecute these cases? A 2004 reportfrom the Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general provided several answers. It said agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms viewed the violations \"as distracting from more important cases, such as those involving firearms, traffickers, gangs, arson and explosives\" and \"saw little purpose in investigating a standard case in which the NICS successfully prohibited a person from purchasing a firearm.\" The report also said that the cases lack \"jury appeal\" for prosecutors because it is difficult to prove that a prohibited person intentionally lied on the background check and in many parts of the nation \"juries are reluctant to convict a person who attempted to purchase a hunting rifle.\""

As the article notes, the U.S. population has increased by 73 percent over that period, which means that the poverty rate today is actually lower than it was in 1959.\n\nFurthermore, the article points out that the claim ignores the blame for high poverty rates. While the article does not attribute the high poverty rates solely to President Obama, it suggests that he bears some responsibility. Therefore, the label conflicting is appropriate because the evidence provided does not fully support the claim made by Newt Gingrich.",
    "doc": "In a statement submitted in advance of the Nov. 9, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Michigan, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., decried the reach of poverty today. \"More Americans are in poverty today than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping records on it over 50 years ago,\" he said. Although CNBC asked candidates to submit opening statements and posted them on its website, when the debate opened they ditched them. But we thought Gingrich's statement was worth checking. Gingrich has focused on poverty before, accusing President Barack Obama of being \"the most successful food stamp president in American history\" because \"47 million Americans are on food stamps.\" (We rated this statement Half True.) We decided to check whether Gingrich is right in this new statement, so we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which is the official federal source of poverty statistics. Gingrich is right that the numbers go back more than half a century, to 1959, and that the absolute numbers of people in poverty in 2010 -- 46.1 million -- is at its highest since the statistic has been recorded. However, Gingrich ignores population growth since 1959. Over that period, the U.S. population has increased by 73 percent. So today\u2019s poverty rate -- that is, the percentage of people in poverty -- is 15.1 percent, compared to a high of 22.4 percent in 1959. Between 1959 and 1965, the poverty rate was higher every year than it is today. That paints a somewhat different picture than what Gingrich suggested. Still, the poverty rate in 2010 was higher than it\u2019s been in every year for more than four decades save one -- 1983, when the rate was 15.2 percent -- and that\u2019s largely in tune with Gingrich\u2019s larger point. A final note: Unlike his claim about food stamps, Gingrich was more oblique about the blame Obama bears for this statistic. But he does seem to blame the president. After saying that \"more Americans are in poverty today than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping records on it over 50 years ago,\" Gingrich added, \"President Obama and his administration have tried to blame the persistent unemployment and economic stagnation on the severity of the recession they inherited. However, the historical record shows us that the deeper the recession the stronger the recovery. America should at worst be finishing the second year of a booming recovery by now.\" It\u2019s impossible to parcel out blame for the nation\u2019s economic troubles in a scientific fashion, but we think that it\u2019s unfair to place that much of the blame for high poverty on Obama."

    "doc": "If it weren\u2019t for Democratic presidential candidateHillary Clinton, there likely wouldn\u2019t yet be an Iran nuclear deal, according to theformer Secretary of State. While her Republican rivals who oppose the Iran deal might use that line against her, Clinton has touted progress with Iran as one of the hallmarks of her tenure at the State Department. \"I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table,\" she said at the MSNBC Democratic forum Nov. 6. She\u2019s said this line a few times throughout her campaign, so we decided to dig into it. According to her campaign, Clinton was referring to her first 18 months as secretary -- from January 2009 to June 2010. During this time, U.S. and global sanctions on Iran increased, it\u2019s fair to say that Clinton and the State Department played a major role in this development. The invitation Upping sanctions on Iran was a clear priority for Clinton\u2019s State Department. She talked at length about the importance of pressuring Iran to discontinue nuclear activity, including through sanctions, at her nomination hearing in January 2009. She and other members of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration regularly spoke publicly about the topic throughout her first 18 months in office. During this time period, the State Department -- top aides and Clinton herself -- led the diplomatic lobbying effort to get other countries to join the U.S. plan to pressure Iran, overcoming large hurdles such as getting Russia and China to get on board. In her memoir Hard Choices, Clinton recalls hashing out final details of a plan over drinks with a Chinese official. In June 2010, the United Nations Security Council approved tough new sanctions on Iran -- including expanding an arms embargo and restricting certain financial and shipping enterprises. At the time,Obama called them \"the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government.\" Those sanctions enabled even tougher measures from the United States and the European Union, which were passed immediately. Congress passed several more bills containing additional sanctions on Iran during the rest of Clinton\u2019s tenure, which ended in early 2013. While the Treasury is the primary agency responsible for enforcing sanctions, Clinton appointed a special adviser in 2010 to oversee U.S. efforts \"to ensure full and effective implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Iran, including most recently UNSCR 1929.\" Experts told us that Clinton is correct to take some of the credit for the rapid increase in international sanctions on Iran, and these sanctions were a big part of the reason why Iran rejoined multilateral talks about its nuclear program.

He added that her claim doesn\u2019t give enough credit to other players but is essentially correct. Clawson specifically noted that he is \"not a fan nor a political supporter of Clinton.\" The international sanction ramp-up \"shocked Iran's leaders,\" Clawson said. \"Besides the pain the sanctions inflicted, they raised the possibility more -- worse -- was coming. That was a key factor pushing Iran to resume more serious talks.\" There is room for subjective interpretation on who deserves the credit for effective sanctions because many corners of the U.S. government are involved in the Iran effort, said Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. But the State Department had its hands in every aspect of new sanction-making and implementation, she said. And in the absence of the United Nations resolution -- Clinton\u2019s lobbying success -- it would have been challenging to get a global coalition to significantly ramp up the sanctions, she said. But whether sanctions were a big factor in bringing Iran to the negotiating table is not crystal clear, Maloney said. Iranian officials have historically denied the significance of sanctions, but Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said recently that Iran negotiated the deal specifically to have sanctions lifted. Beyond the multilateral effort, Clinton\u2019s team also played a role in the sanctions that Congress passed, said Richard Nephew, an expert on sanctions with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Lawmakers would not have written that legislation without consulting the State Department and the administration (as evidenced in this 2010 New York Times article). Nephew noted, though, that Congress did pass some sanctions that went further than the administration\u2019s wishes. \"Without SecretaryClinton's good diplomacy -- and the message that she radiated down the system to make this a priority and so forth -- you can argue that the reductions would not have been as steep or as lasting,\" Nephew said. Congress\u2019 sanctions that affect Iran\u2019s oil exports resulted in a 50 percent reduction in oil exports and were instrumental in getting Iran to the negotiating table, said Nephew, who worked at the State Department under Clinton."

The evidence provided in the article supports this claim.\n\nFirstly, the article states that the Chemical Weapons Convention bans the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer or use of chemical weapons, including tear gas. This suggests that tear gas is considered a chemical weapon under international law. However, the convention also allows for the use of riot control agents, including tear gas, for domestic purposes such as controlling riots and maintaining public order. Therefore, while tear gas may be banned in international conflict, it is not prohibited for use within a country.\n\nSecondly, the article highlights that there may be a gray area for use by the military. According to an agreement signed by President Gerald Ford in the 1970s, the United States reserved the right to use tear gas in limited circumstances, such as controlling a riot at a prisoner-of-war detention area. This suggests that there is some flexibility in the use of tear gas for military purposes, even if it is banned in international conflict.\n\nFinally, the article notes that there are few immediate alternatives to tear gas for riot control, and that even though tear gas is far from perfect, it continues to be used in that role because there's nothing else better.

    "doc": "Lawenforcement officers in Ferguson, Mo., have used tear gas extensively in the wake of the police-shooting death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed African-American. The conflict in Ferguson led one PolitiFact reader to ask us to check the accuracy of a social-media meme now circulating that addresses the legality of tear gas. The meme -- posted by the group OurTime.org, an advocacy group for young Americans -- said, \"Tear gas has been classified as a chemical weapon and banned in international conflict since 1993. Why is its use allowed by U.S. police forces?\" The post had garnered 143,000 likes, 42,000 shares, and 35,000 comments by late August. We wanted to know if it was accurate. First, some background on tear gas. It is a broad term for chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pepper spray and CS gas are among the most commonly used. The CDC says that \"prolonged exposure, especially in an enclosed area, may lead to long-term effects such as eye problems including scarring, glaucoma, and cataracts, and may possibly cause breathing problems such as asthma.\" However, the agency adds that \"if symptoms go away soon after a person is removed from exposure to riot control agents, long-term health effects are unlikely to occur.\" Has tear gas been 'banned in international conflict since 1993'? This is close to being accurate. The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer or use of chemical weapons. And tear gas qualifies under the convention as a chemical weapon. Specifically, Article I (5) of the convention says, \"Each State Party undertakes not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare,\" while Article II (7) defines \"riot control agent\" as: \"Any chemical not listed in a Schedule, which can produce rapidly in humans sensory irritation or disabling physical effects which disappear within a short time following termination of exposure.\" The meme is incorrect, however, when it comes to the year the convention came into force. It was finalized in 1993 but took effect on April 29, 1997 -- 180 days after the 65th country, Hungary, ratified the treaty, as the convention set forth. The United States is covered by this provision, the Senate having ratified the convention five days before it went into force. In addition, there may be a gray area for use by the military. When President Gerald Ford signed an earlier, decades-old agreement covering chemicalweapons, the Geneva Gas Protocol of 1925, the United States reserved the right to use tear gas in a limited number of contexts, such as for controlling a riot at a prisoner-of-war detention area -- just not against troops engaged in battle. Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service, said he believes that this limited exception would also hold water under the Chemical Weapons Convention. How relevant is that to police? This part is more murky, because the same convention being touted by the meme\u2019s authors specifically states that lawenforcement use within a country is permitted. \"Law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes\" is \"not prohibited under this convention,\" says Article II (9) (d). This bifurcation between a permitted domestic use and a banned international use is unusual in such accords, said Brian Finlay, managing director of the Stimson Center, a think tank that focuses on global security issues. As for how it happened, there\u2019s a backstory. According to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the international group that helps enforce the Chemical Weapons Convention, riot control agents were \"the topic of long and heated debates\" during negotiations of the convention. In the end, a compromise was reached, the group says, allowing the use of tear gas for riot control but prohibiting it for warfare. Indiana University law professor David P. Fidler, who has studied the issue, said that while there\u2019s been some controversy over what this article of the convention permits in some contexts, \"law enforcement use of tear gas has not been one of them.\" When we contacted OurTime.org, co-founder Jarrett Moreno told us that \"the focus of our post was raising an ethical and moral question: If we can't use tear gas on our enemies, why is it acceptable to use on our own citizens? After Ferguson where we saw children, disabled people, and members of the press being hit with tear gas while exercising their First Amendment rights, why are they being contained with something that we don't even use on the battlefield?\" Experts acknowledged that the treatment of tear gas under the convention is somewhat paradoxical, and it stems in part from horse-trading by convention negotiators. But they added that there are other, more substantive reasons as well. \u2022 The use of any type of gas on a battlefield is problematic. \"Part of the thinking is that soldiers in the field don't have the ability to readily distinguish in the heat of battle if a gas being used is tear gas or something more lethal,\" said Richard Price, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia who has studied the issues. The negotiators, he said, thought that, \"as a practical matter, it was best to ban them all\" on the battlefield. \u2022 There are few immediate alternatives to tear gas for riot control. There are strategies to prevent riots, including better community relations, a less militaristic appearance, and improved training, all of which have been raised in relation to Ferguson. But once rioting is under way, police need tools to control it -- and \"even though tear gas is far from perfect,\" said David A. Koplow, a Georgetown University law professor, \"it continues to be used in that role because there\u2019s nothing else better.\" Israel has deployed an organic riot-control agent dubbed \"skunk water,\" described by a BBC journalist as the \"worst, most foul thing you have ever smelled. An overpowering mix of rotting meat, old socks that haven't been washed for weeks -- topped off with the pungent waft of an open sewer.\" However, it is sprayed from water cannons, which in the popular imagination are associated with their use against civil rights protesters in the 1960s, making them highly unsuitable for use in a scenario like the one in Ferguson. Projectiles such as rubber bullets can be effective, but they can cause serious injury or, if poorly aimed, death. An emerging technology called the Active Denial System -- or more colloquially, the \"pain ray\" -- creates millimeter-wave frequencies that impart a searing sensation of heat on the skin, but amid concerns, the United States military has been slow to adopt it. Meanwhile, new forms of \"incapacitating chemical agents\" that use anesthetic chemicals have been proposed, but they have drawn the concern of such groups as the International Committee of the Red Cross. The problem with new-generation chemical techniques, said Fidler of Indiana University, \"is that their physiological effects are stronger than tear gas, which creates the potential for more injuries and other health harms. Tear gas is well understood as a riot control agent, and it seems to function well enough for law enforcement purposes. \u2022 A lack of desire for change. There is little sign that the convention\u2019s signatories have any desire to reconcile the teargas paradox. \"There is certainly an argument to be made that the fundamental segregation of these two issues is inherently unreasonable,\" said Finlay of the Stimson Center. \"That said, this is very unlikely to change, as it is both a matter of treaty law as well as customary international law today. There is not much appetite among states to alter the status quo.\""

Additionally, Cook's team surveyed a sample of 1,200 authors of the climate reports and found that 97.2 percent of the papers that expressed an opinion on man-made global warming backed the position that it's caused by human activity.\n\nAnother study cited in the article is a January 2009 study by researchers at the University of Illinois, which surveyed 3,146 earth scientists and found that 90 percent of them believed that global warming was occurring and 82 percent said human activities were a key reason. A smaller survey of climate change researchers who actively published their results found that 75 of 77 of them, or 97.4 percent, said human activity is a significant driver of climate change.\n\nThe article also references a National Academy of Sciences study from 2010 that created a database of 908 climate researchers who had their work published at least 20 times in scientific journals. The study found that roughly 90 percent of the climate researchers were convinced that rising temperatures are being caused by human activity, while 10 percent were not convinced. However, the more expertise the researchers had, the greater their consensus.\n\nFinally, a poll of roughly 1,800 meteorologists by the American Meteorological Society found that 73 percent of those surveyed felt that humans contributed to global warming.\n\nTaken together, these studies provide strong evidence for the claim that over 97 percent of the scientific community believes that humans are contributing to climate change. The consensus is based on the broad agreement among actively publishing climate scientists, as well as the consistency of the findings across multiple studies and organizations. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "It\u2019s time to stop debating the science behind whether humans contribute to rising temperatures, says U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-8th. \"Even while over 97 percent of the scientific community and the vast majority of Americans believe that humans are contributing to climate change, a small but well-heeled cohort continues to deny and even try to discredit what objective science tells us unambiguously,\" he wrote in a March 24 post on his congressional website. This Truth-O-Meter will focus on Beyer\u2019s claim that 97 percent of the scientific community believes humans are a cause of climate change - a figure widely cited by those urging efforts to stem global warming. Climate change skeptics repeatedly have said the figure is not credible. We asked Beyer for the source of his statistic. His spokesman, Thomas Scanlon, pointed to several articles in scientific journals, information from NASA, and other sources about climate change. Let\u2019s start with NASA. Here\u2019s what its website says: \"Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position.\" So the federal space agency notes that the 97 percent figure more narrowly focuses on \"actively publishing climate scientists.\" That\u2019s different from Beyer\u2019s broad contention that 97 percent the entire \"scientific community\" thinks humans contribute to global warming. Still, this leaves us with the question: What are the sources for the 97 percent? NASA points to several of them in a footnote on its website. Cook study The first is a 2013 study by John Cook, a fellow at the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland in Australia. He and his co-authors examined 11,944 abstracts of climate science reports published from 1991 to 2011. Two-thirds of the abstracts didn\u2019t express any opinion about whether man-made global warming was occurring. But among the roughly 4,000 studies that did, 97.1 percent of them \"endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming,\" the report says. Cook also asked a sample of 1,200 authors of the climate reports to rate their own papers and say whether their research agreed that global warming was man-made. The result was that 97.2 percent of the papers that expressed an opinion about man-made global warming backed the position that it\u2019s caused by human activity. Cook\u2019s methodology has been criticized. Tol study Richard Tol, a professor with the Institute for Environmental Studies in Amsterdam, rejects the 97 percent figure. In a 2014 article, he said it was based on an unrepresentative sample of climate science papers that took into account only one-quarter of the climate research available. Tol had other misgivings about the Australian researcher\u2019s methodology. In re-running the figures, Tol found that some 91 percent of climate research papers that Cook\u2019s team examined supported the consensus that man is the main reason for the Earth\u2019s warming temperatures. Despite taking aim at the specificity of the 97 percent figure, Tol said he agrees there indeed is a large consensus that warming temperatures are the result of human activity. \"There is no doubt in my mind that the literature on climate change overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by humans,\" Tol wrote. \"I have very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct. Cook et al., however, failed to demonstrate this.\" In a reply, Cook re-examined the data and stood by his paper\u2019s conclusions in a 2014 post on his blog, Skeptical Science. University of Illinois study Beyond this debate, NASA also cites a January 2009 study by researchers at the University of Illinois. They surveyed 3,146 earth scientists and asked two questions: Was global warming occurring? Was human activity a \"significant contributing factor\" for changes in the Earth\u2019s temperatures? Nine out of 10 of the scientists said the Earth\u2019s temperatures had risen, and 82 percent said human activities were a key reason. Winnowing the field to climate change researchers who actively published their results, the survey found that 75 of 77 of them, or 97.4 percent, said human activity is a significant driver of climate change. That latter figure also has come under criticism because of its small sample size. National Academy of Sciences Another study published in 2010 by the National Academy of Sciences created a database of 908 climate researchers who had their work published at least 20 times in scientific journals. The study found roughly 90 percent of the climate researchers were convinced that rising temperatures are being caused by human activity, while 10 percent were not convinced. But the more expertise the researchers had, the greater their consensus. Looking at the top 200 researchers, based on the number of articles they published, just 2.5 percent of them were unconvinced climate change was mostly the result of human activity, the study found. That left \"97\u201398% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field surveyed\" convinced that rising temperatures were mostly due to humans, the report said. Conversely, the study found that the expertise of researchers who weren\u2019t convinced of man-made global warming was \"substantially below that of the convinced researchers.\" Bill Anderegg, the PNAS report\u2019s lead author, told us in an email that \"the quote from (Beyer) is absolutely consistent with the scientific literature on this.\" We also found a 2013 poll of roughly 1,800 meteorologists by the American Meteorological Society found that 73 percent of those surveyed felt that humans contributed to global warming. But for the more active publishing climate science experts within that group, 93 percent believed that humans were contributing to global warming."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, it can be argued that the claim that CIA Director George Tenet told the Bush administration that the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack was coming is false. The article text and the special commission created to investigate the attacks indicate that while there was a lot of chatter about potential attacks in the months leading up to 9/11, there was no specific information that indicated an imminent attack on U.S. soil.\n\nFirstly, the article text states that \"the system was blinking red\" in the months before the September 2001 attacks, indicating a high level of urgency and threat reports. However, despite this, there were doubters within the intelligence community, including Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, who thought perhaps Osama bin Ladin was trying to study U.S. reactions. Tenet shot down this idea, suggesting that there was no specific information indicating an imminent attack.\n\nFurthermore, the special commission's timeline revealed a consensus that the target lay outside America's borders, with one prominent exception - an Aug. 6 briefing document written by two CIA analysts. This document stated that bin Laden said he wanted to attack the United States directly and was expected to plan patiently, and mentioned suspicious surveillance of federal buildings in New York. However, as the commission report notes, this document did not lead to any meetings of the interagency Counterterrorism Security Group or the National Security Council to discuss a domestic attack.\n\nFinally, the commission interviewed George W. Bush as part of its investigation and included his response to the briefing document. Bush stated that the August 6 report was historical in nature and that he had known about bin Laden's desire to attack America since he became President. He also mentioned that 70 investigations were underway in the United States, which suggests that while there was concern about potential attacks, there was no specific information indicating an imminent attack on U.S. soil.\n\nBased on these points, it can be argued that the claim that CIA Director George Tenet told the Bush administration that the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack was coming is false. There is no evidence to support this claim, and the available evidence suggests that while there was concern about potential attacks in the months leading up to 9/11, there was no specific information indicating an imminent attack on U.S. soil.",
    "doc": "The war of words between GOP presidential hopefuls Jeb Bush and Donald Trump continues, with the most recent clash coming over the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the response of Bush\u2019s brother, President George W. Bush. Jeb Bush has stated several times that his brother kept America safe. Trump said that ignores a crucial fact -- that George W. Bush failed to stop the Sept. 11 attacks. Worse yet, Trump said on Oct. 20, 2015, that Bush knew the 2001 attacks were coming. \"His brother could have made some mistakes with respect to the actual hit because they did know it was coming and George Tenet, the head of the CIA, told them it was coming,\" Trump said on CNN\u2019s New Day. \"So they did have advanced notice and they didn\u2019t really work on it.\" Our question here is simple: Did Tenet and the CIA tell the Bush administration that an attack on U.S. soil was imminent? The answer comes from a special commission created to investigate the Sept. 11 attacks. (Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.) \u2018The system was blinking red\u2019 Tenet told staff for the commission, formally the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States, that \"the system was blinking red\" in the months before the September2001 attacks. \"Threat reports surged in June and July, reaching an even higher peak of urgency,\" the commission report said. \"The summer threats seemed to be focused on Saudi Arabia, Israel, Bahrain, Kuwait, Yemen, and possibly Rome, but the danger could be anywhere -- including a possible attack on the G-8 summit in Genoa.\" Despite the chatter, there were doubters. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz thought perhaps Osama bin Ladin was trying to study U.S. reactions. Tenet shot that down. The report said that on Aug. 3, 2001, \"the intelligence community issued an advisory concluding that the threat of impending al Qaeda attacks would likely continue indefinitely. Citing threats in the Arabian Peninsula, Jordan, Israel, and Europe, the advisory suggested that al Qaeda was lying in wait and searching for gaps in security before moving forward with the planned attacks.\" The commission\u2019s timeline revealed a consensus that the target lay outside America\u2019s borders. The one prominent exception came in an Aug. 6 briefing document written by two CIA analysts. They titled it \"Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in US.\" Essentially, the briefing document stated that bin Laden said he wanted to attack the United States directly and was expected to plan patiently. It spoke of an unconfirmed warning from 1998 that planes might be hijacked to win the release of imprisoned extremists and noted suspicious surveillance of federal buildings in New York. It noted that 70 investigations were underway in the United States. The closest it came to what actually took place was \"CIA and the FBI are investigating a call to our Embassy in the UAE in May saying that a group of Bin Ladin supporters was in the US planning attacks with explosives.\" What Bush knew The commission interviewed George W. Bush as part of its investigation and included his response to the briefing document. They write: \"The President told us the August 6 report was historical in nature. President Bush said the article told him that al Qaeda was dangerous, which he said he had known since he had become President. The President said Bin Ladin had long been talking about his desire to attack America. He recalled some operational data on the FBI, and remembered thinking it was heartening that 70 investigations were under way. As best he could recollect, (National Security Adviser Condoleeza) Rice had mentioned that the Yemenis' surveillance of a federal building in New York had been looked into in May and June, but there was no actionable intelligence.\" The commission report goes on to say that the briefing document led to no meetings of the interagency Counterterrorism Security Group or the National Security Council to discuss a domestic attack. Tenet met with Bush two more times in August and on Sept. 10. Tenet said he didn\u2019t remember talking to Bush about a domestic threat. News reports since 2004 have described in detail the frustrations intelligence officials like Tenet had in trying to get the White House to focus on Bin Ladin. But none suggest that Tenet thought a domestic strike was likely. Brian Finlay,president of the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank, said the Aug. 6 article contained no specific information that would have \"prevented the tragedy of that day.\" \"One would have to willingly suspend disbelief to presume that any American official responsible for the national security of our country would have failed to act in the face of clear evidence of an imminent attack,\" Finlay said. Trump\u2019s accusation \"is simply off-base,\" Finlay said."

This is evident in his statement in the audiobook: \"If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, people like me would go in and buy like crazy.\" Similarly, during the CNN interview in 2009, Trump stated that he believed the economic situation was a \"great opportunity\" for investors to purchase properties.\n\nThe evidence presented does not indicate that Trump actively rooted for the housing crisis or took any steps to exacerbate it. Rather, it suggests that he saw an opportunity for profit during a time of economic instability and expressed his business-oriented perspective. Therefore, the label \"True\" is a fitting classification for the claim based on the provided evidence.",
    "doc": "In the opening skirmish of the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton cast her rival as a man who put his own business interests ahead of the welfare of average Americans. \"Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis,\" Clinton said. \"He said back in 2006, \u2018Gee, I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.\u2019 What does the record show? We found many examples from 2006 to 2009 when Donald Trump spoke of the \"great opportunity\" that came with falling real estate prices. One of the earliest instances was in a Trump audiobook from 2006. The man interviewing Trump for the audiobook says, \"There's a lot of talk, which you've no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What's your take on that pessimism?\" \"Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy. You know, if you're in a good cash position \u2014 which I'm in a good cash position today \u2014 then people like me would go in and buy like crazy,\" he says in a portion of the audiobook posted by CNN. \"If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money.\" Now that was before the collapse that led to the Great Recession, and arguably, Trump was simply offering sound business guidance. Trump touted the same view a couple of times in 2007. But at that point, the country still was not looking at an economic catastrophe. The situation was quite different by early 2009. The investment house Lehman Brothers had filed for bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history. The Dow had suffered its worst weekly loss ever. Washington had bailed out General Motors and Chrysler. Foreclosures were rising weekly. Trump was on CNN Feb. 17, 2009, talking about the economy with host Wolf Blitzer and said the moment was a \"great opportunity.\" Blitzer asked Trump why. \"If you get something really prime, really good, eventually it's going to be worth a lot more than you paid,\" Trump explained. \"I used to tell people two years ago, don't buy real estate and I used to preach it hard. And now I'm saying, I think that this is a good time. Whether you hit the exact market or not, I can't tell you. But I think this is a great time to buy. If you have cash, this is the great time to buy.\" To be clear, Trump was speaking as an investor. He was not necessarily rooting for the housing crisis. But it was under way as he spoke. We reached out to the Trump campaign and did not receive any information to add to this picture."

Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate.",
    "doc": "Congress headed home for its six-week, pre-election break on Sept. 22, after the U.S. Senate voted just past midnight to give final approval to a short-term budget measure that will keep the federal government running for another six months.The decision to approve a short-term budget fix instead of passing a spending plan for the entire fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 again set off a debate about whether lawmakers were acting irresponsibly.\"We haven\u2019t passed a budget in more than three years and not a single appropriations bill has been brought to the floor this year,\" U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said in a press release explaining why he voted against the short-term measure.Corker argued Congress should not be passing the short-term measure, known as a continuing resolution, or any spending bill until it has prioritized how taxpayer dollars are to be spent and at what levels.\"If the Senate can\u2019t perform its most basic responsibilities,\" Corker said, \"I worry about how we\u2019re going to make the tough decisions and do the hard work that will be necessary to get our country on a path to fiscal solvency.\"To back up the senator\u2019s claim about congressional inaction on a budget and spending bills, Corker\u2019s office pointed us to two documents compiled by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee.The first was a timeline indicating that the last time the Democratic-led Senate passed a budget was on April 29, 2009. The other document was a status report on all 12 of the annual spending bills that provide funding for federal departments and agencies. According to that document, not one of the 12 spending bills has been considered by the full Senate this year.Corker is not the first Republican to take the Democratic-led Senate to task for failing to pass a budget. PolitiFact and its partners in other states have examined at least five similar claims in the past, and rulings on those have varied because the statements were worded differently.When statements attempted to pin the blame squarely on just one political party for the inaction, rulings of Half True were given. But in a case where blame was not heaped on just one party, as is the case with Corker\u2019s statement, PolitiFact has gone with True or Mostly True, depending on the wording of the claim.In any case, each of those statements cited the same date \u2013 April 29, 2009 \u2013 as the last time a budget had been approved.An April 26, 2012, item from PolitiFact Ohio explained how the budget process is supposed to work:Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring. These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years. If these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise.Budget resolutions are policy plans. They are not appropriations bills, or spending bills, which actually allocate money for specific purposes.If a budget resolution doesn\u2019t pass, the federal government won\u2019t go dark. In the absence of a budget resolution, appropriations bills have continued to allocate money. What about Corker\u2019s claim that not a single appropriations bill has been brought to the Senate floor this year?The U.S. House passed seven of the 12 annual appropriations bills this year and sent them to the Senate for consideration, according to the status report by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee also approved 11 of the 12 spending bills and sent them to the full Senate for consideration.An independent search by PolitiFact via the Library of Congress\u2019 Thomas bill-tracking web site confirmed the figures cited in the GOP report.But none of the bills approved by the House or the Senate Appropriations Committee were ever brought to the Senate floor for a vote. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who decides which bills will be considered, told reporters on July 10, 2012, that no spending bills were likely to be approved this year because of an ongoing dispute with House Republicans over how much the federal government should spend.True to his word, Reid so far has not brought any of the annual spending bills to the floor this year, necessitating the short-term budget measure to keep the government running for another six months.Previous PolitiFact items on claims like this also have brought this perspective -- there have been times when Republicans have been in charge and also have failed to pass a budget.Our colleagues at PolitiFact Florida report that the House and the Senate had failed to pass a joint budget bill on four other occasions since 1983.For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, under Democratic control in 2002, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind. For fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007, the House and the Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In these latter three cases, the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress."

    "doc": "U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, the Indian Shores Republican incumbent of 42 years, touts his credibility with seniors in a TV spotclearly aimed at the 65-plus crowd.An ensemble of older men and women, and even former Gov. Jeb Bush, praise Young for being there for seniors.\"Florida seniors couldn\u2019t have a bigger champion than Congressman Bill Young,\" Bush says.Amid the endorsements are claims about Young\u2019s record on Social Security, the Medicare prescription drug program, support for a balanced budget amendment, and, of course, Medicare.\"Young opposed $716-billion cut to Medicare,\" bold text shows.Below that text is a citation: \"House Roll Call Vote 165 - 3/21/2010.\"It\u2019s the House vote on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which Young voted against. Does that mean he rejected \"the $716 billion cut to Medicare?\"We also checked a dueling Medicare claim from his challenger, Democratic lawyer Jessica Ehrlich, over whether he voted for the Ryan budgets that \"end the current Medicare system.\"The $716 billion cutYou could say we\u2019ve heard this line a time or two.This attack line is a viral one in the political world, used by Mitt Romney against President Barack Obama, Rep. Connie Mack against Sen. Bill Nelson, and in many, many, many other races across the country.It\u2019s not a \"cut\" in the traditional sense. Medicare is an open-ended entitlement program with a growth problem that threatens its future viability. Both parties agree changes should be made.Obama did not propose a cut to Medicare\u2019s budget in his health care law. Rather, the law made several changes to slow the growth of Medicare costs. These changes primarily affected insurance companies and hospitals -- not beneficiaries.The government, for example, will pay hospitals less if they have too many readmissions or fail to meet new benchmarks for care. The law also deals with Medicare Advantage, which is a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers started under President George W. Bush with the goal of reducing costs through marketplace competition. The plans have actually proven more expensive than traditional Medicare in recent years, so the health care law aims to reduce payments to private insurers as a way to rein in costs.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determinedin 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimatereleased this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.It\u2019s worth pointing out Young could not have known he was specifically voting against $716 billion in Medicare \"cuts,\" as that had not been tabulated in time for the health care vote that happened two years earlier.Still, it was known at the bill\u2019s passage that there were major reductions in store for Medicare service providers, said economist Gail Wilensky, senior fellow at the international health foundation Project HOPE and Medicare director under President George H.W. Bush.A tricky point for Young\u2019s claim is that he also voted for the budget blueprint of Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- twice, actually. The budget is a congressional resolution that does not carry the force of law, and Ryan\u2019s ideas have not been turned into detailed legislation.Even so, Ryan has saidhis most recent budget factors in the same $716 billion in reductions in Medicare spending.Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter made this point on Face the Nation in August, saying Ryan \"protected those cuts in his budget.\" PolitiFact rated her statement True.The Romney campaign responded to Cutter\u2019s remark with a statement that Romney intended to repeal the health care law and end the Medicare \"raid.\"Ryan said he factored the $716 billion savings in his budget it \"was already in the baseline,\" the Wall Street Journal reported. \"We would never have done it in the first place.\" However, his budget assumed reversal of other Obama spending decisions, the Journal pointed out.A month later, former President Bill Clinton reprised the attack in his Democratic National Convention speech, quipping, \"it takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did.\" We rated it True.Ehrlich\u2019s positionEhrlich is in an interesting spot here. She, too, opposes this \"cut.\"Even though she supports the health care law, she told the Tampa Bay Times, \"I am against the $500 billion cuts to Medicare in both the Affordable Care Act and the Ryan budget. I also oppose the Independent Panel Advisory Board in the Affordable Care Act and would support legislation to overturn that provision.\"She has attacked Young for voting for the Ryan budgets that reshape how Medicare works.When we asked her to elaborate on her position in an interview, she said she wanted to keep Medicare \"fully funded.\"\"I think we have to maintain the integrity of the program, make sure that it\u2019s fully funded, and not advocate for cutting until we look at the budget as a whole,\" she said.She did not provide specifics for reducing the program\u2019s spending. Young said she could not have had it both ways if she were a member of Congress at the time of the vote. \"If you voted for the bill, you voted for the Medicare cut,\" he said."

Furthermore, other resources such as hiring and maintaining existing levels of Border Patrol agents and customs officers, as well as communication and aerial surveillance equipment, have also been used to enhance border control.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is not accurate to say that the president is flagrantly defying the 2006 federal law.

    "doc": "In a searing call to action that appeared in the conservative Daily Caller, the NRA\u2019s Wayne LaPierre encouraged Americans to arm themselves, join the NRA and recruit others in preparation against the growing threats of terrorism, economic instability and the policies of the Obama administration.\"It has always been sensible for good citizens to own and carry firearms for lawful protection against violent criminals who prey on decent people,\" LaPierre wrote. \"During the second Obama term, however, additional threats are growing.\"He cited drug gangs and other criminals who enter the United States through the southern border. They get in, LaPierre said, because \"the president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border.\"Flagrant defiance? We decided to examine whether it\u2019s true that President Barack Obama is bucking a law requiring construction of a such a fence.Secure Fence Act of 2006We did not hear back from the NRA for this story. But the 2006 law directing fence construction is the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican-led Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. It authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along the border with Mexico. The act specified \"at least two layers of reinforced fencing.\"One thing it did not do: require a fence to be built \"along the entire Mexican border,\" as LaPierre claimed. Instead, it directed that specific segments of the border -- \"extending from 10 miles west of the Tecate, California, port of entry to 10 miles east of the Tecate, California, port of entry,\" for example -- be double-fenced. The fenced segments totaled roughly 650-700 miles, while the entire U.S.-Mexican border is about 2,000 miles long.Obama, an Illinois senator at the time, voted for the law.The following year, the legislation underwent a significant change. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security argued that different border terrains required different types of fencing -- that a one-size-fits-all approach across the entire border didn't make sense.Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, proposed an amendment to give DHS the discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read, \"nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.\"In other words, Border Patrol would use its discretion to decide which type of fencing was appropriate in various regions. The amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007.Hutchison said at the time, \"Border patrol agents reported that coyotes and drug-runners were altering their routes as fencing was deployed, so the amendment gives our agents discretion to locate the fence where necessary to achieve operational control of our border.\" Opponents, however, said the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill.Today, DHS says Border Patrol has completed 651 miles of fencing, including 299 miles of vehicle fence and 352 miles of primary pedestrian fence. One mile of pedestrian fence is left to complete, and it is tied up in litigation.So what\u2019s being flagrantly defied?That comes down to the difference between vehicle fence and pedestrian fence, as well as the \"double layer\" specification in the 2006 law.On the one hand, the fence is virtually complete and in compliance with the 2007 amendment.\"It cost almost $3 million per mile to construct that fence. Including maintenance, it is supposed to cost over $6 billion over the next 20 years. President Obama is going above and beyond any president ever at enforcing our immigration laws,\" said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.On the other, it\u2019s not the fence envisioned in 2006. For one thing, vehicle fencing would be more accurately described as posts placed close enough together that cars can\u2019t be driven between them.What\u2019s more, just 36.3 miles of fencing are double-layered.Said Rosemary Jenks with Numbers USA, a Washington group that favors low levels of immigration: \"The Secure Fence Act called for 650 miles of double-layer pedestrian fencing. While the administration claims to have completed 650 miles of fencing, virtually none of it is double layer, and several hundred miles is vehicle barriers, instead of fence at all.\"Other resources, practical considerationsWhile LaPierre was specific about fence construction, we thought we\u2019d mention other aspects of border control.Rey Koslowski, in a 2011 paper for the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Southwest Border Security Act Obama signed in 2010 appropriated $600 million for enhanced border protection on top of the president\u2019s July 2010 authorization to deploy 1,200 National Guard troops to the border. The largest share of the additional funding, $244 million, was to hire and maintain existing levels of Border Patrol agents and customs officers. Almost $200 million went to the Department of Justice to hire more federal law enforcement officers for the southwest border region, and still millions more went to communications and aerial surveillance equipment.In an interview, Koslowski pointed out that the 2006 law required that no more than 18 months after its enactment the government should have \"operational control\" of the border. How was that defined? \"The prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States.\"\"Well, guess what, they failed,\" Koslowski said. \"Under this definition, no country, not even East Germany, managed operational control like this.\"So the fence -- pedestrian and vehicle -- is an adaptation to changing immigration patterns, from population centers where people used to walk in, out to deserts and mountains where they drive across.Added Gordon Hanson, an economist at University of California, San Diego: \"It simply doesn\u2019t make economic sense to build a fence along the entire border; in desert/mountain regions there are far more efficient ways to block entry than a fence in the middle of nowhere.\""

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The claim \"Amazing fact: Senate has already voted on more amendments in 2015 than Reid allowed ALL YEAR last year\" is true based on the evidence provided. According to the article, there were 16 roll call votes on amendments in 2014 and as of January 22nd, 2015, there had been 17 more votes on amendments to the bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. This means that there have been more votes on amendments in less than a month under new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell than in all of 2014 under former Majority Leader Harry Reid. The reason behind this difference is attributed to Reid's use of a procedural tactic called \"filling the amendment tree\" which allowed for fewer amendments to be heard on the floor, while McConnell has allowed more amendments to be voted on. Experts suggest that while this change may indicate a shift towards more cooperative policymaking, it is too early to determine whether this will lead to easier passage of amendments for Democrats.",
    "doc": "There\u2019s a new sheriff in charge of the U.S. Senate, and he\u2019s eager to show how he\u2019s shaking up the law of the land. We\u2019re talking, of course, about new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who took over the Senate\u2019s top slot after the midterm elections bounced Democrats from power. And in this new world, Republicans are touting an eye-catching factoid as evidence of a functional Senate, one they say runs on fairness and order under GOP control. \"Amazing fact: Senate has already voted on more amendments in 2015 than Reid allowed ALL YEAR last year,\" tweeted Phil Kerpen, opinion-writer and president of conservative 501(c)(4) American Commitment, on Jan. 22, 2015. Kerpen, formerly of Americans for Prosperity, theClub for Growth and the libertarian Cato Institute, told us he heard the statistic from McConnell himself. We wanted to know if it was true that the Senate has already allowed more votes on amendments in less than one month than all of 2014. And why? On Senate stoppage and filled \u2018trees\u2019 The simple answer on the numberof votes is that Kerpen is correct. But the reason behind it varies depending on your particular political lens. A simple search of Senate roll call votes on amendments in 2014 and 2015 backs up Kerpen\u2019s statement. In 2014, there were 15 roll call votes on amendments. As of Jan. 22, 2015, the date of Kerpen's tweet, there were 16 roll call votes on amendments. There have since been 17 more votes on amendments to the bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which passed a week later but will likely face President Barack Obama\u2019s veto pen. Kerpen came at the tally a different way, counting \"real\" votes on amendments, a distinction that also includes roll call votes on motions to table amendments, which effectively kills them. By his math, there were 16 votes allowed on amendments in 2014 and 26 so far in 2015. By either count, the numbers work. What changed? In 2014, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., relied on a funny-sounding procedure called \"filling the amendment tree.\" Basically, Reid filled the docket allowed for amendments by adding amendments with inconsequential changes that no one else could override. The procedural tactic prevented Republican-sponsored amendments from being heard on the floor. \"He did that more than any of his predecessors,\" Donald Ritchie, Senate historian, told PunditFact. Reid wasn\u2019t doing this just to be a not-so-nice guy. To Democrats, it was to counter Republican tactics. Unlike the House, the Senate does not have strict rules for the substance of amendments that can be attached to bills (i.e., you could add a health care amendment onto a defense spending bill). And that\u2019s exactly what happened in years past. Republicans began introducing off-topic amendments that, for example, cut off U.S. aid to Egypt or, a favorite of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., to eliminate health care subsidies for Senate staffers. No matter what the topic of the bill. Sometimes this was in effort to force difficult votes for Democrats back home. To Republicans, Reid\u2019s style of blocking amendments emulated an uncooperative and off-the-rails leadership style -- one that is tremendously well-documented -- that stymied policymaking. To Democrats, it was necessary to get anything accomplished. Republicans were filibustering votes on the underlying bills and not committing to a vote in exchange for allowing some amendments, said Steven S. Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis. \"Reid saw they were filibustering everything, bringing the place to a standstill,\" Smith told us. \"So he wondered why he should give them votes at all.\" Reid\u2019s office does not dispute the number of votes on amendments, but they do take issue with what they deem an \"empty talking point\" that neglects Republican responsibility for the gridlock. His spokesman argues that Republicans blocked their own share of amendments by not compromising on potential amendments to be heard on the floor and refusing to come to an agreement about when a bill should come to a vote. \"(Reid) makes no apologies for blocking what we all consider to be extremely pointless political amendments that were just designed not to improve the bills we were working on but to run 30-second political ads against Democratic senators,\" said spokesman Adam Jentleson. \"Republicans are entirely culpable in that number being what it is.\" Reid\u2019s style of blocking amendments irritated Republicans, sure, but it also flared up during the 2014 midterms with Republicans using it to attack Democrats. The GOP pounced on Alaska Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Begich, for instance, for his lack of roll-call votes on his amendments. McConnell, conversely, said he would allow open amendments on the Keystone XL bill, hence the GOP celebrating its \"new management\" style. As political experts told us to expect, there have already been clashes with McConnell\u2019s methods a few days after the initial celebration. During the Keystone debate, Democrats objected to McConnell tabling Democratic amendments and not letting Democrats debate their amendments for a minute. Reid, perhaps ironically, tweeted, \"I've never seen debate shut down as aggressively as when Sen. McConnell refused to allow Dems to debate their own amendments for just 1 min. ... and that\u2019s saying something.\" What the experts tell us Bottom line, experts said, voters shouldn\u2019t take the new tactics as evidence that McConnell\u2019s \"return to normal order\" will give the Democrats an easy path to voting on the amendments of their choice. \"It\u2019s not going to happen,\" said Roy Meyers, University of Maryland, Baltimore County affiliate professor of public policy. University of Kansas political science professor Burdett Loomis agreed, saying, \"The overall idea isn\u2019t trivial (\u2018regular order\u2019), but the exact number isn\u2019t very significant, especially if McConnell, as expected, runs the Senate almost completely to the (Republicans\u2019) advantage.\" It\u2019s too early to know whether we have a \"sea change\" of order on our hands in the Senate, said Sarah Binder, George Washington University political science professor. \"In other words, the intense partisanship of the Senate that led Sen. Reid to all-but shut down the amendment process last year has not dissipated,\" Binder said. \"I think the question going forward is whether McConnell can find a way to conduct the Senate such that senators from both parties believe their legislative needs are being met.\""

The tweet cites the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the source of the data, which shows that there were 70,237 drug overdose deaths across the country in 2017, with 2,989 overdose deaths in Texas. The tweet also notes that opioids were involved in 67.8% of drug overdose deaths nationwide and 48.8% of deaths in Texas.\n\nHowever, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the claim made by Senator Cornyn does not take into account the population size of Texas compared to other states. While Texas had a relatively high number of drug overdose deaths in 2017, when considering the rate of drug-related deaths per capita, Texas lands near the bottom of the list with 10.5 overdose deaths per 100,000 people. This suggests that while Texas may be severely impacted by drug trafficking in terms of sheer numbers, it is not necessarily the most severely impacted state when considering the rate of drug-related deaths per capita.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, the claim made by Senator Cornyn that Texas remains one of the most severely impacted states from drug trafficking is accurate, but it should be noted that the ranking of Texas in terms of overdose deaths per capita is more nuanced and depends on how the data is analyzed.",
    "doc": "U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, posted a series of tweets about drug overdose deaths ahead of a hearing held by the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control on federal efforts to counter drug abuse and trafficking. One of the Republican\u2019s tweets was about his home state of Texas and included an image that showed the number of drug-related deaths in Texas and in the United States in 2017 (3,000 in Texas and 70,000 across the country). \"Texas remains one of the most severely impacted states from drug trafficking,\" Cornyn said. \"Nearly 3,000 Texans died from drug related deaths in 2017 \u2013 with half being overdoses involving opioids.\" We decided to fact-check this claim, which originated from Cornyn\u2019s opening statement at the Senate hearing. Understanding Cornyn\u2019s tweet Drew Brandewie, a spokesman for Cornyn, said the tweet was based on the senator\u2019s opening statement at the Senate Drug Caucus hearing, which included additional context about the first half of the claim. \"My home state of Texas remains one of the most severely impacted states in terms of volume of trafficking and all related mayhem that accompanies the illicit activity,\" Cornyn said at the hearing, before offering the same statistics included in his tweet. Cornyn\u2019s tweet doesn\u2019t include the extra note that Texas is one of the most severely impacted states \"in terms of volume of trafficking and all related mayhem\" \u2014 which could include several categories of data. (Brandewie said the number of overdose deaths in the state was an example of related mayhem.) Instead, Cornyn\u2019s tweet as-written suggests that his claim is just in reference to the number of overdose deaths in the state. This is the perspective we used to fact-check his claim, but we considered the context from the hearing when issuing our ruling. With this in mind, Cornyn\u2019s figures are accurate, but his ranking of Texas as one of the most impacted states in terms of overdose deaths is based on totals that haven\u2019t been adjusted for population size. Federal figures are in line with numbers Cornyn shared The image Cornyn shared with his tweet cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Brandewie confirmed via email that CDC figures were the basis of Cornyn\u2019s tweet. Numbers published by the agency mirror the figures in Cornyn\u2019s tweet: In 2017, there were 70,237 drug overdose deaths across the country and 2,989 overdose deaths in Texas. Looking just at overdose deaths in 2017, opioids were involved in 67.8% of deaths nationwide and 48.8% of deaths in Texas. While looking at these numbers, it\u2019s worth considering the fact that not all drug overdose deaths are tied to drug trafficking Courtney Lenard, spokeswoman for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the CDC, provided an analysis of mortality data that showed prescription opioids are associated with opioid overdose deaths. \"Correct, not all drug-related deaths are related to illicit drugs,\" Lenard said. \"However, illicit drugs \u2013 particularly illicitly-manufactured fentanyl \u2013 are largely driving the overdose epidemic in more recent years.\" She said separate analyses conducted by the CDC using mortality data and drug seizure data from the Drug Enforcement Administration \"have suggested an association between states with high or increasing numbers of fentanyl encounters and increases in overdose deaths involving fentanyl.\" How do drug overdose deaths in Texas compare with other states? Cornyn\u2019s tweet connects the number of drug overdose deaths in Texas in 2017 to the state\u2019s status as one of the states most severely impacted by drug trafficking, but does that check out? In 2017, there were 2,989 drug-related deaths in Texas, making it the state with the sixth highest number of overdose deaths that year, behind New York (3,921), California (4,868), Florida (5,088), Ohio (5,111) and Pennsylvania (5,388). But given that Texas is the second most populous state, it makes more sense to consider the rate of drug-related deaths per capita than to compare raw totals by state. If we look at the number of drug-related deaths per capita by state, Texas lands near the bottom of the list with 10.5 overdose deaths per 100,000 people. Just three states have a lower number of overdose deaths per capita: North Dakota (9.2), South Dakota (8.5) and Nebraska (8.1). The state with the most drug-related deaths per capita in 2017 was West Virginia, with 57.8 deaths per 100,000 total population, or 974 overdose deaths in total."

The evidence provided in the article contradicts Perry's statement, and it is clear that he was mistaken when he made this claim.",
    "doc": "Rick Perry roused reporters at the White House the other day by taking multiple questions including an inquiry prompting the former governor to make a curious two-part claim about France. Reporter:\"Can you assure the American people that nuclear waste and nuclear plant safety are such that we should expand nuclear power in this country?\u2019 U.S. Energy Secretary Perry: \"You know, I would reflect that -- or deflect that, if he was here, to President (Emmanuel) Macron of France, who gets 70-plus percent of their power from nuclear energy.\" \"Now,\" Perry went on, \"this is the country that wouldn\u2019t buy Texas beef for some reason, yet 76 percent of their energy comes from nuclear power. So the French, who I\u2019ve always thought were a little bit different -- (laughter) -- and that\u2019s in a good way. You know, they recognized us as a state back in the 1830s, so we actually have a really close, personal relationship with the French. We like them. We had an embassy in Paris. They had one in Austin; as a matter of fact it\u2019s still there, called the French Legation. Invite all of you to come and see it. \"But the French are a little different when it comes to some things. And one of those I would find it really interesting -- our French friends are very comfortable getting 76 percent, thereabouts, of their energy from nuclear, and I can assure you they\u2019re very fond of getting it at the rate they\u2019re getting it.\" Perry was surely referring to France\u2019s official recognition of the Republic of Texas. The country also had a diplomat placed in Austin who intended to live in a building that\u2019s still in place just east of downtown Austin, the French Legation Museum, though that didn\u2019t work out. Perry\u2019s juxtaposition of beef, nuclear power and France made us wonder. That is, have the French refused to buy Texas beef and does France also rely on nuclear power for 76 percent of its energy? Boeuf? After unsuccessfully asking the Energy Department for Perry\u2019s factual backup, we chewed on Perry\u2019s beef beef by reaching Joe Schuele of the U.S. Meat Export Federation. Schuele told us the entire European Union has banned imports of beef produced with growth hormones for nearly three decades. As of 2017, France ranked among the EU\u2019s 28 member- nations. A U.S. Department of Agriculture web page, \"Export Requirements for the European Union,\" presents multiple conditions for animal products shipped to EU countries. A portion states: \"All bovine meat exported to the European Union must originate from animals that have never been treated with hormonal growth promotants.\" Then again, Schuele advised that the EU still imports beef not produced with growth hormones--including about 16,000 metric tons of it, valued at $264 million, in 2016, perhaps some of that making it to France. Mindful that Perry led Texas from late 2000 into 2014, we asked about the timing of the EU\u2019s beef limits. The ban on beef produced with growth hormones, he said, traces to 1989, when the EU was the European Economic Community. That roped off many U.S. beef producers, according to a 2015 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: \"In the United States, hormones have been approved for use since the 1950s and are now believed to be used on approximately two-thirds of all cattle and about 90% of the cattle on feedlots. In large U.S. commercial feedlots, their use approaches 100%,\" the report said. \"Cattle producers use hormones because they allow animals to grow larger and more quickly on less feed and fewer other inputs, thus reducing production costs, but also because they produce a leaner carcass more in line with consumer preferences for diets with reduced fat and cholesterol,\" CRS said. In 2009, years after the U.S. successfully challenged the EU limits before the World Trade Organization, Schuele said, the U.S. and EU agreed to annual quotas of duty-free beef exports. Any beef shipped in excess of the quota, Schuele said, faces a duty amounting to 20 percent of the shipment\u2019s invoiced value on arrival. A USDA spokeswoman, Kari Heerman, separately emailed us similar background, also pointing out the agency\u2019s Non-Hormone Treated Cattle Program, which regulates beef shipped to the EU. Heerman said by email: \"France does import beef from the United States, but it does not import beef treated with hormones that are commonly used throughout North America.\" But, Heerman said, \"we do not have data to determine whether/how much of the beef that is exported to France comes from Texas.\" Heerman said data on \"beef flows\" or exports from each state aren\u2019t collected. Summing up, Schuele wrote: \"So while the EU doesn\u2019t exactly refuse to buy U.S. beef, only a small percentage of U.S. beef is eligible for export to the EU.\" Nuclear power We turned next to whether 76 percent of France\u2019s powercomes from nuclear plants. A web search led us to an International Atomic Energy Agency web page indicating that in 2016, France drew 72 percent of its electricityfrom 58 nuclear power plants. Our click on the page\u2019s \"trend\" button on the page yielded a graph suggesting that since 1997, nuclear power has come close to accounting for 80 percent of France\u2019s powerproduction. France\u2019s Share of Power Production Attributed to Nuclear Plants, 1997-2016 SOURCE: Web page, \"France,\" Power Reactor Information System, International Atomic Energy Agency, last updated June 28, 2017 Otherwise Jonathan Cobb of the World Nuclear Association replied to our email inquiry by pointing us to a web page overseen by the Paris-based International Energy Agency, whose 29 member-nations collectively respond to oil-supply interruptions. In 2015, according to the IEA, France drew 78 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants."

The evidence from Politico's article states that Clinton led a task force created by her husband, President Bill Clinton, to reform the health industry and provide care for most of the population. On September 22, 1993, President Clinton gave a speech where he laid out his proposal based off the task force's findings, which included requiring all employers to provide insurance to workers. First Lady Clinton testified on the Hill for several days to explain and defend the plan before a handful of congressional committees. During her testimony, she expressed concerns about the individual mandate, stating that it would be an opportunity for employers to forgo providing insurance and push employees instead to the new individual market. She also expressed concerns about the administrative structure to track the individual contribution, collect it, and connect it with health insurance, which she believed would be extremely complicated and bureaucratic. However, she was not all that down on the individual mandate and considered it to be in the same ballpark as her plan, which was a means to universal coverage.\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, the label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim that Hillary Clinton opposed an individual mandate and favored an employer mandate in 1993.",
    "doc": "Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal still thinks the Affordable Care Act is unworkable and he found an unlikely ally to help him criticize the law: Hillary Clinton. Before you stop the presses or get Wolf Blitzer ready in the Situation Room, there\u2019s an important twist: Jindal was quoting Clinton from 1993. In an op-ed for Politico, Jindal rehashed his opposition to the individual mandate that requires most Americans to purchase health insurance, a key tenant of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. And he noted that Clinton was once against it, too. \"It is a well-known fact that Clinton came to strenuously support an individual health insurance mandate in her 2008 primary campaign against Barack Obama,\" Jindal wrote. \"Less well-remembered, however, is that Clinton considered an employer mandate \u2014 not an individual mandate \u2014 the best way to achieve \u2018universal coverage\u2019 in her health care task force\u2019s ill-fated 1993 proposal, put forth while she was first lady.\" Twenty years have passed since the Clintons\u2019 unsuccessful attempt at health care reform, but hey, we live in the days when hologram Michael Jackson performs on stage. So maybe what\u2019s old is new again, and a trip to the \u201990s is just what we need. The Clintons go to Washington In 1993, Hillary Clinton led a task force created by her husband, President Bill Clinton, with the goal of reforming the health industry and providing care for most of the population. On Sept. 22, 1993, President Clinton gave a speech where he laid out his proposal based off the task force\u2019s findings. Universal coverage, he said, could be achieved by requiring all employers to provide insurance to workers. First Lady Clinton then testified on the Hill for several days to explain and defend the plan before a handful of congressional committees. Clinton said that the administration settled on an employer mandate, rather than instituting a broad-based tax similar to Medicare, or an individual mandate, which a handful of Republicans had offered as a means of achieving universal coverage. We listened to several hours of Clinton\u2019s testimony and read many news accounts from 1993. We can say with confidence that Jindal is right: Clinton opposed delivering universal coverage entirely through an individual mandate and supported an employer mandate instead. But Jindal also picks out a couple of Clinton\u2019s concerns and tries to tie them to current events, as though her comments in 1993 foreshadowed Obamacare\u2019s impact on the health care industry. Perhaps Clinton\u2019s misgivings are relevant to today\u2019s debate, but not how Jindal portrayed them. For example, as Jindal notes, Clinton testified she thought employers may see the individual mandate as an opportunity to forgo providing their employees insurance and push them instead to the new individual market. Jindal tries to link this comment to the millions of individuals who had their policies canceled last year due to minimum requirements in Obamacare (which, he notes, contributed to PolitiFact\u2019s Lie of the Year). Clinton\u2019s concerns, though, have nothing to do with what happened to those people. The millions who had their policies canceled or changed last year bought plans from an independent provider, not through their employer. Clinton also thought employers might feel pressure under an individual mandate to keep wages low so employees would qualify for government-paid subsidies to purchase insurance on the private market. Jindal wrote, \"That sounds a lot like what the Congressional Budget Office concluded in February: that Obamacare will reduce the labor force by the equivalent of 2.3 million workers, because employers will not raise wages and individuals will choose not to work in order to retain access to government insurance subsidies.\" That\u2019s not what exactly what the CBO said, as we\u2019ve noted on multiple occasions. People aren\u2019t leaving jobs as part of a ploy to make themselves eligible for subsidies. Rather, the CBO said that the availability of affordable insurance would make it possible for individuals to voluntarily cut back hours or quit jobs they stayed in only for the health insurance (like someone with a pre-existing condition who previously could not get coverage on the private market and was working just for the insurance). It\u2019s worth noting, too, those weren\u2019t Clinton\u2019s only concerns. She also said that the existing private insurance system was heavily reliant on employer-provided coverage and an employer mandate would be the \"least disruptive\" and most familiar to people. Over the last two decades, though, fewer individuals are receiving health care benefits from their employer. It\u2019s still a plurality of Americans, but it has dropped steadily. In 1997, nearly 65 percent of individuals bought their insurance through their employer; in 2010 it was 56.5 percent, the U.S. Census said, and continues to decline. Kaiser Family Foundation, the non-partisan health experts, estimates it\u2019s down to 48 percent of the population. Clinton also worried that government couldn\u2019t create a system to pull off the individual mandate. She had \"great concerns about how the administrative structure to track the individual contribution, to collect it and to then connect it with health insurance would be set up.\" Such a system, she said, would be \"extremely complicated and bureaucratic.\" The technology the Obama administration utilized (eventually) to create a new market for buying and selling private health insurance is inconceivable to anything Clinton could have imagined back when the World Wide Web was an infant. That may have assuaged some of her concerns about the bureaucratic and logistical hurdles. Though, as Obama can attest, even with the technology, it hasn\u2019t been easy. Finally, we noticed Clinton wasn\u2019t all that down on the individual mandate, an idea promoted by moderate Republicans like Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. She said it was \"in the same ballpark\" as her plan because it was a means to universal coverage. It just wasn\u2019t her prefered pathway. She was more critical of alternatives offered by conservative Democrats that did not include any mandates at all."

    "doc": "Perhaps you have seen in your social media feeds an article headlined, \"Christian Pastor in Vermont Sentenced to One Year in Prison After Refusing to Marry Gay Couple.\" It received about 5,000 Facebook shares as well as interactions on other social media platforms. Is it real? We decided to take a closer look. The article was published at a site called NewsExaminer on July 10. It says that a pastor from Proctor, Vt., was sentenced to a year in federal prison after refusing to marry gay couples. It came just days after the Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, that same-sex marriage would be allowed in all 50 states. (The ruling didn\u2019t legalize same-sex marriage in Vermont, which approved it on its own in 2009.) But the bottom line is that the NewsExaminer is a fake-news site, and has been classified as such by Snopes, the urban legends site. Through a posting to an NBC copycat website with the url www.nbc.com.co, the article gained traction through mistaken association with the genuine NBC News site. The article cites several individuals involved in the case, but none seem to exist. The Christian pastor who was sentenced, Paul Horner, is actually a recurring name used in stories published by the National Report and other fake news sites. According to Snopes.com, the character Paul Horner has been used in past articles about everything from the British street artist Banksy to a Dolphin mascot for a Christian organization. (We\u2019ve previously run into the Zelig-like Horner in such articles as this one and this one.) The Hon. Myron Danus, the judge who supposedly made the ruling, is also fictitious. We checked the Vermont Court Administration Office in Montpelier, the U.S. District Court in Rutland County, and the Rutland County District Court to check if there is any judge by that name in the state, and there isn\u2019t. Though the LGBT Pride Center referenced in the article is real -- or at least there is an organization with a similar name -- Gwen Hawkins, the supposed president of the organization, does not exist. Instead, the Pride Center of Vermont lists Kim Fountain as its executive director. We also couldn\u2019t find a record for the Vermont Family Research Committee or its purported president, Steve Shand. There is one element of the article that is accurate: The town of Proctor exists. It is a small town in Rutland County, Vt.,with a population of just under 2,000. It is, as the article accurately says, \"home to the Vermont Marble Museum, and the only marble bridge in America.\" However, the Christian Proctor Church is as fake as its pastor. According to the Proctor Town Offices, the town has only three churches: St. Dominic\u2019s, Union, and St. Paul\u2019s."

While it is true that the number of employed blacks dropped by 540,000 people from January 2009 through August 2011, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, this decrease cannot be attributed solely to President Obama's policies.\n\nThe evidence provided by PolitiFact New Jersey suggests that there are several factors at play here, including the overall economic conditions during the Great Recession, which disproportionately affected black Americans.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) acknowledges the high rate of unemployment for blacks but does not blame Obama.\n\nMoreover, Mychal Massie, chairman of the National Leadership Network of Black Conservatives, argues that blaming President Obama for the employment decline is misguided and ignores the broader structural issues that contribute to unemployment in the black community. He suggests that blaming Obama for not addressing these issues is unfair and disingenuous.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be some correlation between President Obama's policies and the employment rates among black Americans, it is not accurate to say that he is solely responsible for the decline in employment.

    "doc": "Black and recently unemployed? Blame President Barack Obama, says the New Jersey Tea Party.\"Since Obama took office, a net of 540,000 additional black Americans \u2013 Obama\u2019s strongest supporters \u2013 have lost their jobs,\" the Tea Party retweeted to its followers on Sept. 2. The original tweet came from Ken Gardner, a junior fellow for The Right Sphere, a conservative website, and was retweeted by JeffM.Weingarten, president of Morristown Tea Party Organization.Pinning a race\u2019s employment status solely on the president of the United States seemed rather strong so PolitiFact New Jersey checked the statement. Turns out the unemployment statistic in the tweet is accurate, but blaming the president is less clear.First, let\u2019s break down the different elements of the statement.The number of employed blacks dropped by 540,000 people from January 2009 through August 2011, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington, DC. The number of employed whites for the same time frame dropped by 2.15 million.But that doesn\u2019t matter, Weingarten said in a phone interview, because the percentage of unemployed blacks is disproportionately higher than that of whites, which has a larger population.The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People acknowledges the high rate of unemployment for blacks, but doesn\u2019t blame Obama, said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP\u2019s Washington bureau and senior vice president for advocacy and policy.Both Shelton and the U.S. Department of Labor noted that initiatives such as education andmore training and employment services could help blacks get more jobs.But Weingarten said other issues need to be addressed. He said Obama \"is squarely to blame\" for the employment decrease among blacks because of programs such as \"Obamacare\" and unwillingness by corporations to spend money in a still-shaky economy.\"When you are the commander in chief and leader of the country, you are the one that promulgates and sees to it that policies are enacted or not,\" Weingarten said.Issues critical to the black community, including jobs, has always been on Obama\u2019s radar, according to a recent Associated Press article.Appearing at a daylong White House summit of black business, community and political leaders on Nov. 9, Obama said the current 15.1 percent unemployment rate among blacks is \"way too high,\" and that other problems that plagued black communities before he took office, such as housing and education, have worsened.The White House also disputed arguments that Obama has not targeted problems faced by blacks, according to the article.\"Since day one, the president has fought for the policies that matter to the African-American community,\" White House adviser Valerie Jarrett said.Shelton said Obama has attempted to address unemployment for all races but a number of bills have stalled or failed in Congress, or couldn\u2019t get committee hearings.Given that, blaming the president seems disingenuous, Shelton said.\"It\u2019s almost like someone deciding to knock you down and then blame you for falling,\" he said.But blame can be placed on Obama, said Mychal Massie, chairman of the National Leadership Network of Black Conservatives.\"Does Obama represent the government of the United States? If he represents the government of the United States then the answer is yes, unequivocally so, disgracefully and shamefully so, but not because he\u2019s black,\" Massie said. \"He is a poor example of leadership, and his profound ignorance of what it takes to rally an economy and his even more vacuous understanding of free-market enterprise and how it contributes to the creation of jobs.\""

Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate.\n\nThe article provides several examples of lawsuits filed by Abbott against the federal government, including 24 lawsuits filed since President Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009. The lawsuits cover a range of issues, including challenges to the Affordable Care Act, environmental regulations, and voting rights.\n\nThe article also provides context for why Abbott has filed so many lawsuits against the federal government. He told a tea party group that he sues the federal government \"every day,\" and his spokesperson confirmed that Texas files lawsuits on behalf of state agencies. The article notes that states' attorneys general often join forces to challenge laws, which could explain why Texas is listed as a plaintiff in some cases.\n\nWhile some of the lawsuits may have been filed defensively, rather than offensively, as Democratic activist Matt Angle suggests, the majority of the lawsuits appear to be an attempt by Abbott to challenge federal policies and laws that he disagrees with. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate based on the evidence provided.",
    "doc": "Here\u2019s a typical workday for Texas\u2019 attorney general: \"I go into the office, I sue the federal government and I go home,\" Greg Abbott was quoted as saying to a tea party group in an April 30, 2013, Associated Press news story. Speaking to FreedomWorks Texas in Austin on April 27, Abbott said, \"I\u2019ve sued the Obama administration now 25 times, over the last four years.\" Last fall, the Associated Press tallied two dozen: Abbott \"has filed 24 lawsuits against the federal government since Obama took office \u2014 litigation that has cost the state $2.58 million and more than 14,113 hours spent by staff and state lawyers working those cases,\" said a Sept. 9, 2012, news story. Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean emailed us an updated list of Texas\u2019 lawsuits against the federal government: three during President George W. Bush\u2019s tenure and 27 since President Barack Obama\u2019s Jan. 20, 2009, inauguration. (Abbott himself was sworn in Dec. 2, 2002.) Outcomes of the 27 Obama-era lawsuits, by our count: five clear-cut \"wins,\" eight \"losses,\" four cases in which Texas agreed to dismiss its case when circumstances changed, nine cases in progress -- and one that could be called a partial win, perhaps: 2010\u2019s 26-state challenge to Obamacare that ended with the Supreme Court declaring it was legal to tax individuals without health care, but states could not be required to expand Medicaid. Abbott\u2019s staff, Bean said, would count eight \"wins\" during the Obama administration, including the Medicaid decision and two dismissals in which \"the state got what it wanted.\" Bean noted all but one \"win\" are final (can no longer be appealed) and of the eight \"losses,\" she said, six are being appealed and one could be appealed. In our count of five \"wins,\" four lawsuits were against the Environmental Protection Agency and one against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The EPA has appealed one ruling to the Supreme Court, and FERC filed for a clarification of the judgment in its case. In most of the 27 cases, Texas was the lead plaintiff or only plaintiff. These included lawsuits in which Abbott was acting at the request of a department or branch of Texas state government. Bean said, \"We file them on behalf of state agencies. We\u2019re the lawyer, they\u2019re the client.\" Twice, Texas was originally listed among other states but not as the lead plaintiff, and in 11 cases Texas and other states or parties filed similar lawsuits that were bundled together by the courts sometimes resulting in Texas not being listed as the lead, or original, plaintiff. Both cases in which Texas was an original plaintiff but not the lead plaintiff involved challenges to Obamacare: the 2010 lawsuit by 26 states that ended with the Supreme Court declaring it was legal to tax individuals without health care and the 2012 case in which seven states sued over a requirement that religious employers offer insurance covering certain birth control methods. For perspective, we reached Stefanie Lindquist, associate dean for external affairs at the University of Texas Law School with a specialty in empirical legal studies. Lindquist told us by phone that she would not attach much significance to those circumstances when trying to determine whether Texas was itself suing the federal government agency. \"This is situations where they\u2019re actually named parties in the suit,\" she said, rather than, for example, filing a brief lending support to one side. States\u2019 attorneys general often join forces to challenge laws, she said, as in the Obamacare lawsuit that eventually included 26 states. (Texas was among 14 states listed as plaintiffs in the original suit, filed by Florida.) \"They\u2019re lending resources, so it\u2019s not that Texas is not a real litigant,\" Lindquist said. Even when later joining other plaintiffs, she said, \"I don\u2019t think that means they\u2019re not a plaintiff, I just think it means they\u2019re one of many.\" Democratic activist Matt Angle, whom we asked to weigh in, did object to Abbott\u2019s inclusion of the two multi-state Obamacare lawsuits. But he raised a larger objection: the inclusion of two cases in which Texas sought preclearance under the federal Voting Rights Act for changes to its voting process. Angle, founder of the Washington, D.C.-based Lone Star Project, told us by email that in filing these suits, Abbott \"took action as a defensive and not offensive tactic. ... No way he should get credit in these two instances.\" Under the Voting Rights Act, governments in certain jurisdictions (notably, several Southern states) where minority voter turnout was previously low must get federal clearance before changes in voting laws can take effect. To get that clearance, Lindquist said, \"you have a choice of two different avenues. One is you can request the preclearance of the election law change with the Department of Justice via letter. \u2026 Or, you can go to court to seek the preclearance\" by the action of filing a lawsuit. During the Obama administration, Texas has sought preclearance twice in high-profile cases -- in 2011, for redrawn legislative voting districts, and in 2012, for a measure requiring voters to show photo identification at the polls. In those cases, Lindquist said, \"to say yes, that the State of Texas sued the government, yes that\u2019s true.\" But looking at the main purpose of such suits, she said, \"it\u2019s not quite the same as suing the government to force the government to change its behavior. They\u2019re suing the federal government to seek preclearance under a federal law, and they\u2019re just going to a different forum to do it.\""

    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for John Kasich's statement that \"When I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus\" because the evidence provided in the article contradicts his claim. While there was a $236 billion surplus in 2000, which is the largest one-year surplus in American history, the government never actually had a $5 trillion surplus in hand. The projection of a cumulative $5 trillion surplus over 10 years, 2001 through 2010, was made by the Clinton administration in 2000, but this projection was subject to numerous assumptions about future growth in spending and revenues that didn't hold. Therefore, Kasich's claim of having left Washington with a $5 trillion surplus is misleading and inaccurate.",
    "doc": "Against the backdrop of acrimony in the House Republican Caucus -- leading to the resignation of Speaker John Boehner last week -- Republican presidential candidate John Kasich is harking back to his own tenure in the House, when, in his view, things moved more smoothly. \"Look, I was there in the '90s when we actually got things done,\" Kasich said in an interview on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation. \"Think about it. We changed the welfare system, which had been in place for about 40 years. We balanced the budget, of which I was chief architect. And we cut taxes. The economy was growing and we were doing great. And when I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus.\" A reader asked us about the $5 trillion number, and we didn\u2019t recall the surplus ever having been that high. So we looked back at the data. Kasich, now the second-term governor of Ohio, last served in the House in 2000, a year when Bill Clinton was ending his tenure in the White House and the Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress. That year, the federal government registered a $236 billion surplus. In raw dollars, that\u2019s the biggest one-year surplus in American history, but it\u2019s not anywhere near the $5-trillion number that Kasich mentioned. So what\u2019s going on? The Kasich campaign said it came from a 10-year figure for the size of the future surplus as determined by the Clinton administration in 2000. The administration projected a cumulative $5 trillion surplus over 10 years, 2001 through 2010. (We should note the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, projected a lower surplus over the same time period of $4.6 trillion.) Of course, this never actually panned out, for a variety of reasons, including the technology bust, the post-9/11 attack recession and the Bush tax cuts, which decreased tax revenues collected. The bigger problem with Kasich\u2019s claim is the shorthand terminology used to describe that number. Even though Kasich said, \"When I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus,\" the government never actually had a $5 trillion surplus in hand -- it had a projected $5 trillion surplus (and it was over 10 years, not one). That projection was also subject to numerous assumptions about future growth in spending and revenues -- assumptions that, as it turned out, didn\u2019t hold. Kasich\u2019s campaign acknowledged that his phrasing was somewhat elliptical. \"It\u2019s a bit of budget jargon to shorthand it to a \u2018$5 trillion surplus\u2019 and leave off the \u2018projected,\u2019 but it reflects the way these types of projections are used in policy and budget planning,\" said Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Kasich. Kasich \"typically notes that the $5 trillion was a projected surplus, but failed to do so in this instance,\" added Rob Nichols, another Kasich spokesman."

    "doc": "Republican gubernatorial candidate Eric Greitens claims Democrats spent $1 million against him just before the August primary election. On an Aug. 11 Fox & Friends appearance, Greitens said, \"We had the Democratic Governors Association and the Obama political machine come into a Republican primary to try and rig the election by spending $1 million against me in the last couple of days.\" That number stood out, so we decided to investigate the claim. We reached out to Greitens' campaign staff for more information. Parker Briden, a campaign spokesman, said Greitens was referring to television attack ads aired against Greitens right before the primary. Campaign finance records Briden referred us to Missouri campaign finance reports filed by the Chris Koster campaign detailing contributions from Jobs and Opportunity, a political action committee. Koster won the Democratic primary for governor and will square off against Greitens in the general election in November. Beginning two weeks before the Aug. 8 primary, the PAC made four \"in-kind\" contributions \u2014 contributions of goods and services and not cash \u2014 to Koster for Missouri, Koster's campaign. The in-kind contributions carried a total valuation of over $1 million, according to the reports filed by the Koster with the Missouri Ethics Commission. The largest contribution was reported as $713,082, made on July 29. The same week, two other contributions were made \u2014 one valued at $112,560, and another for $150,080. On Aug. 5, three days before the election, the committee made a final contribution valued at $25,710.82. After the donations were made, the Greitens campaign issued a press release titled \"Koster Caught in Conspiracy to Hijack Republican Primary.\" \"This is an attempt by national Democrats to steal an election in Missouri through meddling in the Republican primary,\" the release read. Attack ad The reported contributions coincided with a series of television ads attacking Greitens that aired in the five days before the primary. A group called Jobs and Opportunity is credited for paying for the ad. A YouTube video of the ad was posted on July 29, about a week before the primary. According to Koster's campaign finance expenditures, his campaign normally pays between $500,000 and $700,000 for media advertising. No other single campaign expenditure comes close to that amount. That puts the PAC's contribution in perspective \u2014 it's unlikely a $1 million in-kind contribution would buy anything else. The ad lambastes Greitens for accepting a separate $1 million contribution from Michael Goguen, a California-based tech financier. Goguen is the subject of a pending civil lawsuit with a woman who has accused him of sexual abuse. \"While others returned his money, Greitens says he's honored to take it,\" the ad's narrator says. Greitens is right: the Democratic Governors Association is behind money given to his Democratic opponent. The Washington, D.C. address for Jobs and Opportunity that the Koster campaign reported to the Missouri Ethics Commission is also the address for the Democratic Governors Association. A week before the election, Jobs and Opportunity made a $1 million in-kind contribution to Koster, which coincided with a TV ad attacking Greitens. Although the political action committee is unaffiliated with Koster\u2019s campaign, Koster's campaign had some knowledge of the ad before it aired, since the in-kind contribution was listed on Koster's campaign finance report. PACs that act independently from a candidate do not have to report contributions to that candidate's campaign, said James Thomas, the campaign treasurer for Catherine Hanaway, who was a Republican gubernatorial candidate in the primary. But when the PAC is in contact with the candidate, related contributions need to be reported. For example, the PAC could have discussed when the ad's content or when it would be aired with Koster's campaign, Thomas said. Since Missouri has no limits on campaign contributions, it's okay that the PAC talked to Koster's campaign. It would be a different story if this were a federal election, though, Thomas said. Federal PACs can only contribute $5,000 to a candidate, so Jobs and Opportunity\u2019s $1 million in-kind contribution would be illegal. On July 31, Greitens released an ad in response to the PAC's ad. In the ad, which has since drawn national attention, Greitens fires rounds of a machine gun into an open field. \"Eric Greitens is under attack from Obama's Democrat machine,\" the narrator of the ad says. \"When he fights back, he brings out the big guns.\" After the primary, Greitens said no other Democratic groups launched attack ads against any other Republican gubernatorial candidate, according to the Associated Press. We also asked Austin Chambers, Greitens' campaign manager, why Greitens repeatedly cited President Barack Obama's involvement in the ad buy. And though Koster's donations were big, they were legal, despite Greitens' press release connoting Koster's involvement in illegal activity. Koster's campaign directed all questions to the spokesman for the PAC. Marvin Overby, an MU political science professor, said large donations like the PAC's are common before an election. \"This happens a lot. It's just part of the rough and tumble of politics,\" he said. \"I'm not sure the Greitens' campaign wouldn't have done the same thing.\""

These actions suggest that Cohen has taken steps to improve the economic situation in Memphis and Shelby County, which contradicts Flinn's claim that he has not delivered.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that Flinn's claim that the unemployment rate in Shelby County has reached 9.7% under Cohen's tenure is False.",
    "doc": "With what sometimes appears to be an unlimited supply of money to spend on campaign commercials, Dr. George Flinn is flooding the airwaves trying to make voters in the 9th Congressional District reconsider returning the incumbent, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, to Washington, D.C.In a campaign mailershowing the crumbling edifice of a large brick building, Flinn, the state\u2019s biggest campaign self-funder, provides voters with numbers that indicate the unemployment rate in Shelby County is more than twice as bad now as it was when Cohen began in Congress. The 9th is comprised mostly of Memphis, with some parts of northern Shelby County, and recent national media reports have pointed out that Cohen is one of the few southern white Democrats remaining in Congress.\"When Congressman Cohen took office in 2007, the unemployment rate was at 4.8 percent,\" reads one bullet point. And then the very next one says, \"The unemployment rate in Shelby County has reached 9.7 percent.\"The Cohen campaign has challenged the veracity of many claims by Flinn, a radiologist who has built his wealth by owning radio stations and spent millions on various campaigns since 2002. Cohen\u2019s campaign says the mailer contains numbers that are both out of context and inaccurate. So we asked the Flinn campaign for evidence.On statements like this, where statistics are used in an attempt to assign someone credit or blame, it is PolitiFact policy to a) determine the accuracy of the numbers and b) the extent to which the designation of credit or blame is accurate.Flinn spokeswoman Kristi Stanley defended the mailer and said the numbers came straight from federal statistics as reported by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics.But when we double-checked, we found that the Cohen campaign was closer to the truth -- Flinn\u2019s campaign either misread the statistics or cherry-picked other numbers from the years 2007 (when Cohen took office) and 2012 (the current election year).Cohen officially took office as the 9th Congressional District representative in January of 2007, following his election in November of 2006 to succeed five-term Congressman Harold Ford Jr. The originally reported unemployment rate for Shelby County for January of 2007 was 5.5 percent. When it was later revised, the new numberwas 5.7 percent. Either way, a significant distance from the 4.8 percent listed on the mailer.What about the unemployment rate now? The 9.7 percent figure used by the Flinn campaign appears to be pegged to reports for July, but the unemployment rate by August dropped to 9.0 percent in Shelby County.Those numbers for August did not become available until Sept. 27, so it\u2019s possible the mailer was prepared with only the July numbers available. In any case, the most recent figures reported on Oct. 25 show the unemployment rate for Shelby County had dropped to 8.4 percent, following national trends.As to whether Cohen deserves blame for the unemployment rate\u2019s worsening in Shelby County since arriving in D.C. in January of 2007, we reached out to some economists and consulted similar PolitiFact rulings involving other elected officials.Malcolm Getz, an associate professor of economics at Vanderbilt University, put it this way in an email: \"One member of Congress has 1/435 of the vote in the House of Representatives. Whatever passes the House must also pass the Senate. The system is designed to allow many voices to be heard and counted with no single voice having determinative effect.\"And: \"Macroeconomic phenomena like the unemployment rate is strongly influenced by events outside of government control.\"Economics professor John Gnuschke, head of the University of Memphis\u2019s Sparks Bureau of Business and Economic Research, had a similar reaction: \"A single Congressman doesn't have the ability to change the direction of the economy or the recovery.\"Gnuschke wrote further that \"economic conditions in Memphis mirrored those in the rest of the nation and were in no way unique. . . . Improvements locally have been slow because the nation's recovery from the Great Recession has been slow. Congressman Cohen was not the cause of the decline and is not the problem with the slow recovery. Look to a weak private sector and their unwillingness to hire and invest as the issue of the day.\" Google makes it possible to create charts that show the unemployment rate over time, and you can compare different geographies. When you match up the unemployment rates for the United States, Tennessee, Shelby County and Memphis, you get four lines that rise and fall consistently at about the same rate.The Cohen campaign strongly believes Cohen does not deserve blame for the numbers, and points to examples that it says represent actions that improved the economic situation in Memphis and Shelby County.Cohen campaign manager John Marek wrote in an email: \"Congressman Cohen brought us Tennessee\u2019s first Minority Business Center, which will give racial minorities and women more access to business loans, which means jobs. Congressman Cohen also saved 500 jobs when he ensured that the American Steamship Company came to Memphis, and he created many jobs in Memphis when he brought us the $15 million Tiger grant, which will be a big development project downtown. He supported President Obama's jobs bill, which was blocked by Republicans in Congress.\"Marek also made this point -- Flinn was a Shelby County Commissioner from 2004 to 2010: \"Arguably a County Mayor and County legislature would have more to do with the unemployment numbers than a Federal Congressman.\"Flinn\u2019s campaign stands by the mailer and says Cohen has not delivered."

    "justification": "The label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim \"\"We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.\"\" because the evidence provided in the article supports this statement. The article explains that the civilian labor force participation rate, which measures the number of Americans in the labor force as a percentage of the total civilian population, is at its lowest level since the 1970s. This suggests that fewer Americans are working compared to previous years. Additionally, while the employment-population ratio, which measures the number of people employed relative to the total population age 16 and above, has improved in recent years, it is still below its pre-recession highs. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the claim is true.",
    "doc": "During the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took aim at the nation\u2019s economic record under President Barack Obama. \"The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama,\" Cruz said. \"But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.\" We decided to fact-check Cruz\u2019s statement that we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today since 1977. Cruz is on to something. One key employment statistic known as the civilian labor force participation rate is at its lowest level since the 1970s. This statistic takes the number of Americans in the labor force -- basically, those who are either employed or who are seeking employment and divides it by the total civilian population. Here\u2019s a chart going back to the mid 1970s. When the civilian labor force participation rate is low, it\u2019s a concern, because it means there are fewer working Americans to support non-working Americans. But we\u2019ll offer two asterisks for Cruz\u2019s statement. First, as we\u2019ve noted before, a notable factor in the decline of the labor-force participation rate is the aging of the Baby Boom generation. As more adults begin moving into retirement age, the percentage of Americans who work is bound to decline. When we last looked at this question in 2013, Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, told us he had estimated that the labor-force participation rate would have fallen in recent years on the basis of aging alone. That said, Cruz has a point that the recession exacerbated that decline. In a weak job market, some people who might otherwise want a job may return to school, become full-time parents or retire early. Second, there\u2019s another way to read Cruz\u2019s words. He said \"the lowest percentage of Americans working\" since 1977, which could also refer to a different statistic, the employment-population ratio. This statistic takes the number of people who are employed and divides it by the civilian population age 16 and above. The difference in this case is that using the employment-population ratio, Cruz\u2019s statement is incorrect. Unlike the labor-force participation rate, the employment-population ratio has actually been improving in recent years, although it\u2019s below its pre-recession highs. Here\u2019s a chart showing this statistic over the same time frame: If you exclude the Great Recession, the employment-population ratio was last at its current rate in 1984, not 1977. So by that measurement, he\u2019s close."

According to the chart from a 2007 Congressional Budget Office report, federal expenditures for R&D peaked in 1964 at 1.92 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), but by 2008, the percentage had dropped to .73 percent, representing a decrease of 62 percent or nearly two-thirds. This evidence supports the label \"True\".\n\nThe article explains that the loss of federal support has been cushioned by industry funding, but it also highlights the limitations of industry investment in late-stage research and development. The article quotes Patrick Clemins, director of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's R&D Budget and Policy Program, who notes that while industry invests in projects with a high potential for profit, they are less likely to fund big ideas or take risks. Debbie Hart, president of BioNJ, also raises concerns about the impact of declining federal support on the economy and society as a whole.\n\nThe justification for the label \"True\" is based solely on the evidence provided in the article, which shows a significant decrease in the government's support for R&D since the 1960s. While industry funding may be providing some support for R&D, the evidence suggests that the overall level of investment in this area has decreased significantly over time.",
    "doc": "Two paths that could affect the future of science are diverging on Capitol Hill, according to U.S. Rep. Rush Holt.One -- the idea \"that the federal government can play no substantive role in advancing science or technology\" -- the Democratic congressman calls \"grim and pessimistic.\" The other -- the idea that recognizes federally funded scientific endeavors can help the economy flourish -- Holt calls \"far more hopeful.\"But, he said, it\u2019s the former that\u2019s taking root in Washington.\"The argument is that the government has been ineffective, that \"investment\" is a codeword for wasteful spending, and that the only way forward is for the government to lower its sights, stop making new investments, and scale back spending,\" Holt, a physicist, wrote in an opinion article posted on NewJerseyNewsroom.com on Sept. 16. \"This view is encapsulated in the recently enacted Budget Control Act of 2011, which demands $2.4 trillion in federal spending cuts. Considering that, as a share of the US economy, the government\u2019s support for research and development (R&D) has fallen by nearly two-thirds since the 1960s, I have little doubt that R&D will bear more than its share of these latest cuts.\"Lawmakers are now wrangling over what funding to slash from the federal budget. As they do, PolitiFact New Jersey checked Holt\u2019s statistic on federal support for research and development.The rocket scientist is right.Holt\u2019s staff sent us a chart from a 2007 Congressional Budget Office report that illustrated spending on research and development in the United States as a percentage of gross domestic product, or GDP.GDP is the value of all goods and services produced within the country; basically, it\u2019s a measure of the nation\u2019s economy.As a percentage of GDP, federal expenditures for research and development peaked in 1964 at 1.92 percent, according to data from the National Science Foundation. In 2008, the most recent data available on expenditures, the percentage stood at .73 percent. That\u2019s a decrease of 62 percent, or nearly two-thirds.So, Holt is correct.But it\u2019s worth noting that overall spending -- including funding from government, industry, universities and nonprofit entities -- on research and development during that time frame did not see such a significant drop. In 1964, overall funding, as a percent of GDP, was at 2.88 percent. In 2008, it was 2.79 percent, a decrease of 3 percent.Statistics from the National Science Foundation show the federal government funds 57 percent of basic research. Business, however, foots the bill for the majority of applied research, at nearly 61 percent, and development, at 84 percent, according to 2008 data. What do those statistics mean? We reached out to several experts to find out.The loss of federal support has been cushioned by industry funding, according to Patrick Clemins, director of the American Association for the Advancement of Science\u2019s R&D Budget and Policy Program.But, he said, \"industry invests in late stage research, things that they can turn a profit on in a relatively short time frame,\" which results in \"less big ideas, but less risk as well.\"Debbie Hart, president of BioNJ, said while industry is looking for both innovation and profit, they are \"furthering their best shots on goal.\"With industry looking to fund projects near the finish line and government support as a percent of the economy dwindling, Hart poses two questions: \"What are we missing? What are the missed opportunities?\"If the decline in federal support for research and development continues, Michael J. Pazzani, vice president for research and economic development at Rutgers University, said we\u2019ll see, \"fewer people pursuing careers in academic research, fewer discoveries.\""

The White House fact sheet and the Nation's Report Card both provide data indicating that there is a significant disparity between white and minority students in math and reading scores at the fourth-grade level. According to the report, 14 percent of black boys and 18 percent of Hispanic boys are considered proficient in reading, while 58 percent of white boys meet this benchmark. This evidence supports the claim that a large portion of African-American and Hispanic boys are struggling with reading at an early age. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "President Barack Obama recently announced a new initiative that was close to his heart: a national effort to close achievement gaps and create opportunities for minority boys. \"My Brothers Keeper,\" unveiled at the White House on Feb. 27, 2014, combines philanthropy and research to help move young men of color from the streets into schools and the workforce. \"I'm going to pen this presidential memorandum directing the federal government not to spend more money, but to do things smarter, to determine what we can do right now to improve the odds for boys and young men of color, and make sure our agencies are working more effectively with each other, with those businesses, with those philanthropies and with local communities to implement proven solutions,\" Obama saidat the White House launch event. Many Democrats in Congress voiced their support for Obama\u2019s push to help young minorities. Among them was Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., who joined the cause on Twitter. \"By 4th grade, 86 percent of African-American boys and 82 percent (of) Hispanic boys are reading below proficiency levels,\" shetweeted. It\u2019s an eye-opening statistic, and one that spoke to Obama\u2019s new effort. But is it accurate? The Nation\u2019s Report Card When we contacted Slaughter\u2019s office, a spokesman pointed us toa White House fact sheetwith an almost identical claim: \"Large disparities remain in reading proficiency, with 86 percent of black boys and 82 percent of Hispanic boys reading below proficiency levels by the fourth grade \u2013 compared to 58 percent of white boys reading below proficiency levels.\" In turn, the White House said the numbers came fromThe Nation\u2019s Report Card, a federal assessment conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Since 1969, the National Assessment of Educational Progress has tracked student achievement in such subjects as reading, mathematics, science, writing, U.S. history, and by a variety of demographics, including race. Broadly,proficiency is definedby the government as students being \"able to integrate and interpret texts and apply their understanding of the text to draw conclusions and make evaluations.\" According to the 2013 report card, there is a significant disparity between white and minority students in math and reading scores at the fourth-grade level. While 46 percent of white students were proficient in reading, just 18 percent of black students and 20 percent of Hispanics meet the same benchmark. For each group, those numbers have risen quite a bit since 1990, when 16 percent of white fourth-graders were reading at a proficient level, compared to just 1 percent of blacks and 5 percent of Hispanics. Gaps in mathematic scores have been similar. Meanwhile, Asian/Pacific Islanders outpace all races and ethnicities in both reading and math in the fourth grade. It\u2019s also worth noting that there\u2019s no improvement in proficiency levels by the time students finish the eighth grade. Similar numbers of students start behind and stay behind. But Slaughter\u2019s tweet specified black boys in particular. To get those statistics,we had to dive deeper into the report. Usingthe government\u2019s data, we found that 14 percent of black boys and 18 percent of Hispanic boys read at a proficient level in the fourth grade. This means that 86 percent of black boys and 82 percent of Hispanic boys were not proficient. So Slaughter\u2019s numbers are right on. By contrast, about 58 percent of white boys are considered proficient. And what about girls? They perform slightly better across all races than boys."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, it can be justified that the claim that Stephen Webber \"voted to allow sex offenders to be within 500 feet of childcare centers and playgrounds, and even voted to allow sex offenders to be coaches\" is Conflicting. The article provides a detailed explanation of how the bill changed between its original version and the final version that was passed by the Senate, and how Webber's vote differed based on these changes.\n\nFirstly, the article clarifies that Webber voted in favor of the original version of the bill that aimed to prevent sex offenders from being near childcare centers and playgrounds, as well as from serving as coaches for children under 17 years of age. This suggests that Webber initially supported stricter regulations against sex offenders.\n\nHowever, when the bill returned from the Senate with an exemption clause allowing certain offenders to petition to have their names removed from the sexual offender registry, Webber voted against the final version of the bill. According to the campaign manager for Webber, Emily Waggoner, this was due to the new exemption language in the final bill, which Webber believed weakened the original version of the bill.\n\nThe article then goes on to provide a detailed analysis of the changes made between the original and final versions of the bill, confirming that the specific language cited by Webber's campaign as the reason for his change in vote existed in the final bill. This suggests that Webber's opposition to the final version of the bill was not due to a lack of support for stricter regulations against sex offenders, but rather due to his belief that the exemption clause weakened the original bill.\n\nBased on this evidence, it can be concluded that Webber's vote against the final version of the bill was not a blanket approval of sex offenders being near childcare centers and playgrounds or serving as coaches for children under 17 years of age. Rather, his vote was based on his belief that the exemption clause undermined the original stricter regulations against sex offenders. Therefore, the label Conflicting is appropriate.",
    "doc": "In October, Republican Caleb Rowden\u2019s campaign uploaded a video to its YouTube channel attacking Democrat Stephen Webber for voting against a bill that would ban sex offenders from playgrounds and child care centers and from coaching children under the age of 17. The Missouri Republican Party also sent out mailers advertising the same claim. Webber \"voted to allow sex offenders to be within 500 feet of childcare centers and playgrounds, and even voted to allow sex offenders to be coaches,\" the video said. Rowden and Webber, both former state representatives, face each other in a battle to fill the 19th Senate District seat vacated by Kurt Schaefer, who couldn\u2019t seek re-election because of term limits. The bill in question, Missouri House Bill 62 from 2009, was a lengthy crime bill that changed a number of laws. Among these were the introduction of laws banning child sex offenders from knowingly being within 500 feet of a public park with a playground or swimming pool, or from a child care facility when those under the age of 18 are present, and from serving as a coach, manager or athletic trainer for a sports team with children under 17 years of age. History of the bill Rowden is correct that Webber voted against the final version of this bill when it came back from the state Senate. But Webber voted in favor of the bill before the House sent it to the Senate. So what made him change his vote between April 16 and May 15, 2009? Webber\u2019s campaign manager, Emily Waggoner, explained the reasoning in a phone interview. \"Stephen voted for the original version of the bill that they\u2019re talking about that prevents all those things from happening, and then it came back from the Senate with this weird exemption language allowing people to exempt themselves from sex offender registries. So he voted for the strongest version of that bill; it came back and it was a bill that had a new exemption in it and he refused to support a weaker version of that bill.\" So we took a look into the actual legislation to confirm these changes between the version of the bill that was sent to the Senate and final bill, and found that those changes did exist. The specific part the Webber campaign cites as the reason for voting against the final version of the bill is explained in the bill summary this way: \"Allows an offender of certain misdemeanor sexual offenses to petition to exempt his or her name from the sexual offender registry if he or she meets current qualifications for the removal or exemption and was younger than 19 years of age at the time of the offense.\" This text did not exist in the summary of the bill prior to it going to the Senate. Webber wasn\u2019t the only member of the House to change his vote after the bill came back from the Senate. The bill that was sent to the Senate was agreed to in the House by a margin of 141 to 9. The final version of the bill was passed in the House by a slightly tighter margin of 124 to 34."

    "doc": "In New Hampshire\u2019s highly competitive 1st Congressional District race, a Republican group is using a new ad to draw a stark contrast between Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter and her GOP challenger, former Rep. Frank Guinta. Here\u2019s the narration of the ad, which was paid for by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House Republicans\u2019 election arm: \"Carol Shea-Porter votes with Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Democrats 95 percent of the time. More spending, higher taxes. We need a change. As mayor, Frank Guinta brought a tax cap to Manchester and balanced four straight budgets. Frank will take on both parties. Cut spending, fight for a balanced budget, and restore Medicare to protect our seniors. Independent New Hampshire values, that\u2019s Frank Guinta.\" But is the comparison in partisan voting patterns really that stark? The answer is no. Their records are easy to compare, because Shea-Porter and Guinta have traded off ownership of the seat over the past several election cycles. Shea-Porter was elected to the House in 2006 and 2008, lost to Guinta in 2010, then beat him in a rematch in 2012. The ad footnotes Shea-Porter\u2019s 95 percent partisan voting record to a Washington Post vote study. That shows that Shea-Porter did indeed vote with her party 95 percent of the time in the current Congress. A similar study by Congressional Quarterly shows Shea-Porter\u2019s partisan unity score ranging between 95 percent and 98 percent each year during her congressional career. So the ad has a point that Shea-Porter has loyally voted the party line in the House. The problem with the ad is in suggesting that Guinta has done the opposite. He hasn\u2019t. The same Post tally shows that in Guinta\u2019s term in Congress -- covering 2011 and 2012 -- he voted with his party 96 percent of the time. That\u2019s barely distinguishable from how Shea Porter voted with her party. The CQ tally shows much the same: Guinta had a 97 percent partisan unity score in 2011 and 95 percent in 2012. NRCC spokesman Ian Prior countered with two arguments. First, he said that if Guinta had served as Manchester mayor with a \"my-party-is-100-percent-right attitude, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to implement a tax cap (or) balance four straight city budgets.\" Second, he said that Shea-Porter\u2019s votes that make up that 95 percent \"are out of touch with her district and show that she puts her own liberal agenda ahead of her district.\" Both points have merit but are far from bulletproof. On Prior\u2019s first point, city-level policymaking tends to be more technocratic and shaped less by the national political partisanship that drives Congress. In the exact comparison between the two candidates -- how they have voted in Congress -- they have both voted in virtual partisan lockstep. On his second point, that Shea-Porter\u2019s votes are out of step with the district, we\u2019ll just note that the district voted for Obama for president not once but twice. It\u2019s possible that voters have grown disgusted with his agenda since his 2012 reelection. We\u2019ll soon find out: That\u2019s what elections are for."

The evidence provided shows that the United States has experienced net job growth of about 8.4 million people from 2010 to 2015, which is higher than the growth experienced by other advanced economies outside of the United States. While the President's wording of \"putting more people back to work\" may be open to interpretation, the evidence does support the claim that the United States has seen a greater increase in employment compared to other advanced economies.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the President's claim could be interpreted as implying that the United States has put all of those people \"back to work,\" which may not accurately reflect the reality of the situation. The evidence provided does show that the number of people who have returned to work in the United States exceeds the net total for all other advanced economies combined, but it does not necessarily mean that all of those people were previously unemployed and have now found work again. It is possible that some of those people may be entering the workforce for the first time, or that others may be changing jobs or industries.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence provided also shows that while the number of long-term unemployed Americans has fallen consistently from its recession peak, the labor force participation rate has fallen consistently since President Obama took office, which suggests that some people may have given up on finding work. This could potentially mitigate the President's claim that \"we\u2019ve put more people back to work\" in recent years.\n\nIn conclusion, while the evidence provided does support the President's claim that the United States has experienced net job growth and put more people back to work than other advanced economies, it is important to interpret the claim with caution and recognize that it may not accurately reflect the full complexity of the situation.",
    "doc": "Positive economic indicators were a major piece of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2015 State of the Union address, including a claim he repeated throughout 2014: that the American economy has outperformed the economies of other advanced countries. In talking about his goals for the upcoming year, Obama said, \"As we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan and all advanced economies combined.\" We previously rated a similar statement by Obama, giving him a Half True for the claim that \"we've created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office.\" His numbers at the time were off, and it seemed like the other economies were ever so slightly edging out the United States for total jobs created. A few months later, we\u2019re able to update this fact-check with more recent data. The new information actually lines up better with Obama\u2019s claim. But there are still problems with the idea that people are being put back to work. How does the U.S. compare to the other advanced economies? For this fact-check, we\u2019ll use International Monetary Fund data. The IMF classifies 36 countries as \"advanced economies\" and seven of those as \"major advanced economies.\" We looked at total average annual employment from 2010 through 2015. (This counts the number of payroll positions, meaning one person who works two jobs would be counted twice.) Country or Group 2010 employment 2015 employment, estimated Absolute growth Percent growth United States 139.1 million 147.5 million 8.4 million 6.1 percent IMF: 36 advanced economies (except U.S.) 326.8 million 334.7 million 7.9 million 2.4 percent IMF: G7 major advanced economies (except U.S.) 196.4 million 201.4 million 4.9 million 2.5 percent According to the IMF, then, the net number of people employed in the United States has grown by about 8.4 million people. As Obama said, this is higher than all other advanced economies combined -- the 35 advanced economies outside of the United States expanded by 7.9 million in the same time frame. And it\u2019s clearly more than what happened in the smaller group of other G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom). Still, the United States is the most populous of the advanced economies by far -- it has more than twice the population of Japan, which is the next most populous advanced economy. (China, Russia and India are not considered advanced economies.) So it\u2019s logical that there will, in general, be more employment growth in absolute numbers compared to smaller nations. Looking at the percentage growth rate instead of the absolute number of jobs helps to account for the population differences among these advanced nations. And by this measurement, the United States is not on top. The United States\u2019 percentage growth rate is lower than quite a few nations on the IMF\u2019s list of advanced economies, including: Australia, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Iceland, Israel, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland. The country on this list with the highest job growth rate was Singapore, with a rate of nearly 15 percent. Is the U.S. putting 'more people back to work'? So if you look at net job creation, the White House claim is on target. What about the wording of putting \"more people back to work,\" as Obama said? To support its claim when we fact-checked this a few months ago, the White House cited an internal analysis -- one we weren\u2019t able to access for independent verification. The White House press office said the analysis used IMF data for the 36 advanced economies. They told PolitiFact that the analysis \"finds that 14.9 million people have returned to work in advanced economies since the beginning of 2010. Just over half\u2014or 7.5 million\u2014are in the United States. In other words, the number of people put back to work in the United States exceeds the net total for all other advanced economies combined (7.4 million).\" The White House said it\u2019s notable that the United States accounts for the majority of these jobs since the U.S. population only accounts for about 31 percent of the population in advanced economies. The White House added that within the narrower group of G7 nations the U.S. share \"vastly exceeds the rest of the G7 (7.5 million vs. 4.6 million).\" However, the White House is using net employment gain, which doesn\u2019t necessarily refer to people who became unemployed and went back to work -- the clearest definition of putting people \"back to work,\" as Obama said. It\u2019s possible that it could include people entering the workforce for the first time. We were unable to find other research to corroborate Obama\u2019s claim. On the question of putting people back to work in the United States alone, we found that the Obama administration does have some data on its side. Statistics for the long-term unemployed have fallen consistently from their recession peak, both measured by the number of long-term unemployed Americans and the median duration of unemployment. The following Bureau of Labor Statistics chart shows the median duration of unemployment, in weeks, since January 2009, the start of Obama\u2019s presidency. Still, the median length of unemployment is 13.7 weeks now, which is higher than it was in January 2009 (10.7 weeks). More importantly, the labor force participation rate -- that is, the percentage of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population that is either working or looking actively for work -- has fallen consistently since Obama took office, from 65.7 percent to 62.8 percent. This graph from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the falling rate of labor participation since January 2009, when Obama took office. If these two data points sound paradoxical, they\u2019re not. On the one hand, among the pool of people still looking for work, fewer have been looking for more than 27 weeks. On the other hand, that pool of people looking for work has shrunk, because many workers have simply dropped out of the labor market, rather than finding a job. The idea that long-term unemployed Americans are increasingly leaving the labor force is supported by an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by FiveThirtyEight.com\u2019s Ben Casselman. The data led him to conclude that \"the share of the long-term jobless who are giving up their job searches has been rising steadily, even as the job-finding rate has remained largely flat.\" This puts a damper on the notion, stated by Obama, that \"we\u2019ve put more people back to work\" in recent years. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, added a word of caution. She noted that presidents are far from the only factor in economic growth, so it would be unrealistic for Obama to claim too much credit for these numbers. Indeed, the United States hemorrhaged jobs in the last months of 2008 and the first few months of 2009 -- meaning there was a lot of room to grow. \"Is it a good thing to just put people back to work?\" Sinclair said. \"This mostly means we had a terribly bad recession and have finally recovered from it. That's not necessarily something to consider a policy triumph.\""

The data shows that the rate of admissions for substance abuse treatment in Rhode Island has been declining since 2009, rather than reaching a 20-year high. In 1993, the rate of admissions was 96 per 100,000 Rhode Islanders age 12 and older, but by 2011, it had decreased to 166 admissions. While there is a slight increase in the trend line since 1999, it is not statistically significant. Therefore, Sullivan's statement cannot be supported by the evidence provided.\n\nSecondly, the U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) officials confirmed that there are limitations to the data, which make Sullivan's position problematic. The TEDS (Treatment Episode Data Set) data does not support the assertion that the number of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment has reached its highest point in 20 years. According to Smith, a statistician with the administration's Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, the percentages have remained relatively stable.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the claim \"The proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment primarily due to marijuana use has reached its highest point in 20 years\" is False.",
    "doc": "When the House Judiciary Committee was considering legislation to tax and regulate marijuana, Kathleen Sullivan, Warren\u2019s substance abuse coordinator, stepped forward to warn the committee about the dangers of marijuana use. \"We do know that the proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment primarily due to marijuana use has reached its highest point in 20 years,\" she told the committee during the April 29 hearing. When we contacted her for details, she emailed statistics collected from the states by the U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. Her data on admissions for substance abuse treatment, primarily for marijuana, ranged from 1993 through 2011, a year shy of the 20 years she spoke of. According to those statistics, the rate of admissions in 1993 was 96 per 100,000 Rhode Islanders age 12 and older. In 2011, the rate was 166 admissions. But this wasn\u2019t the highest that the rate has ever been over the past two decades. It peaked at 218 in 2009 and then declined in the next two years. The number of admissions, unadjusted for population, peaked that year as well, and then dropped. When we looked at the number of admissions that the federal agency reported online for 2012 and 2013, we found that the decline has continued, showing a drop each year since 2009. In her email, Sullivan qualified her statement saying: \"I was referring to the overall trend in marijuana admissions.\" So we took another look at the data and examined the trend in admission rates, even though she didn\u2019t make this distinction in her testimony. The trend from beginning to end for admissions per 100,000 teens and adults has been up over the past two decades. But if you look at the trend line since 1999, there has been no statistically significant increase. We also contacted the U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration directly and officials there told us there are limitations to the data that make Sullivan's position problematic. One major problem is that an individual can be counted more than once each year depending on how many times he or she has been admitted for treatment, explained Kelley Smith, a statistician with the administration's Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. Smith said the data, known as the Treatment Episode Data Set or TEDS, do not support the assertion that the number of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment has reached its highest point in 20 years. \"Not according to TEDS,\" Smith said in an email. \"According to TEDS, the percentages have remained relatively stable.\""

The label Conflicting accurately captures the nuances of this statement and the evidence supporting it.",
    "doc": "Almost two years before the Sept. 11 terror attacks, Donald Trump says he urged the United States to eliminate Osama bin Laden. \"Remember that in \u2018The America We Deserve,\u2019 I wrote that book in 2000, I wrote about Osama bin Laden: \u2018We\u2019ve got to take him out,\u2019\" Trump said during a Dec. 2 rally for his presidential campaign in Manassas. Trump rarely leaves a rally without saying that well before the Sept. 11 attacks, he was among the first to recognize bin Laden\u2019s danger. We wondered whether his claim about the warning in his book is accurate. \"The America We Deserve\" was published in January 2000. Trump was considering a presidential bid that year, and the book laid out his views on an array of issues, including terrorism. Bin Laden is mentioned once in the 304-page book, in a passage criticizing then-President Bill Clinton for having an unfocused national security policy during an era when the U.S. no longer faced one central threat, such as the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Here\u2019s what Trump wrote: \"Instead of one looming crisis hanging over us, we face a bewildering series of smaller crises, flash points, stand offs, and hot spots. We\u2019re not playing the chess game to end all chess games anymore. We\u2019re playing tournament chess - one master against many rivals. One day we\u2019re assured that Iraq is under control, the UN inspectors have done their work, everything\u2019s fine, not to worry. The next day the bombing begins. One day we\u2019re told that a shadowy figure named Osama bin Laden is public enemy number one, and U.S. jet fighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later, it\u2019s on to a new enemy and a new crisis.\" The reference to bin Laden relates to the Aug. 20, 1998, U.S. bombing of his camps in Afghanistan and Sudan. Clinton said they were in retaliation for terrorist bombings earlier that month on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Clinton said the goal of the U.S. strikes was to \"disrupt bin Laden\u2019s terror network.\" In the next paragraph of his book, Trump wrote that the U.S. also was \"haphazard\" in early 1999 when it intervened with NATO in the Kosovo War. Again, Trump mentioned bin Laden only once in his book. He did not call on the U.S. to target the terrorist leader individually, or to wage a unilateral war against his al-Qaida terror network. In many of his speeches this year, Trump has gone a step further and said that he \"predicted\" bin Laden in his 2000 book. Trump didn\u2019t make that claim in Manassas, where he was diverted by demonstrators in the midst of his comments about bin Laden and did not return to the subject after the protesters had been removed. Trump, in his book, described China\u2019s emergence as an economic power as \"the greatest long-term challenge\" facing the U.S. and North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions as biggest short-term \"menace.\" He devoted a chapter to terrorism. Trump wrote that the U.S. \"must prepare for the real possibility that somewhere, sometime, a weapon of mass destruction will be carried into a major American city and detonated.\"He acknowledged that this was not an original thought, noting that ABC-TV\u2019s \"Nightline\" had aired a series of shows about the threat. Trump wrote that such an attack likely would be carried out through germ warfare. We tried to contact Trump\u2019s campaign for this fact-check, but did not get a response."

    "doc": "Lenny Curry, head of the Republican Party of Florida, said President Barack Obama is going to have a hard time winning Florida, citing gas prices and federal spending as just two reasons.\"Obama\u2019s going to come here and spend a lot of money, but President Obama's going to have to run on his record. He's going to have to run on what he promised,\" Curry said in an interview on Bay News 9\u2019s \"Political Connections\" on March 4, 2012.\"He promised gasoline I believe at $2.50. When he took office it was about $1.68. We know it's well above $2.50 now. He promised he would cut the deficit in half. We know what's happened there,\" Curry said.Curry went on to praise Florida Gov. Rick Scott for job creation, saying that showed a clear contrast with the Obama administration.Curry, a businessman from Jacksonville, became head of the state party in September 2011. He was the hand-picked successor of party chairman Dave Bitner, who died after a fight with Lou Gehrig's disease.We wondered if Curry was accurate in describing Obama\u2019s promises to voters, so we decided to check it out. Here at PolitiFact, we take a special interest in the campaign promises of elected officials. We collected Obama\u2019s promises for our Obameterand Scott\u2019s promises for the Scott-O-Meter.We asked the Republican Party of Florida for evidence to back up Curry\u2019s claims about Obama\u2019s promises on gas prices, but we didn\u2019t hear back.Curry said that gas prices were at $1.68 when Obama took office, and on that point, he\u2019s largely correct. The national city average for regular unleaded at the beginning of 2009 was $1.79, so that\u2019s in the ballpark, considering flexibility for regional variations.But what did Obama promise on gas prices? Here, we\u2019ll look at whether Obama promised gasoline prices at $2.50 a gallon. (In a separate report, we\u2019ll look at whether he promised to cut the deficit in half.)Back in the summer of 2008, Obama said the federal government should immediately consider energy rebates and releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. For the long term, though, he had other ideas for energy policy, such as investing in renewable fuels and making cars more fuel efficient. (See all of Obama\u2019s energy promises here.)Obama has broken one significant gas-related promise: to enact a \"windfall profits\" tax on oil companies. In 2008, he said the new tax could pay for energy rebates to American families. We gave that a Promise Broken on our Obameter back in March 2011. Aides said the tax was not necessary after gas prices fell from their 2008 highs. We have yet to hear of any moves to revive the plan.The closest we could find to a promise on gas prices were comments Obama made in Winston-Salem, N.C. in April 2008: \"I want to invest that money in clean, affordable, renewable energy sources like wind power, and solar power, and biofuels, so that we're not talking about high fuel prices next summer or the next summer after that or the summer after that.\"But that\u2019s a far cry from pledging a particular price.We did find one current candidate making such a pledge: Republican Newt Gingrich said he would keep gas prices at $2.50 or less if elected president.\"I've developed a program for American energy so no future president will ever bow to a Saudi king again and so every American can look forward to $2.50 a gallon gasoline,\" he said at a CNN debate.Analysts, though, are dubious of the power of any president to affect short-term gas prices.\"What can you do to change the market in the short term? The answer is not much,\" said James Bartis of the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research group that provides independent policy analysis. \"It takes many years to open up a new oil field, to prepare and get production from a new oilfield. Generally, I would say a decade is the minimum.\"Obama recently mocked Republicans for promising lower gas prices in a speech in Miami. \"It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to make phony election-year promises about lower gas prices. What\u2019s harder is to make a serious, sustained commitment to tackle a problem,\" he said."

The evidence provided in the article suggests that the number of small businesses who will be affected by the employer mandate is much lower, with only 5-9% of small businesses saying they will cut back hours or replace full-time workers in response to the health care law. Additionally, the article notes that many small businesses already offer health benefits and are not subject to penalties in 2015. The article also highlights the limitations of the survey conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, including the fact that only a small percentage of respondents said they were prepared to understand what's required to participate in health care insurance exchanges. Based on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim of 75% of small businesses being forced to fire workers or cut hours is greatly exaggerated and not supported by the data.",
    "doc": "Sen. Marco Rubio says it\u2019s not too late to stop Obamacare. In fact, he says, Congress should refuse to pass a spending bill that funds it, even at the risk of shutting down government. That\u2019s because he sees \"mounting evidence of how Obamacare creates more problems than it solves, particularly for small business owners and the people who work for them.\" One of those pieces of evidence: the number of small business who \"say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours.\" According to his FoxNews.com op-ed on July 25, 2013, that number is a jaw-dropping 75 percent. (He repeated the claim in a July 29 piece for RedState.com, \"Shut Down Obamacare, Not Government.\") Rubio blames the health care law\u2019s now-delayed employer mandate, which requires businesses with the equivalent of 50 or more full-time employees to offer affordable, comprehensive health coverage or potentially face penalties of $2,000 or more per full-time worker after the first 30. That creates a disastrous disincentive, he argues: \"If you are a small business with about 47, 48 or 49 employees and you want to hire more people, Obamacare encourages you to hold back on hiring new workers or cut the hours of existing ones so that you don\u2019t reach 50 employees. That is why 75 percent of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours.\" Do three in four American small businesses say the health care law will drive them to fire workers or cut their hours? Survey says Rubio\u2019s not alone in his distaste for the employer mandate, which has detractors on the right and left. Even some supporters of the health care law don\u2019t like the way the mandate\u2019s structured, noting that it may discourage hiring and create an incentive to keep workers under 30 hours. But do 75 percent of small businesses say they face that pressure? Rubio\u2019s office provided us with a July 16, 2013, Washington Examiner article headlined \"74% of small businesses will fire workers, cut hours under Obamacare,\" which begins: \"Despite the administration's controversial decision to delay forcing companies to join Obamacare for a year, three-quarters of small businesses are still making plans to duck the costly law by firing workers, reducing hours of full-time staff, or shift many to part-time, according to a sobering survey released by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\" It goes on to summarize results from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s quarterly Small Business Outlook Study. We read the the study and reached out to the chamber. And there\u2019s a problem with that \"three-quarters of small businesses\" claim. Well, a series of problems, actually. Categories don\u2019t add up The study was conducted among a national sample of 1,300 executives for small businesses, defined as fewer than 500 employees and with annual revenue less than $25 million. It included chamber members and non-members \"weighted to be representative of the small business population.\" But it turns out the question the Washington Examiner and Rubio cited wasn\u2019t asked of the entire group \u2014 something not clear in the published results. The chamber told us executives were first asked whether the employer mandate would affect them: As a result of the health care law, the employer mandate will require employers with more than 50 full-time workers to offer health coverage to all full-time employees and their dependents or face a penalty. The law defines a full-time employee as someone who works 30 hours per week and the penalty is based on the number of full-time employees. Will you be impacted by the employer mandate? Just 17 percent of the small business executives said yes. So less than one in five businesses that participated in the survey said that the employer mandate would even affect them. Those 17 percent were then asked how they planned to respond. They could select as many answers as they felt applied to them: Please indicate how your business will react to this new mandate. Please select all that apply. a. Reduce hiring to avoid surpassing the 50 full-time equivalent employees (24 percent) b. Cut back hours to reduce the number of full-time employees (27 percent) c. Stop providing employee health insurance d. Replace full-time employees with part-time workers (23 percent) e. None of the above The chamber published responses for answers A, B and D \u2014 the responses cited by the Washington Examiner and Rubio. It has not provided responses for answers C and E. So, the only way to reach 75 percent is to not only ignore the majority of executives who didn\u2019t answer the question, but also to fold those who said they would \"reduce hiring\" with those who planned to cut hours or replace workers. And we just don\u2019t know how many employers said, \"None of the above.\" It\u2019s also not clear from published results exactly what percentage of affected businesses said they would cut hours or replace workers. It could be as high as 50 percent, assuming there was no overlap between the executives who said they planned to replace full-timers with part-timers and those who said they would cut back hours. It could be as low as 27 percent, assuming total overlap \u2014 that the same people who said they would replace full-timers with part-timers also said they intended to cut back hours. So, of all small businesses in the study, how many said they would cut back hours or replace full-time workers in response to the health care law? Just 5 percent to 9 percent. And that\u2019s in line with other evidence. Most companies have 10 employees or less \u2014 far from the 50-employee threshold. Meanwhile, of firms with 25 to 49 people \u2014 a group Rubio said he was concerned about \u2014 87 percent already offer health benefits, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s annual employer survey. Of those with 50 to 199 employees \u2014 the smallest businesses actually subject to penalties in 2015 for not offering insurance \u2014 94 percent already offer benefits. Meanwhile, under the law, businesses with fewer than 25 employees may already qualify for tax credits for offering coverage \u2014 an extra boost they didn\u2019t get before. Still, surveys show small businesses are worried. A May Gallup poll commissioned by an employment law firm showed that 41 percent have held off on plans to hire new employees, 19 percent have reduced workers, and 18 percent have reduced employees\u2019 hours to part time. Part of the problem, said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, is that small employers don\u2019t actually know yet how the law will affect them. Only 30 percent of respondents in the U.S. Chamber\u2019s small business survey said they were prepared \u2014 including understanding what\u2019s required to participate in health care insurance exchanges. \"There's a lot of misinformation and a lot of ideology out there,\" Blumberg said."

    "doc": "Back in the spring, jobs and jobs alone seemed the core issue in the presidential race. Since then, the menu of issues has become longer, but a recent flyer from Americans for Tax Reform, a leading anti-tax group, seeks to put jobs front and center once again.The flyer appeared in mailboxes in New Hampshire and asks, where did the stimulus money go? A photo of President Barack Obama superimposed above a sprawling map of China in fire engine red provides an answer. Below the fold, an iconic photo of Mao Zedong is set against a newspaper headline \"NH has lost more jobs to China than any other state.\"Inside, the text reads \"The stimulus was intended to create \u2018green\u2019 American jobs. But the Obama administration funneled close to $2 billion to overseas firms. A DemocraticSenator said this would create thousands of jobs in China.\"There is a lot to unpack here but the gist of it comes down to the assertion that about $2 billion in \"green\" stimulus money went to foreign companies, with particular benefits for China at the expense of American workers. That\u2019s a claim that we can check.Foreign wind and solar suppliersAmericans for Tax Reform cites the work of the Investigative Reporting Workshop, a project of American University headed by investigative journalists. In February, 2010, the workshop wrote that it had found that the largest stimulus program to develop alternative energy had handed out $2.1 billion for wind, solar and geothermal power and of that, 79 percent went to companies based overseas.We dug further and found some reports that Americans for Tax Reform missed but that bolster its claim. A later study from the workshop estimated the amount that had gone to overseas firms had reached nearly $2.4 billion. Later still, about a year after the first report, the lead author again updated his findings. The journalist, Russ Choma, noted that \"most of the jobs that were created, in the United States at least, were short-term construction jobs.\"\"Since the bulk of the companies that received the money were foreign,\" Choma continued, \"and the bulk of the equipment (like wind turbines) were purchased from foreign companies, who mostly do their production overseas, very few of the high-skill, high-pay manufacturing jobs that green energy development can bring ended up in the United States.\"A study by the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the domestic portion on wind projects ranges from 48 percent to 66 percent of the total investment. For large solar projects, the domestic portion falls in the 42 percent to 71 percent range. A complicated jobs pictureThose wide ranges tell us that connecting taxpayer dollars to American jobs is not simple. Some foreign companies have American subsidiaries. Some American firms import large components.The people who have tried get a handle on this have looked at the two main programs the government used to build the renewable energy sector. The biggest program, called Section 1603, subsidized energy producers. It paid the project developers 30 percent of the total project cost after an installation was complete. So far, Section 1603 has cost about $14 billion.The smaller program, Section 48C, also provided a 30 percent subsidy but was focused on manufacturing. It helped companies that built or expanded manufacturing capacity in the U.S.. The final cost for 48C was $2.3 billion.Teasing out the ways that Section 1603 money worked its way through the economy is tricky. The reporter cited by Americans for Tax Reform spoke about his own uncertainty after months of research into wind power.\"I can't say how many of the turbines built by American manufacturers were overseas,\" Choma said, \"and how many of the turbines built by foreign manufacturers were built here.\"The case of the Danish firm Vestas shows the challenge when dealing with foreign-based firms. Vestas supplied over 1,800 turbines in the U.S. between 2009 and 2011, or about 15 percent of the total added in those years. On the power production side, the Section 1603 subsidies for the turbines alone would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But Vestas also received nearly $52 million through the government\u2019s program to boost manufacturing.Those dollars ended up in Colorado for the construction of American subsidiary plants, Vestas Nacelles, Vestas Blades, and Vestas Towers. A declining wind industry has led to layoffs but at last count, the Danish firm employed about 1,700 workers in those plants, with about 5,000 workers statewide tied to the wind industry.\"This is insourcing,\" said Peter Kelley, spokesman for the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group. \"It\u2019s important to draw foreign investment that creates jobs here in the U.S.\"Tracking the jobs for a domestic company is no easier. GE is the nation\u2019s largest supplier of wind turbines. The Connecticut-based firm is providing the turbines for a wind farm in Alaska. GE might be an American company but the project includes blades made in Brazil and towers from China. On paper, it might look like stimulus money would stay in the country but in fact, not all of it would.The most detailed estimate of the total number of American jobs created through the 1603 program comes from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. In a 2012 report, it found that from 2009 to 2011, spending on wind and solar produced some 57,000 to 80,000 jobs each year in construction, manufacturing and ongoing operations. These are the jobs that remain after you subtract the dollars that went overseas.Importantly, the total earnings of American workers tied to these projects fell in the range of $9.5 billion to $14.3 billion. If these numbers are right, they tell us the low end of that estimate is more than the cost of the 1603 program, about $8.7 billion, during those years. This might be expected since 70 percent of the project costs were covered by private money. The China factorThe flyer from Americans for Tax Reform casts China as a major beneficiary of stimulus spending. While Chinese firms have certainly received some contracts, they do not seem to have played a major role. Their biggest place in the American renewable energy marketplace is in solar.China has about half of the American photovoltaic market, according to Recharge News, an online industry magazine. In 2011, that was worth about $2.8 billion to Chinese manufacturers.Subsidies for the solar industry through the 1603 program amount to about 20 percent of all spending. Wind accounts for about 70 percent of the dollars.In wind, China is a negligible player. Of over 12,000 turbines installed under the 1603 program by 2011, Chinese firms had a role in six -- five in Texas and one in Iowa. This according to the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group.For the curious, here is the national breakdown for the number of turbines installed in the U.S.from 2009 to 2011, according to the American Wind Energy Association and the Congressional Research Service:United States - GE, Clipper - 49 percentGermany - Siemens, RePower, Nordex -15 percentDenmark - Vestas - 15 percentSpain - Gamesa - 7 percentIndia - Suzlon - 6 percentJapan - Mitsubishi - 6 percentAll others - 2 percent"

    "doc": "Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Charlie Crist has started outlining what he wants to change about Florida, and he\u2019s starting with how much women earn. \"Women in Florida make 83 cents for every dollar a man makes,\" Crist said in a campaign email sent out July 29, 2014, the same day he announced his First Day of Fairness plan. The plan outlines a series of executive orders Crist promised to make on his first day in office if he is elected. The potential orders promote causes like government transparency, raising the minimum wage among businesses contracted with the state, and, in this case, ending gender wage discrimination for employees of those contractors. PolitiFact has checked many claims about women making less than men, especially the past few years. Is Crist right about them making only 83 cents on the dollar in Florida, or is he short-changing voters? Time to check the paychecks. Measuring the gap The Crist campaign told us they took the figure from an April 2013 release by the National Partnership for Women & Families, a Washington-based a think tank focusing on women\u2019s issues. The factsheet reads, \"In Florida, on average, a woman who holds a full-time job is paid $33,823 per year while a man who holds a full-time job is paid $40,951 per year. This means that women in Florida are paid 83 cents for every dollar paid to men, amounting to a yearly gap of $7,128 between men and women who work full time in the state.\" Those numbers are from a larger report by the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2011 American Community Survey, which estimated median annual earnings for men and women who worked full-time, year-round over the prior 12 months. It\u2019s worth noting right now that this data has already been revised. An April 2014 release from the same think tank updated the numbers from the 2012 Census survey estimates that Floridian women are making 84 cents on the dollar. That\u2019s not what we\u2019d consider a huge increase, but it still is a discrepancy compared to Crist\u2019s claim. (His campaign didn\u2019t tell us why they used the lower number.) But the Census Bureau isn\u2019t the only federal agency that tracks income data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics measures in terms of weekly wages, not yearly. Unlike the Census Bureau, this method does not account for people who are self-employed, but it does include some people not measured in the Census Bureau\u2019s annual figures, like some teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers. These BLS numbers show that Florida women who worked full time in wage and salary jobs had median usual weekly earnings of $668 in 2011, which was 84 percent of men\u2019s median weekly earnings. That edged up slightly to 85 percent in 2012. Nationally, the comparable figures from 2012 show a similar pattern: Census shows the gap at about 77 cents, while BLS says women make 82 percent of what men make. Both evaluations say Floridian men and women make less than the national median income, although the gender wage gap is marginally smaller. Why is that? There are several reasons, and none of them are flattering for Florida. Alayne Unterberger, associate research director at Florida International University\u2019s Research Institute on Social and Economic Policy, said there\u2019s a high level of working, single mothers in Florida, and they tend to have less education and fewer quality job opportunities. The National Women\u2019s Law Center says almost 66 percent of Florida women make $10.10 an hour or less, and that while men only need a high school degree to move out of low-wage earning status, women usually require at least a bachelor\u2019s degree. The slightly better wage gap is only because men in Florida are likelier to earn less than the national average at a greater rate than the state's women are, shrinking the difference. \"Historically in Florida both male and female wages have been depressed,\" Unterberger said. She pointed out that a study FIU published in 2014 found that the wage gap has only decreased about 1.8 percent since 1990. \"We haven\u2019t done a very good job of narrowing that gap over the years.\" Using 2013 mean wages (not median), the FIU study adjusted for age, education level and occupation. It found that overall, women in Florida make about 82 cents on the dollar compared to men. Caveats apply to what all these evaluations actually show. Gender wage gaps nationally are different from occupation to occupation, as the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research showed in its report on the top 20 occupations for women for 2011. While the gap was lesser in fields like nursing (96 cents to every dollar) and cashiering (90 cents), it was higher in accounting (77 cents) and financial advising (66 cents). While discrimination is partly to blame, another factor is that men and women historically enter different occupational fields at different rates, a trend known as \"occupational segregation.\" The Institute showed that women more often choose to be receptionists, nurses and teachers, for example, while men pursue paths as truck drivers, managers and software engineers. That means overall, women are more often employed in lower-paying fields than are men. Women also disproportionately earn college degrees that lead to lower-paying jobs than men, and take more time off work for pregnancy and child care, according to a 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh. That trend, though lessened by increased male involvement in child rearing, often restricts women\u2019s career options and hours worked."

    "doc": "The Rhode Island General Assembly is considering legislation that would prohibit employers from asking job applicants if they have a criminal history. They could ask finalists if they have ever been in trouble with the law, but they could not deny a job because of an applicant\u2019s criminal history, unless the crime was directly related to the type of job being sought.The measure is designed to prevent discrimination against people who have paid their debt to society. Supporters say ex-convicts who have a good job are less likely to break the law again.Carolyn Medeiros, executive director of the Alliance for Safe Communities, was on WHJJ's \"Helen Glover Show\" Feb. 18 to express opposition to the proposal, saying the offenders pose an extra risk to employers and the community and shouldn't get preference over job seekers who have kept out of trouble.\"We're bending over backwards here for a minority of people,\" she said. \"Think of the other things that are afforded to them, Helen. There's a tax credit of $2,400 to bond them that an employer would get for hiring a convicted felon. There's a federal bonding program -- you can get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon. And there's federal grants for felons to set up their own small businesses.\"I think we're doing plenty to help out this population,\" she said. \"I think we need to worry about the law-abiding citizen's fight to get a job now, and that should be at the top of our priority list.\"Do employers really get thousands of dollars in tax breaks and bond money for hiring convicted felons? And does the government offer special small business grants for ex-cons?We contacted Medeiros, who quickly referred us to various links on her website at ASC-RI.org. You can find them at the bottom of the \"Re-entry, 'Fast and Furious Nationwide'\" section of the site.We\u2019ll start with the third part of her statement -- \"there's federal grants for felons to set up their own small businesses\" -- because it\u2019s the simplest to judge.The \"Federal small business grants for convicted felons\" section of her page has links to two websites. The first explicitly says, \"there are no grants set up to help felons start their own business\" and \"Felons are at a disadvantage when they apply for grants, but that doesn't preclude them from applying.\" The second says exactly the same thing.So Medeiros' owns sources contradict that part of her statement.Second, let's look at her statement that \"There's a federal bonding program -- you can get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon.\"Her web page has a link to an unsourced document on the Alliance website, which, she says, came from another source.We tracked down what the document was talking about and found that employers do not, as Medeiros said, get $5,000 to $25,000 in federal money to hire a convicted felon. Instead, employers can get a free bond -- the equivalent of an insurance policy worth $5,000 to $25,000 -- to cover the expenses of an ex-convict going rogue. The Federal Bonding Program is financed by the U.S. Department of Labor and administered by individual states.Laura Hart, spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training, said $5,000 is the typical value of the seldom-used bonds given out in Rhode Island \"and it is only to insure the employer against theft, not against any other kind of behavior.\"The employer must contact DLT after the ex-felon has been offered a job to arrange for the bond, and the potential employee must meet with DLT.\"All the bonding does is provide a different level of assurance to an employer to try to reconnect this particular population to the work force. Is anybody making money off this bond? The employer isn't,\" Hart said.Finally, Medeiros\u2019 claim that \"there's a tax credit of $2,400 to bond [former inmates] that an employer would get for hiring a convicted felon\" is mostly correct.She erred in characterizing it as a bond. It's a tax credit. Called the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, it is designed to encourage employers to hire people in a variety of categories, including veterans, food stamp and welfare recipients, and, most importantly for our purposes, \"an individual who has been convicted of a felony and has a hiring date that is not more than 1 year after the conviction or release from prison.\"The credit can only be taken for the first year the ex-felon is on the job. The amount of the credit is capped at $2,400."

    "doc": "Former Gov. Jeb Bush is courting Hispanic voters to build momentum for his presidential run, pointing out that he relied upon the demographic during his gubernatorial campaign. \"In my re-election in 2002, I won the majority,\" he told Telemundo\u2019s Jose Diaz-Balart in Spanish during a July 27, 2015 interview. \"I won more Hispanic votes than Anglo votes, 60 percent in the state. It can be done.\" Bush has some advantages over most of his GOP rivals when it comes to Hispanic voters: He speaks Spanish fluently and his wife, Columba, is a native of Mexico. But did he really win re-election as governor with 60 percent of the Hispanic vote, higher than his percentage with white voters? We decided to revisit the polls and find out. Demographic shift The percentage of the vote is important, because the majority of registered voters in Florida are white. In 2002 there were 7 million white voters, with other ethnicities totaling 2.3 million. The Florida Department of State told PolitiFact Florida that it\u2019s tough to say exactly how many Hispanic voters were registered in 2002, because Division of Elections record-keeping has since changed. Registrations then were recorded as either \"white,\" \"black,\" \"other\" or \"unknown/not given.\" In 2013, the percentage of the electorate that is Hispanic was between 14 and 18 percent, a number that has probably grown since 2002. Bush cruised to re-election that year, winning 56 percent of the vote over Democrat Bill McBride. His campaign focused on Hispanic voters, with Bush giving interviews in Spanish and running Spanish-language campaign ads. Afterward, analysts and media coverage credited Bush with taking anywhere from 57 to 65 percent of the Hispanic vote. That would usually be an oddity for a non-Hispanic, Republican candidate, but not necessarily Bush. In 1998 he garnered 61 percent of Hispanic voters against Buddy McKay, versus 60 percent of white voters. But breaking down 2002\u2019s numbers isn\u2019t as clear cut as it would be for other years. Voter News Service, a joint poll by ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, CNN and the Associated Press, stopped providing numbers on Election Night 2002 after it decided its computer analysis was flawed and couldn\u2019t give reliable results. That meant a dearth of data for national and state races, and no exit polls that dissected the race, gender or economic status of Florida\u2019s voters. That left independent analyses to pick up the slack. But most of those generally accepted Bush had won the Hispanic vote handily. Fernand Amandi, managing partner of Miami-based polling firm Bendixen & Amandi, said a combination of low turnout and a strong, older Cuban electorate gave the Republican an advantage. Some estimates said 80 percent of Cuban voters rallied around Bush. \"The 2002 exit poll was flawed and not kept for reference, but targeted precinct analysis suggests he did clear the 60 percent threshold,\" Amandi said. \"Without the benefit of a definitive exit poll, I would speculate he did as well or better against Bill McBride.\" One widely cited study from the Center for Immigration Studies pegged Bush\u2019s support among Hispanics at 57 percent in 2002. University of Texas government professor Daron Shaw provided data from a Fox News poll for that analysis. Shaw also thought the Cuban population favored Bush, a factor that's especially in play in Florida. \"I do recall the number and wasn\u2019t particularly surprised,\" he said. \"The Cuban population in Florida makes it a unique Hispanic cross-section, one that is much more friendly to Republicans than the national cross section.\""

    "justification": "The claim made by David Dewhurst that he has cut taxes 63 times, including the largest property tax reduction in state history, is Conflicting. While Dewhurst provides evidence of 54 tax cuts and claims a total savings of $15 billion, the article presents conflicting information. The evidence suggests that many of the tax cuts were carefully targeted towards specific entities or transactions, rather than benefiting every Texan. Additionally, the article highlights that some of the tax cuts were funded by tax increases, contradicting Dewhurst's claim of a net tax decrease. Furthermore, the article notes that the 2006 property tax reduction was partly funded by tax increases and that the total taxable value of property in Texas rose each year from 2005 to 2007, which could have contributed to an increase in school property tax collections despite the rate reductions. The article concludes that while Dewhurst may have supported various tax-cut proposals passed into law during his tenure as lieutenant governor, he did not personally cut any taxes and his powers were limited to appointing committees and setting the Senate's floor agenda. Therefore, the claim of cutting taxes 63 times is overstated and Conflicting.",
    "doc": "David Dewhurst, seeking his fourth term as lieutenant governor of Texas, consistently talks up the state\u2019s economy while simultaneously noting tax cuts. The Houston Republican, who presides over the Texas Senate, touted 54 tax cuts in a recent video ad. A bit earlier, in an Oct. 1, 2013, post on his campaign website, he took credit for even more. \"Under my leadership, the Texas Senate has helped strengthen our state\u2019s foundation with essential conservative legislation,\" Dewhurst said. His post singled out actions to balance budgets, address border security and tort reform, stop Medicaid from expanding, restrict abortions--and to cut taxes. The Senate passed legislation to cut \"taxes for all Texans,\" Dewhurst\u2019s web post continued. \"I have cut taxes 63 times, including a 2006 property tax reduction that ranks as the largest in state history.\" Dozens of Dewhurst-provided cuts? We were curious. Big picture, Texans paid about the same level of taxes in 2010 (the latest year of available data) as they did when Dewhurst took over as lieutenant governor in 2003, according to calculations by the non-partisan Tax Foundation in Washington, D.C. Foundation figures indicate that on average, Texans ponied up 5.7 percent of their personal income for state and local taxes in Texas both of those years. Still, in between that percentage dropped to as little as 5.1 percent, in 2006 and 2008, the figures suggest. After we inquired into Dewhurst\u2019s reference to cutting taxes 63 times, Dewhurst\u2019s campaign blog post was amended to say 54 cuts. We stuck with checking what was posted for about two months. Earlier, to our request for backup information, Dewhurst campaign spokesman Travis Considine emailed a document headlined \"David Dewhurst Tax Cuts\" stating that since becoming lieutenant governor, Dewhurst \"has cut taxes by more than $15 billion through 63 pieces of legislation.\" Among the listed measures, a 2006 measure setting in motion one-third reductions in school district maintenance and operation property tax rates is credited with \"savings\" of more than $12.6 billion, accounting for 84 percent of Dewhurst\u2019s total declared savings. A convention of Texas state government is to estimate costs and savings in one- or two-year increments. That's probably because lawmakers almost always budget two years at a time. By email, Considine told us the campaign chose to list five-year savings figures when they were available from fiscal notes written by budget board staff at the time the cited measures passed into law. He didn\u2019t say why. Not noted on Dewhurst's backup: The 2006 reduction was partly funded by tax increases. According to a chart emailed to us Dec. 3, 2013, by John Barton, a staff spokesman for the Legislative Budget Board, the various increases were initially projected to raise nearly $4.7 billion in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. In that year, the chart indicates, the property-tax reductions were expected to cost the state about $7 billion--while in reality, the tax hikes generated about $2.5 billion less in 2011 than initially predicted. We took a long look at the campaign's list of tax-cut measures, finding the vast majority to be carefully targeted, that is, not necessarily benefiting every Texan. By our count, about 40 of the changes in law related to exempting particular entities or transactions from sales or property taxes, many of them not lacking a precise savings estimate. Dewhurst\u2019s document lists about 10 sales tax-cut measures. The largest, at a value of about $700 million through five years, is a 2013 law exempting from the sales tax through 2026 \"depreciable tangible personal property directly used in qualified research,\" the legislation\u2019s fiscal note states. Another 2013 law provided for sales tax refunds to providers of cable or Internet access was projected by the budget board at a value of $250 million over five years. Dewhurst\u2019s document also specifies a 2009 law placing backpacks among items subject to the state\u2019s annual three-day \"sales tax holiday,\" a change projected to save affected taxpayers more than $40 million over five years, according to the proposal\u2019s fiscal note. Also noted: A 2007 law exempting pay-phone calls from the sales tax at a projected five-year value of more than $6 million, per the relevant state fiscal note. Among about 30 listed measures touching on property taxes, a 2013 law exempted equipment in certain data centers from property taxes at a projected five-year value of $58 million. A 2007 law protecting elderly and disabled homeowners with homestead exemptions from being stuck with potentially higher school taxes was projected by the state to save beneficiaries (and cost the state) $745 million over five years, while a 2009 law giving full homestead exemptions to fully disabled veterans was predicted to be worth more than $50 million over five years. Dewhurst\u2019s document lists a half-dozen laws related to the business franchise tax, though there appears to be a little duplication in that an exemption of small businesses was simply extended. A 2013 law changing who pays the tax, extending a small business exemption and temporarily lowering the tax rate was projected to reduce such tax collections by $1.3 billion over five years. By far, though, the stand-out measure on Dewhurst\u2019s list is House Bill 1, signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry in May 2006 and described by Dewhurst as cutting school property taxes by more than $12.6 billion over five years. We couldn\u2019t confirm that figure, but the budget board chart shows more than $30 billion in state expenditures from 2007 through 2011 to cover the state costs of the tax cuts. Separately, it\u2019s been disputed whether the 2006 actions whittled taxes as much as some ballyhooed. In 2010, we rated as Mostly False a Perry claim that \"we cut property taxes by one third.\" The tax-rate mandate did reduce school property taxes at first. School tax collections declined 6.4 percent between 2005 and 2007, the year the cuts were fully implemented, according to the Texas Education Agency, which also offered us data showing that collections for school maintenance and operations taxes were 30.2 percent lower in 2007 than the state projected they would have been without the tax cut. A business group, the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, reached a similar conclusion by comparing 2007 school property taxes with what it calculated Texans would have paid without the mandated cut. The related savings were about $7 billion, it said. \"The average Texan's total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been had there been no tax relief initiative,\" the group concluded. Then again, school property tax collections ultimately increased partly because districts had leeway to inch up their rates over the years and benefited, in many cases, from increasing property values. In both 2006 and 2007, the total taxable value of property in Texas rose more than 10 percent each year. The taxpayer association identified other reasons that the overall reduction in property taxes did not meet expectations: increases in the portion of school taxes dedicated to bond debt, as well as increases in taxes paid to cities, counties and other taxing districts. As we noted above, Dewhurst\u2019s declared tax cuts were accompanied by some tax hikes intended to make up a portion of the school revenue lost due to the rate reductions. As described in a TTARA guide to Texas school funding, revised in January 2012, legislators created a tax-relief fund to reimburse districts by drawing on revenue gains from a revised and expanded business franchise tax and increases in state cigarette and tobacco taxes, plus a change in how the state calculates the taxable price of used cars and trucks. According to the guide, some $2.2 billion was to be pulled from the fund in the 2011-12 school year. A May 19, 2006, Austin American-Statesman news article called the expansion of the state\u2019s business tax the \"centerpiece\" of Perry\u2019s plan to cut school property taxes. As he signed the business-tax measure into law, Perry said: \"\"Today I am proud to sign into law landmark business tax reforms that will provide greater fairness for employers, reliable funding for our school classrooms and revenue that will help deliver a record $15.7 billion property tax cut for the people of Texas.\" The Statesman story continued: \"The plan cuts property tax rates for school operations by one-third over two years. It adds $1 per pack to the cigarette tax. The plan will cut more in taxes than it brings in, and it includes $1.5 billion in increased school spending, including $2,000 pay raises for teachers.\" Considine stressed to us by email that there was still a net tax decrease thanks to the 2006 actions. The record-breaking part of Dewhurst's blog-post claim rings true. We recalled only one other substantial statewide property-tax break. The 1997 Legislature sent voters a proposed constitutional amendment, subsequently adopted, increasing from $5,000 to $15,000 the residential homestead exemption from school property taxes, a change then estimated to save a typical Texas homeowner about $12 a month, according to a July 1997 report by the House Research Organization. That report also said: \"The net result would be one of the largest tax reductions in state history.\" By email, school finance expert Joe Wisnoski of Austin offered his ballpark estimate that the 1997 actions have a current-day annual value of about $$650 million to $700 million with the annual value of the 2006 tax-rate actions being far more--at least $6 billion, he said. Finally, we identified no reason to believe Dewhurst didn\u2019t support all the tax-cut proposals passed into law on his watch. He\u2019s a long-time Republican leader in the Republican-steered Capitol. But he didn\u2019t personally cut any taxes. He had no vote on the listed measures--those belonged to senators and House members. On the other hand, his powers include the appointment of pivotal Senate committees, the reference of individual proposals to particular committees and the setting of the Senate's floor agenda. He was a gavel-wielding player."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label Erv Nelson as having voted \"yes\" on Senate Joint Resolution 21. The resolution passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of the Legislature in 2015 and urges Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country. While Seaman's campaign argues that calling the resolution \"pro-amnesty\" is harder to prove, the resolution itself lists facts about immigration and urges Congress to take up the issue, including a clear path to citizenship. The use of the word \"amnesty\" in this context is contentious and there is no agreed upon metric by which it should be used. However, the resolution does not provide any punishment or legal relief for those residing illegally in the country, which is the definition of amnesty. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it is accurate to label Erv Nelson as having voted \"yes\" on a bill that included support for a pathway to citizenship.",
    "doc": "The federal immigration debate is turning into a down-ballot issue in Nevada. Assembly freshmen Erv Nelson and Victoria Seaman are entwined in an ugly Republican primary battle for a critical state Senate seat that holds the potential to tip the balance in the 11-10 Republican-controlled state Senate. Seaman has relentlessly attacked Nelson, and one of her campaign flyers accuses him of supporting a \"pro-amnesty\" immigration bill. \"Why did Erv Nelson vote yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country?\" Because immigration is an important topic in Nevada \u2014 a state with a \"top share of unauthorized immigrants\" \u2014 we wanted to fact-check this claim. The accusation leads back to a resolution approved by bipartisan majorities in both houses of the Legislature in 2015: Senate Joint Resolution 21. Nelson voted for the resolution, while Seaman and 10 other Assembly Republicans voted \"no.\" It passed unanimously in the Senate. The only Assembly member to comment on the resolution\u2019s passage was Republican Michele Fiore, who called it a \"warm and fuzzy feel-good bill\" only to be used for \"political benefit\" in future elections. \"Since it basically does nothing, I urge my fellow colleagues to support SJR 21,\" she said during a marathon Assembly session shortly before midnight on May 22, 2015. The resolution is straightforward. It\u2019s little more than two pages listing facts about immigration and urging Congress to take up the issue, and to include \"earned legal residency accompanied by a clear path to citizenship.\" It rehashes similar legislation also approved by bipartisan majorities in 2013. So claiming Nelson voted for a bill that included support for a pathway to citizenship is accurate, as the resolution clearly spells out. But calling the resolution \"pro-amnesty\" is harder to prove. In response to questions from PolitiFact, Seaman\u2019s campaign sent a two-page letter arguing that a pathway to citizenship is equal to amnesty, as \"citizenship is a measure of permanent legal relief targeted at a specific group of people.\" Use of the word \"amnesty\" in immigration policy is contentious, and there\u2019s no agreed upon metric by which the word should be used. PolitiFact did look into use of the word \"amnesty\" by Republicans critical of President Barack Obama\u2019s proposed immigration policies in 2011 and 2012, but it\u2019s much more difficult due to differences in the 1,200-page immigration bill in 2013 and the two-page resolution approved by lawmakers in 2015. In general, amnesty is defined as granting permanent immunity from punishment for a group of people who have broken the law. It\u2019s true that granting citizenship to people not legally in the country would prevent punishments like deportation and broadly serve as \"amnesty\", but the resolution is just so vague that it\u2019s difficult to call it \"pro-amnesty.\" A 2011 PolitiFact check found that use of the politicallycharged word is \"debatable and so charged it should come with a lot more explanation.\" The resolution additionally doesn\u2019t really do anything other than, in the words of one supporter, \"send a strong message to Congress\" to take up immigration reform. Nelson didn\u2019t answer multiple calls seeking comment, but neither candidate played much of a role on any of the 2015 bills that could have actually affected the undocumented immigrant community. Both lawmakers voted for a successful measure making it easier for immigrants with temporary legal status to get a teacher\u2019s license in Nevada. And neither Seaman nor Nelson played a role in a measure prohibiting contractors from hiring unauthorized immigrants, which failed to pass out of committee. Ultimately, there just isn\u2019t a lot that state-level lawmakers can do on immigration policy outside of \"symbolic\" gestures like the immigration reform resolution, as it\u2019s almost entirely a federally managed issue. Nevada did approve driver authorization cards for people not legally in the country in 2013, but neither Seaman nor Nelson was in office at the time. It\u2019s worth noting that Seaman appears to have voted for the resolution during an earlier committee meeting, according to legislative records requested by PolitiFact. A video of the meeting is online, but it\u2019s difficult to tell if she\u2019s present during the voice vote. That isn\u2019t necessarily an endorsement, as many lawmakers will vote to get legislation out of committee to the floor so more lawmakers can weigh in. Seaman\u2019s campaign manager claims she was not in the room during the vote."

    "doc": "A misleading story on Facebook said that an FBI raid led to White House staffers losing their jobs. \"Breaking: FBI just raided the White House, 6 people thrown out,\" stated a headline by the New Century Times, a left-leaning website, on Dec. 30. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat fake news. While staffers were removed from the White House, that happened nearly a year ago and by calling it a \"raid\" over dramatizes the actual news. The same story appeared on another website in February. The story by New Century Times said that an intelligence agency decided to fight back and sent Trump a message by escorting six staffers out of the White House for failing background investigations. By calling the event an \"FBI raid\" it conjures up an image of armed personnel storming the White House to take out suspicious staffers. But that\u2019s not the way it sounded in news reports. The website attributed much of the information to Western Journalism, which describes itself as a source of conservative and libertarian news. In reality, the story traces back to an article in Politico. Western Journalism reported Feb. 16 that the six staffers were escorted from the White House for problems with their SF86 application, a questionnaire for national security positions. The questionnaire, more than 100 pages long, includes questions on the applicant\u2019s employment, criminal and residential history and also asks about personal subjects such as about an applicant\u2019s mental health and use of illicit drugs. The Western Journalism article followed an article by Politico, which reported based on unnamed sources that some of the aides were \"walked out of the building by security.\" One of the six staffers was Caroline Wiles, the daughter of Susan Wiles, Trump\u2019s Florida campaign director, Politico reported. Caroline Wiles, who resigned before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She was slated to get another job in Treasury."

    "doc": "There is plenty of blame to go around for the government\u2019s failure to create jobs, according to U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta. But little of it falls on Congress, the New Hampshire Republican said last week as he filed for re-election.\"It is frustrating. Now, in the House of Representatives, we have 40 different jobs bills that have passed and almost all of them have been bipartisan,\" Guinta said June 13, 2012 after he filed his re-election papers with the N.H. Secretary of State. \"That\u2019s significant.\"It\u2019s not hard to believe that Congress passed 40 jobs bills during the 2011-12 session. But, with all the partisan gridlock coming out of Washington, are a majority of them really bipartisan? We decided to check the Congressional voter rolls.First, we went first to Guinta\u2019s office, which identified a list of jobs-related bills that have passed the House as part of the House Republicans\u2019 Plan for American Job Creators.The list, published on House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s website, includes 42 pieces of legislation proposing to rework the country\u2019s tax code, to repeal business regulations and to increase access to energy, among other actions. We are well aware that the two parties define \"jobs bills\" differently, due to philosophical differences about what sorts of policies are useful for expanding jobs. (We address this question here.) However, for this item, we will use Cantor\u2019s list while acknowledging that it\u2019s not the final word on what constitutes a jobs bill.Of the total 42 bills, 11 of which were signed into law by President Barack Obama, at least 38 received some level of support from both parties, according to searches of THOMAS, the Library of Congress\u2019 searchable database. Vote totals for two of the bills were unavailable.Some bills, including H.R. 2433, the Veterans Opportunity to Work Act, drew strong support from both sides of the aisle; 235 Republican votes and 183 from Democrats. And, H.R. 3606, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, earned support from 232 Republicans and 183 Democrats. Both bills have become law.But other proposals drew only a handful of votes from the minority party. H.R. 10, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, for instance, passed the House with 237 Republican votes and four Democratic votes. And, H.R. 658, the FAA Transportation Modernization & Safety Improvement Act, passed with 221 Republican votes and only two from Democrats. The transportation act was signed into law, while the regulations act has stalled in the Senate.Further, the Fiscal Year 2012 and 2013 budget proposals, known as the Ryan budget plans, both passed the House without any Democratic support.So, this begs the question, what makes a bill bipartisan?In Guinta\u2019s view, bipartisan legislation means any bill that reflects the interests of members of both parties.\"Bipartisanship is being able to stay true to your principles, while finding common ground to work together on issues you can find agreement on,\" Derek Dufrense, Guinta\u2019s legislative assistant, wrote in an email statement.This definition has been used for decades by politicians looking to tout their bipartisan credentials. But, political scientists, analysts and journalists take a different view.Though there is no formal definition for a bipartisan bill, many political scientists defer to the terms defined by Congressional Quarterly Roll Call, the Washington publication group which has long tracked partisan bills as those that receive support from less than 50 percent of both parties, which would be at least 121 votes from Republicans and 85 votes from Democrats.\"If you take the inverse, that gives you a good sense of how partisan things are,\" said David Hawkings, editor of CQ\u2019s Daily Briefing.\"When I first came to town 25 years ago, you wouldn\u2019t refer to something as having a bipartisan tone to it unless it had a few dozen members of both party. Today, you hear \u2018bipartisan\u2019 when there\u2019s only five, six members of the minority party,\" Hawkings said. \"That\u2019s the new reality.\"Under the CQ terms, six of the 42 jobs bills meet the publication\u2019s 50 percent standard, earning votes from half the members of each party.They are:-- H.R. 2433 and H.R. 3606, referenced above.-- H. Res. 72, Review of Federal Regulations: 238 Republican votes, 153 Democrats-- H.R. 674, 3% Withholding Rule Repeal: 295 Republicans, 170 Democrats; passed the Senate, signed into law.-- H.R. 1249, the America Invents Act: 168 Republicans, 136 Democrats; passed the Senate, signed into law.-- H.R. 4105, Applying Countervailing Duty to Nonmarket Economy Countries: 294 Republicans, 176 Democrats; passed the Senate, signed into law.A 50 percent threshold is pretty high in today's polarized environment, but even if you reduce it to at least 25 percent support from both parties, only 10 bills qualified.\"There are a number of ways you could talk about it, but having only a handful of members of the opposite party, that seems like a big, big stretch,\" said James Pigg, director of the Waggonner Center for Bipartisan Politics and Public Policy at Louisiana Tech University. \"I\u2019d have a hard time calling that bipartisan.\""

The evidence provided contradicts Newt Gingrich's statement. A study conducted for the American Petroleum Institute, an oil industry trade group, estimated that complying with new emissions standards could increase gasoline prices by 12 to 25 cents per gallon. However, this study was initiated before the EPA made its intentions known, and the EPA has since said it is only exploring changes in sulfur levels, not a price increase. Additionally, another study examining the impacts of Tier 3 found that reducing gasoline sulfur content would have a less than one cent per gallon cost. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it is unlikely that President Obama's EPA proposal would raise the price of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon.",
    "doc": "What better way to scare American voters than tell them the government wants them to pay 25 cents a gallon more for gas?In an appearance on Meet the Press on Feb. 5, 2012, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich argued that President Obama\u2019s policies have \"weakened the country.\"Prime example: \"He has an Environmental Protection Agency proposal that would raise the price of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon. There are very few Americans who want to see the price of gasoline raised by government ... 25 cents a gallon.\"We think Gingrich is probably right about that second part. We decided to look further into the first.EPA and reducing tailpipe emissionsGingrich\u2019s campaign spokesman, R.C. Hammond, directed us to recent news coverage of the EPA\u2019s proposed \"Tier 3\" regulations on fuel emissions.The regulations are part of Obama\u2019s multi-year plan to reduce tailpipe pollution. Initially, his administration created the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas requirements for trucks. Next the administration set such standards for cars, light trucks, and sport-utility vehicles, called \"light-duty vehicles,\" for model years 2017- 2025, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.Now, the EPA is working to create a new set of emissions standards to reduce pollution from these light-duty vehicles. These would update standards that EPA set in 1999.But the potential costs of the new regulations have some politicians up in arms. Hammond pointed us to a letter signed by six U.S. senators to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson raising concerns about the proposed action.\"With gasoline prices already high, and with so many Americans already struggling to make ends meet, we urge you to recognize that now is not the time for new regulations that will raise the price of fuel even further,\" the letter stated. It went on to cite a study by the consulting firm Baker & O\u2019Brien, which estimated capital and annual costs of complying with the new regulations of $17 billion and $13 billion respectively and predicted oil refinery closures and an increase in gasoline prices of 12 to 25 cents per gallon.That\u2019s where Gingrich\u2019s 25-cent statement came from. But there are some important things to know about this study.First, it was conducted for the American Petroleum Institute, an oil industry trade group.\"At the very least, industry-sponsored studies (and interest-group sponsored studies, for that matter) should always be taken with a grain of salt,\" said David Jenkins, vice president for government and political affairs for Republicans for Environmental Protection. \"Candidates should not be reciting such studies as gospel, since they know, or should know, that a study can be engineered to produce whatever results the sponsor would like by tweaking the choice of assumptions.\"Second, the Baker & O\u2019Brien study assumes two major changes in the standards: lowering the sulfur content in gasoline and adjusting something called Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), a measure of fuel volatility.But the study was initiated before the EPA made its intentions known, according to Michelle Robinson with the Union of Concerned Scientists. Now, the EPA has said it is only exploring changes in sulfur levels.Baker & O\u2019Brien\u2019s conclusions were based on four scenarios, all of which assumed lower RVP requirements.Robinson wrote in an email that \"while the API study did not distinguish the costs of reducing the RVP from the costs of lowering sulfur content, a review of the report indicates that most of the costs are due to the RVP reduction.\"That means that the biggest chunk of the costs are expected from a change that EPA has said it isn\u2019t seeking.Said Robinson: \"The oil industry study is dramatically overstating the cleanup costs because it is based on a false premise.\"Other evidenceWe found another study examining the impacts of Tier 3, commissioned by the International Council for Clean Transportation, a nonprofit foundation that seeks to improve transportation efficiency in order to reduce climate change. This study specifically included a scenario which allowed the gasoline sulfur improvement to be isolated from the RVP improvement, Robinson told us.Conducted by the refinery consulting firm MathPro, this study concluded that the priceof reducing the average gasoline sulfur content would be less than one cent per gallon.EPA did not respond to our inquiry, but in several published reports we found references to remarks by Margo Oge of EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality. She said Jan. 26, 2012, at the Washington Auto Show that the oil industry\u2019s cost projections were based costs of a program that \"EPA is not planning to propose.\""

Patrick Murphy, that \"In about three weeks over a half million Floridians are going to lose their coverage again\" through Obamacare is Conflicting.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article supports this label. Firstly, Bloomberg News reported that nationwide, more than 1 million people will lose plans due to withdrawals by health insurance companies from the individual marketplace where people can shop for policies. Of these, the largest number of losses will be in Florida with over 400,000 individuals expected to lose their coverage. This suggests that a significant portion of Floridians will indeed lose their coverage due to the withdrawal of insurance companies from the marketplace.\n\nHowever, the article also provides an explanation for why this loss of coverage is not necessarily a bad thing. According to Timothy Jost, author of the Health Affairs Blog and emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law, while some Floridians will lose their current plan, they will still be insured as they can sign up for another plan. Jost notes that the premium could be similar for most shoppers since the amount is based on tax credits that are set based on a consumer's income. He also points out that while the state said that premiums will increase on average 19%, this is before the tax credits that apply to many buying on the marketplace.\n\nDavid Himmelstein, professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College, also notes that while some Floridians may have to change insurers, it is not necessarily a bad thing as they will still be insured and have access to healthcare. He acknowledges that some may end up with worse or more expensive coverage, but argues that this is not the same as losing coverage entirely.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that while some Floridians will lose their current coverage due to the withdrawal of insurance companies from the marketplace, they will still have access to healthcare through other plans. Therefore, the label Conflicting is appropriate for Senator Rubio's claim.",
    "doc": "U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., continued his attacks on Obamacare during the first U.S. Senate debate against his Democratic rival, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy. Rubio said that Obamacare has \"enormous problems.\" \"No. 1, it is running up our debt.No. 2, people are losing their coverage. In about three weeks over a half million Floridians are going to lose their coverage again,\" he said. \"It is collapsing under its own weight because it doesn\u2019t work.\" We will fact-check if that many Floridians are poised to lose their health care plans. Obamacare plans Bloomberg Newsreported Oct. 14 thatnationwide, more than 1 million people will lose plans -- and the largest number of losses will be in Florida with more than 400,000. Bloomberg interviewed state regulators and learneda few health insurance companies are quitting the marketplace where people can shop for policies. Sign up for coverage begins in November. In August,Aetna announced that it would stop selling Obamacare plans in 11 states, including Florida for 2017, due to significant financial losses. UnitedHealth is exiting the individual market, and Humana will withdraw from most of the counties it serves in the individual market. As of May 9, approximately 420,000 enrollees in Florida are expected to lose their plans due to withdrawals in the individual exchange marketplace with additional enrollees losing coverage off-exchange, according to Karen Kees, a spokeswoman for the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Floridians who lose their plan can sign up for another one. Fifteen insurance companies have filed requests to sell individual coverage plans in Florida,including 11 insurers that requested to sell plans on the exchange. \"It\u2019s not 400,000 are going to be uninsured. (It\u2019s) 400,000 are going to have to switch insurers,\" saidTimothy Jost, author of the Health Affairs Blog and emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law. And many people each year change plans any way when they seek out a better deal, he said. The premium could be similar for most shoppers since the amount is based on tax credits that are set based on a consumer\u2019s income, Jost said. While the state said that premiums will increase on average 19 percent, Jost said that is before the tax credits that apply to many buying on the marketplace. Jost said the irony in the disruption is that Rubio pushed to defund the risk corridor program that was intended to stabilize the market so that plans that made big profits would pay in and those with big losses would collect. In the end, those funds were limited. \"Rubio has to take a lot of credit for Floridians losing coverage,\" Jost said. \"Had the program operated the way it was intended to operate, a lot more insurers would still be in the marketplace.\" Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said while these Floridians will still be insured a new plan could mean changes for them. \"Yes, they will get something of similar price and quality, but it won\u2019t necessarily be in the same network, it may not cover their current doctor,\" he said. However, it is deceptive to say Floridians will \"lose\" coverage without explaining that they will get a new plan, said David Himmelstein, professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College. \"Many Floridians will have to change insurers,\" he said. \"Some will likely have worse, or more expensive coverage -- although we don't know how many at present. Is that losing coverage? I don't think most people would characterize it that way.\" Nationwide, most consumers will have multiple choices but fewer than in the past, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found. Rubio made a similar misleading statement before about people losing health care. In 2013, Rubio said that \"300,000 people are going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don\u2019t have health insurance.\" Since Florida Blue provided assistance with switching plans, we rated Rubio\u2019s statement Mostly False because he jumped the gun by saying flatly that they wouldn\u2019t have insurance. Ultimately,more than 80 percent of the approximately 300,000 members remained with Florida Blue. This time, Florida Blue is expected to pick up many of those who will lose coverage with another carrier. Florida Blue currently has about 700,000 people covered through the marketplace, which is more than any other carrier, spokesman Doug Bartel said. It will continue to offer plans in every Florida county. \"We fully expect based upon our products, price, network and benefits that we will pick up many of the consumers whose insurance company is leaving the marketplace,\" he said. Rubio\u2019s debate statement also ignores that due to the Affordable Care Act, more Floridians have coverage. More than 1.7 million Floridians purchased plans through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplaces between Nov. 1, 2015, and Feb. 1, 2016. So that\u2019s more than the400,000 who will \"lose\" their plan -- and they aren\u2019t actually going to lose insurance. Federal data shows that the percentage of insured in Florida has been steadily dropping. In 2013, 20 percent of Floridians lacked health coverage. In 2014, that number fell to 16.6 percent, and in 2015, it fell again to 13.3 percent. The majority of Americans still get their insurance through their employer -- not the individual marketplace."

Therefore, the claim is conflicting because while Mexico receives a large amount of remittances, other countries receive a higher percentage of their GDP in remittances.",
    "doc": "While President Donald Trump maintains that Mexico will pay for a border wall, Republican lawmakers are looking for other ways to help fund the president\u2019s signature campaign promise. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., introduced the Border Wall Funding Act of 2017 to levy a 2 percent fee on money sent by individuals in the United States to recipients in nations \"south of the U.S. border,\" funds known as remittances. \"This bill is simple \u2013 anyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall,\" Rogers said in a March 30 press release. He added some large numbers about remittances to bolster his case. \"Remittances, or wire transfers, are commonly used by illegal immigrants to move money from the U.S. to their home countries,\" Rogers said. \"In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the U.S., while other South and Central American countries received over 15 percent of their GDPs in the form of remittances.\" Remittances serve as a source of income for migrants\u2019 families who generally use the money to pay for housing, food and other living expenses. To an extent, Rogers\u2019 two-fold statement is backed by data. The exception is his point about South America \u2014 we could not find any countries on that continent with remittances anywhere near 15 percent of GDP. Money sent to Mexico checks out Rogers\u2019 bill seeks to tax immigrants living in the United States illegally who send money back to their countries, according to a press release from his office. The text of the bill itself does not explicitly address how people here unlawfully could be targeted. Experts have told us that while undocumented immigrants do send remittances, it\u2019s hard to determine how much they send, since U.S. citizens and immigrants living here legally also send money. Mexico receives more money from U.S. residents than does any other nation, by far. Rogers\u2019 statement about remittances sent to Mexico is based on data from the World Bank. The World Bank has for several years estimated the bilateral flow of remittances from its member countries. The latest number is actually higher than what Rogers said. Mexico received more than $25.6 billion in remittances from individuals in the United States in 2015, according to the most recent World Bank estimates. Mexico also topped the list as the country receiving the most remittances from the United States from 2010-15, according to a May 2016 Congressional Research Service report. China came in second and India placed third. Money sent to South and Central American countries Rogers claimed that some South and Central American countries receive more than 15 percent of their gross domestic product, or GDP, in the form of remittances. We asked what countries he had in mind. A spokesperson pointed to Haiti, a poor island in the Caribbean, as well as Honduras and El Salvador in Central America. (The spokesperson added that Rogers' statement was actually based on 2015 data, not 2014.) A country\u2019s GDP is an indicator of the health and size of its economy. Comparing remittances to a country\u2019s GDP can be helpful in understanding the economic effects of foreign labor migration and money sent to residents across countries. In other words, a large remittance total may be less eye-popping when it\u2019s compared to the broader economy \u2014 and vice versa. \"For example, if I tell you that in 2015, Mexico received $26 billion in remittances and Haiti received $2.2 billion, you might think that remittances are far more important to the Mexican economy than they are to Haiti's,\" said Roy Germano, a New York University professor who has researched migrants\u2019 remittances. \"But the fact is, Mexico's economy is much larger than Haiti's (as is its population).\" Remittances to Haiti represent a much greater share of income for the country than they do in Mexico. In 2015, remittances from the United States accounted for more than 15 percent of Haiti\u2019s GDP and about 2.2 percent of Mexico\u2019s GDP. Small island states or small, impoverished countries are most likely to have shares of remittances at 15 percent or more of GDP, said Catalina Amuedo-Dorantes, professor and chair of the economics department at San Diego State University. Tajikistan, in Central Asia, has depended on remittances since years-long armed conflict in the 1990s claimed more than 100,000 lives, noted the Congressional Research Service\u2019s report. Tajikistan topped a CRS list as the country with the greatest percentage of its 2014 GDP in form of remittances (from all places), at nearly 42 percent. Rogers\u2019 office did not provide any examples of countries from South America with remittances via the United States that amount to more than 15 percent of GDP. We crunched the numbers for South America and found that none came close to 15 percent. Here\u2019s a sample: Percent of Guyana\u2019s GDP in form of remittances? 5.9 percent. Ecuador: 1.02 percent. Colombia: 0.5 percent. Bolivia: 0.4 percent. Brazil: 0.04 percent Venezuela: 0.01 percent (based on 2013 GDP/remittances data)"

    "claim": "Under Obamacare, people who \"have a doctor they\u2019ve been seeing for the last 15 or 20 years, they won\u2019t be able to keep going to that doctor.\"",

    "justification": "The claim made by Senator Marco Rubio that people who have a doctor they've been seeing for 15 or 20 years will not be able to keep going to that doctor under Obamacare is partially accurate but also misleading. While it is true that some patients may face challenges in keeping their current doctor under the Affordable Care Act, the evidence provided in the article suggests that this effect will not be limited to Obamacare alone.\n\nExperts agree that there are already ways in which people can lose access to their doctor, even without the Affordable Care Act. For instance, companies can switch health care plans, and some employees' doctors may not be in the new network. Additionally, employees can lose their job - or switch jobs - and end up with a different plan that doesn't include the same doctor. These changes are already happening due to natural job turnover, and they will continue to occur even after the Affordable Care Act is implemented.\n\nThe article also provides evidence that the health care law leaves in place the current health insurance system, so switching plans and possibly doctors will still happen. However, the law also puts more requirements on insurance companies, which means that they have to offer more comprehensive coverage. This could lead to some patients finding new doctors through their insurance plans.\n\nWhile it is true that some patients may find themselves in a situation where their new plan isn't in the network, the article provides examples of how this can happen under current circumstances as well. Therefore, while Senator Rubio's claim has some truth to it, it is also misleading to suggest that Obamacare will cause a significant number of patients to lose access to their current doctors.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is partially accurate to say that people who have a doctor they've been seeing for 15 or 20 years may face challenges in keeping that doctor under Obamacare. However, it is also important to recognize that this effect will not be limited to the Affordable Care Act and that there are already ways in which patients can lose access to their doctors due to natural job turnover and changes in health insurance plans.",
    "doc": "Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., calls Obamacare a \"broken and failed experiment.\" In an interview with Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity on July 31, Rubio railed against the health care law, saying it would hurt regular folks. \"Just think about the people that have health insurance now, and they\u2019re happy with it. They\u2019re going to lose that health insurance. They have a doctor they\u2019ve been seeing for the last 15 or 20 years, they won\u2019t be able to keep going to that doctor,\" he said. Rubio\u2019s claim that insured patients will have to stop seeing their long-time doctors caught our attention, so we decided to check it out. We asked a Rubio spokesman for an explanation and did not get a response. Even without Obamacare patients sometimes have to switch doctors If we set aside the health care law, there are already ways that people can end up losing access to their doctor now. Companies can switch health care plans, and some employees\u2019 doctors may not be in the new network. Employees can lose their job -- or switch jobs -- and end up with a different plan that doesn\u2019t include the same doctor. Switching jobs -- and therefore, potentially health insurance -- can happen often. In 2012, the median job tenure was 5.4 years, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. \"It's hard to imagine many people on the same health plan for 15-20 years given natural job turnover,\" said Paul Fronstin, senior research associate at Employee Benefit Research Institute. The health care law leaves in place the current health insurance system, so switching plans and possibly doctors will still happen. The law also puts more requirements on insurance companies, so that they have to offer more comprehensive coverage. For people who are uninsured or have to buy insurance on their own, the law creates state-by-state health insurance exchanges where people can buy their own insurance. These new options mean people may end up switching health plans, and that could mean switching doctors. But experts on the health care law told us it\u2019s difficult to predict how many will fall into that category. There are many factors at play, including the particular insurance plan, geography and if the patient shops for a plan on the exchange. \"Most people are not going to be affected, at least in the short term,\" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. \"Will it be huge numbers? Probably not. Will some people find they can\u2019t keep their current doctor? Yes.\" If Rubio wants to protect people from involuntary changes in their doctors, \"the best remedy is to abandon the current employer-based insurance system and to provide insurance on some other basis -- e.g., a single-insurer system of the kind they have in Canada,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. Now let\u2019s examine the possibilities as it relates to Obamacare: \u2022Employers that offer health insurance: It\u2019s possible that employers will switch their health care plans and that a new plan won\u2019t include some employees\u2019 current doctors in network. But that was already the case before Obamacare. \"If the ACA results in more employers switching plans, it is possible that more people will be in a situation where their new plan isn't in the network, but I've seen nothing that quantifies this,\" Fronstin said. It\u2019s also possible that some large employers could decide to drop their plan and pay the penalty, forcing employees to buy insurance from the exchanges. Also, a small employer who won\u2019t face a penalty could drop their plan, sending workers to the exchanges. But industry experts are not expecting the changes to be particularly widespread. Barry Schilmeister, a health care actuary and senior consultant at Mercer, said that \"it's not likely that employers will be making a lot more carrier changes than in the past, if they're keeping their traditional programs (which most are, for now).\" \u2022 Exchanges: A patient\u2019s current doctor may not be available through some -- or potentially any -- of the plans offered on the exchanges. There are lots of different scenarios here. A patient\u2019s doctor might be on an exchange plan, but the consumer might choose a cheaper alternative instead that doesn\u2019t cover that doctor. If that consumer truly couldn\u2019t afford the plan covering their doctor, we might call that being \"forced\" to switch doctors, but if someone simply chooses to save money, then they are making a choice. Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said that there is some truth to Rubio\u2019s claim, because there is the potential for some patients to lose access to their doctor. But she said at this point, it\u2019s not possible to predict how many people that will happen to in the first year of the exchange -- or beyond. \"Just like private plans now don\u2019t include all the doctors, many doctors may not choose to be in the plans offered in the exchanges,\" she told PolitiFact. That \"will depend on which companies participate in the exchanges, whether they have a relationship with those plans, and the payment rates that the plan will use for the exchange. Many states have pushed plan premiums way below what the companies thought it would take and may come in with narrow networks to live within those rates.\" News reports indicate that some health care insurance companies are forgoing some state exchanges, at least for now. Aetna announced Aug. 2 that it was pulling out of Maryland\u2019s individual exchange. We interviewed spokespersons at a few health care companies and learned that United Health plans to participate in about a dozen exchanges, while Aetna plans to join about 14. Cigna currently offers individual plans in 10 states and has chosen half for initial participation in exchanges. This means for consumers who now have a particular insurance company and have to buy a plan on the exchange, \"whether your doctor might be on other plans is a crapshoot -- maybe yes, maybe no,\" Wilensky said. \u2022 Medicare: Jeff Johnson, state director of Florida AARP, said that nothing in the Affordable Care Act would force patients on Medicare to switch doctors. Future changes to Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors \"could affect doctors getting out of Medicare.\" However, that has been an issue years before Obamacare. The \"sustainable growth rate\" passed into law under President Bill Clinton is supposed to set Medicare reimbursement costs but is routinely bypassed by Congress. \"The Affordable Care Act did not include a permanent fix to that,\" he said. Judith Stein, executive director of Center for Medicare Advocacy, said every year doctors decide whether to continue serving patients on Medicare or Medicare Advantage -- and that\u2019s unrelated to Obamacare. With Medicare Advantage, doctors consider how many of their patients are on the plan, reimbursement rates and administrative hassles \"It may be your Medicare Advantage plan may not include your doctor next year, but not because of Obamacare. ... That has always been the case and continues to be the case.\""

Therefore, it is not possible to accurately determine the percentage of jobs created in Texas specifically for illegal aliens based on the evidence provided. As such, the claim is labeled as conflicting.",
    "doc": "During the Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, Mitt Romney sought to undermine Texas Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s argument that he\u2019s presided over rapid job creation during his tenure.\"If you look over the last several years, 40 percent, almost half the jobs created in Texas, were created for illegal aliens, illegal immigrants,\" Romney said.Romney was referring to a study titled, \"Who Benefited from Job Growth In Texas? A Look at Employment Gains for Immigrants and the Native-Born, 2007 to 2011,\" published by the Center for Immigration Studies, a research group that supports reducing illegal immigration.The report analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data and found that immigrants, both legal and illegal, \"have been the primary beneficiaries\" of job growth in Texas since 2007, even though native-born workers accounted for 69 percent of the growth in the state\u2019s working-age population over the same period.Specifically, the report said that, of the jobs created in Texas since 2007, 81 percent were taken by newly arrived immigrant workers, both legal and illegal. In the meantime, the group estimated that about half of the newly arrived immigrants who took jobs in Texas beginning in 2007 were illegal.As a result, the report estimated that about 40 percent of job growth in Texas since 2007 went to newly arrived illegal immigrants.So Romney\u2019s comment described the results of the study pretty faithfully, though it would have been more accurate if he\u2019d referred to jobs \"given to illegal aliens,\" rather than \"created for illegal aliens.\" The study doesn\u2019t suggest that Texas employers were conspiring to create jobs specifically for illegal immigrants, only that illegal immigrants ended up filling them.However, we see two additional issues that call into question the accuracy of the study itself:The 40 percent figure uses gross numbers of immigrants rather than net numbers.The report actually offered calculations using two sets of numbers -- one using the total number of immigrants coming into the state, and the other using that number minus the number of immigrant departures and deaths. Using the net immigrant figure -- the one Romney didn\u2019t use -- results in a lower percentage.The figure using net immigration is about 54 percent. And once you divide that by two to estimate the share for illegal immigrants, the relevant number is about 27 percent, not 40 percent.So Romney has effectively cherry-picked the higher of two percentages offered in the report.Both the 40 percent figure and the 27 percent figure are subject to a wide margin of error.Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, an independent research organization, said that \"there are lots of methodological problems with the CIS study, mainly having to do with the limitations of small sample sizes and the fact that the estimates are determined by taking differences of differences based on small sample sizes.\" In addition, the assumption that 50 percent of immigrants are illegal is an educated guess, but still a guess.Meanwhile, the Census data used in the report is a longitudinal survey, which means that Census employees check back periodically with the same participants. \"How many undocumented folks do you honestly think would be participating in that?\" asks Sarah Jane Glynn, a policy analyst with the liberal Center for American Progress.Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, added that the report did not drill deeper into the data than \"working age.\"\"Even within the working-age population, it might be the case that the immigrant population may have disproportionately grown in age groups -- say, ages 25-49 -- where employment rates are highest,\" he said. \"A really sophisticated analysis might show that, given the age distribution of net immigrant population growth and net native population growth, immigrants got exactly the proportion of new jobs a good forecaster would predict.\" Given the data, though, we \"just don\u2019t know,\" he said.The report does acknowledge that \"no estimate of illegal immigration is exact.\" But the methodological shortcomings also weaken the certainty of Romney\u2019s statistic.On balance, we think that both the report\u2019s authors and its critics have reasonable points.In the big picture, we agree with Chuck DeVore -- a conservative critic of the study -- that \"trying to draw conclusions about immigration and employment in Texas in isolation from other factors is problematic at best.\"But we also agree with Mark Krikorian, the Center for Immigration Studies\u2019 executive director, that \"even if DeVore prefers a net-to-net comparison, immigrants still got a disproportionate share of new jobs.\""

    "doc": "A popular yet unsubstantiated Facebook post claims that the United States has not detained, let alone deported, any white immigrants. \"Since ICE has not deported or detained one white illegal immigrant, which there are 600,000 of...can we admit this is about race?\" said the Aug. 15 post, shared at least 87,000 times as of Sept. 24. A reader wanted to know if it was really true that no white immigrants have been deported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. There\u2019s no evidence for that. The Facebook post does not include any sources, and we did not find corresponding news stories or government data to support it. ICE does not track deportations based on race or ethnicity. The agency has statistics on where people are sent, but that alone doesn\u2019t indicate someone\u2019s race. Pew Research Center estimated that in 2017 there were 9.75 million unauthorized people ages 18 and older. Of 9.75 million people, about 700,000 were white (not Hispanic), according to Pew. PRI in July 2017 published a story about a man from Ireland deported from the United States for overstaying the length of his visa. The story identifies the deported man, John Cunningham, as a white immigrant. In addition to Cunningham, another man from Ireland who lived in the United States illegally and a representative from Boston's Irish International Immigrant Center, \"all acknowledged that, as white men, they can fly under the radar of those who associate unauthorized immigrants with Mexico and Central America,\" the PRI story said. A year before ICE arrested Cunningham, he told PRI: \"Most people think undocumented and they think people who come across the southern border. They\u2019re not thinking about the Irish guy who lives right next to them. They don\u2019t see that part of it, but we have to live with that every day.\" NPR in January 2018 also reported that a then-19-year-old man from Ireland, Dylan O\u2019Riordan, had been detained by ICE and was scheduled to be deported. \"O'Riordan didn't necessarily think being white would save him from deportation orders. He thought staying out of trouble would keep him under the radar. He says other detainees are surprised he was arrested,\" the story said. ICE told NPR that O\u2019Riordan overstayed the terms of his admission. In fiscal year 2018, ICE deported close to 260,000 people. The top three countries where people were deported were Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. Hispanics or Latinos (terms used to denote ethnicity) can be of any race, including white. Overall, in 2018 immigrants were deported to countries all over the world, including Norway, Russia, Ireland, Kenya, and China.

Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "In a 40-minute speech to supporters near Knoxville ahead of Super Tuesday, presidential candidate Rick Santorum framed the health care debate in terms of government power versus individual choice.President Barack Obama, he said on Feb. 29, 2012, \"wants that power in the hands of government. He wants to control your insurance policies and your access and the reimbursements to doctors and hospitals and how much insurance companies -- not how much they\u2019ll make, how much they\u2019re allowed to keep of the money they collect.\"That\u2019s already in place by the way. The federal government has a regulation in place already that tells health insurance companies how much money they\u2019re allowed to keep of what they receive in revenues. Fifteen percent -- that\u2019s what they can keep. That\u2019s how much money they get to keep to run their businesses.\"He wrapped up the topic saying, \"they\u2019re going to micromanage everything because they don\u2019t believe in you.\"We decided to check the claim that the federal government allows health insurance companies to keep just 15 percent of their revenues to use for operating expenses.Medical loss ratioSantorum didn\u2019t call it by this name, and we didn\u2019t hear back from his campaign for our story, but it appears he was referring to the medical loss ratio, a provision of the 2010 health care reform law signed by Obama and opposed by congressional Republicans.The provision is similar to others already in place in several states. It \"requires most insurance companies that cover individuals and small businesses to spend at least 80 percent of premium income on health care claims and quality improvement, leaving the remaining 20 percent for administration, marketing, and profit. The \u2026 threshold is higher for large group plans, which must spend at least 85 percent of premium dollars on health care and quality improvement,\" according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. There are other exceptions for small companies. (You can read Kaiser\u2019s full explainer on the medical loss ratio here.)Insurance companies that exceed those limits are required to pay the money back in rebates to their customers, beginning in 2012.With large group plans required to spend 85 percent of premium income on health care, what\u2019s left is the 15 percent to which Santorum referred.According to John Rother at the National Coalition on Health Care, a coalition of trade associations, labor unions and advocacy groups that supports health care reform, the medical loss ratio \"was enacted to put pressure on insurers to become more efficient\" as well as to \"make sure that consumers and businesses got a fair deal on their premiums.\"Timothy Jost, a health law expert at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., called it \"a pro-consumer regulation.\"The idea behind, he said, is that \"when people purchase health insurance, they ought to have the money go to health care.\"Revenue not affectedSantorum referred to health insurers\u2019 overall revenue -- \"what they receive\" -- but the provision applies only to revenue from premiums. In other words, of what you pay your insurer in premiums, 80 or 85 percent must be spent on your health care. It may not pay for television commercials or new office space.But other sources of revenue may be used for those purposes.\"Many (insurance companies) have side businesses, offering IT services and other services that are sold to health providers,\" said Rother.Added Jost: \"Some insurers are heavily invested, and that doesn\u2019t figure in at all.\"\"It\u2019s not that they are limited to 15 percent of their income for all of their expenses. They\u2019re limited in their premium income,\" Jost said.While they may not account for all revenue, Robert Zirkelbach, press secretary for the industry group America's Health Insurance Plans, pointed out that premiums comprise the majority of insurance companies\u2019 revenue.Expenses not affectedSome insurers\u2019 expenses, such as quality improvement efforts, taxes, regulatory fees and patient safety, do not have to come out of the 15 percent.Jost said some things that previously were considered administrative costs are now specifically exempted, namely quality improvement costs that include wellness programs and patient safety.\"It does not limit the insurers\u2019 ability to work with doctors and hospitals to improve quality. Those costs are not charged against the 15 or 20 percent limit,\" Rother said.But Zirkelbach said the cap also encompasses services that affect consumers, including services to help patients navigate complicated delivery systems, efforts to modernize technology and programs to prevent fraud and abuse.His group raised concerns about the medical loss ratio when it was being debated, citing fears it would disrupt the health insurance market and inhibit innovation.A Government Accountability Office study found that the majority of established insurers would have already been in compliance with the medical loss ratio in 2010 if it had been in effect. Thus, most policy holders won\u2019t be getting a rebate this year, Jost said. But they\u2019re also likely avoiding premium rate increases that might have happened without the rule.\"It\u2019s \u2026 fair to say that many insurers are showing that they can meet this requirement without breaking a sweat,\" Rother said."

Many news accounts put the total number of early voting hours in 2008 at 120, but the Department of State calculates it at 116.In 2011, the Legislature passed a sweeping elections lawthat reduced the amount of days for early voting from 14 to eight. The new law gave supervisors a choice of offering between between six and 12 hours of early voting each day. (Here\u2019s a related checkon that.) So local elections supervisors had the choice to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days.The Legislature is poised to tweak the state\u2019s early voting system again in 2013 because of the long waits to vote in some places during the 2012 presidential election.Scott, echoing proposals from the elections supervisors association, recommended the Legislature give supervisors the ability to offer between eight and 14 days of early voting, while maintaining six to 12 hours each day. He also wants to add more early voting sites.So under Scott\u2019s proposal, supervisors would be able to provide a maximum of 168 hours of early voting (14 days multiplied by 12 hours a day). On the flip side, the fewest number of hours they would be required to offer is 48 (eight days multiplied by six hours).Activists behind the liberal campaign Pink Slip Rick disapproved of Scott\u2019s proposal, saying Scott should have restored the number of days for early voting to 14, the way it was before the 2011 election law.\"Anything less than that is not a promise to restore or expand early voting,\" said Amy Ritter, executive director of Florida Watch Action, the liberal group behind Pink Slip Rick.A few election supervisors we interviewed about Scott\u2019s plan said they welcomed the idea of tailoring early voting to their home county\u2019s needs.\"We kind of came to the conclusion that obviously, with Florida being such a huge and diverse state, one size does not fit all,\" said Brian Corley, Pasco County supervisor of elections.Corley, who heads up legislative affairs for the state supervisors association, said he does not think Pasco would need the full 168 hours, but \"it\u2019s nice to have the option, if need be, for a major presidential election.\"A spokeswoman for Broward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes said her office had not yet begun planning for the scenario under Scott\u2019s plan but would probably go back to 14 days of early voting, the way things were before the Legislature\u2019s 2011 law.\"We would likely conduct early voting as it was structured prior to HB 1355,\" said public services director Mary Cooney in an email."

Additionally, the article notes that some teachers may have experienced pay cuts due to changes in the salary schedule. However, these factors do not negate the overall trend of increasing teacher pay under Republican leadership.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim \"Teacher pay has increased under Republican leadership every year for the past 5 years\" is true.",
    "doc": "Teacher pay is always a popular topic around election time. Republicans and Democrats either want credit for any progress being made, or want to blame the other side for any lack of progress. Sen. Michael Lee, a Republican from Wilmington, is gearing up for re-election against Harper Peterson, a former Wilmington mayor.He tweetedon Aug. 28 that \"teacher pay has increased under Republican leadership every year for the past 5 years. In fact, even according to the national teacher\u2019s unions own rankings, NC ranked number 2 in the U.S. for fastest rising teacher pay 2016-2017.\" Did teacher pay increase over the past five years? Here\u2019s the average teacher salary from the past five years: 2013-14: $44,990 2014-15: $47,819 2015-16: $47,985 2016-17: $49,837 2017-18: $50,861 Those teacher salaries also include supplements, but those are provided by the local district and not the General Assembly. The numbers do not take into consideration any rise in health care premiums, cost-of-living or other expenses. The average rate of inflation over the course of these years was 2.3 percent, based on information fromthe Bureau of Labor Statistics. At first glance, it does appear that teachers got a pay raise every year. However, thesalary schedulesfrom the North Carolina Department of Instruction tell a slightly different story. Teachers with 35 years of experience were being paid $52,150 in the2013-14 school year.In the2014-15 school year, the base salary for teachers with 25 years of experience or more dropped to $50,000. The 2016\"Held Harmless\" statutemade sure no teacher would make less in 2016-17 than in 2014-15. So, those teachers did not receive a pay cut in the following years. The average pay did increase every year after the 2013-14 school year. In the2017-18 academic year, teachers with 35 years of experience were paid $51,300. Basically, teachers who reach 35 years of experience today because they are now included in the overall \"25-year-plus\" category. (Clarification: An earlier version of this story said teachers received pay cuts following the 2013-14 academic year. However, we neglected to factor in the \"Held Harmless\" statute that prevents teacher pay cuts.) It\u2019s the same story for teachers with 36 years of experience. They were paid $53,180 in the2013-14 academic year, but teachers who reach 36 years of experience would\u2019ve been paid $50,000 in the 2014-15 academic year. In the2017-18 academic year, these teachers were paid $51,300 as well. The same\"Held Harmless\" statutehas been included in the 2018-19 budgets so no teacher gets a pay cut. In addition, teachers with up to four years were the only ones to get a base salary increase in the2015-16 academic year. They were paid $33,000 in 2014-15, and then paid $35,000 in 2015-16. In the following years, first-year teachers did not see an increase to their base salary. It stayed at $35,000. How fast did teacher pay increase? North Carolina wasranked secondin having the fastest teacher pay raise in 2016-17 nationally, according to theNational Education Association. This is where Lee\u2019s legislative assistant, Emily Barnes, says Lee got his information. However, that hasn\u2019t always been the case. In the2013-14academic year, North Carolina was ranked 48th for percentage change in average teacher salary, with a -1.6 percent change. The state also ranked 41st in the2015-16academic year for teacher pay raises with a 0.3 percent change. North Carolina did rank first in teacherpay raise in 2014-15with a 6.3 percent change from the previous year."

    "doc": "Former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. Santorum said he could support a smaller minimum wage increase, but not the nearly $3 an hour hike the president and other Democrats have called for. \"If you look at the CBO report, half a million people would lose their jobs as a result of the Obama minimum wage increase,\" Santorum said. \"I\u2019m talking more in the range of a dollar, phasing that in.\" Santorum didn\u2019t respond to our request for comment, but we were able to find the February 2014 Congressional Budget Office report he was speaking about. Santorum is largely quoting the report correctly. Obama\u2019s proposed increase would take place in three steps, with the minimum hourly wage hitting $10.10 in 2016. It currently sits at $7.25, but many states choose to pay a higher minimum wage than federal policy mandates. The CBO concluded if the federal government gradually increased the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for all workers, and tied future increases to inflation, the economy would shed 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016 (all things constant under current law). That\u2019s about 0.3 percent of the workforce. CBO reached its conclusion, figuring: Higher wages increase companies\u2019 production costs. In turn, that lowers the amount of goods and services produced. That means companies need to employ fewer workers. Raising the cost of employing low-wage workers encourages companies to focus more on other, more cost-effective ways of producing goods and services: machines, technology and employing productive higher-wage workers. The one thing that Santorum didn't note is that the 500,000-job estimate is just that, an estimate. Job losses could range from hardly any, all the way up to 1 million. It pegged 500,000 jobs as its \"central estimate.\" That\u2019s not to say the CBO report had only bad news about Obama\u2019s proposal. The report also noted that about 16.5 million workers would see their wages go up."

LeMieux served from September 2009 to January 2011.Mack and LeMieux are competing for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate to go against Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson. (Mack is now a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Fort Myers.)Mack\u2019s ad shows President Barack Obama, mixing the president\u2019s remarks with narration about LeMieux.

The law made about $30 billion available to small business, primarily through the Small Business Administration and its lending program for community banks. The law also included $12 billion worth of tax breaks for small business, mostly by changing tax rules on business expenses.Opponents of the law said at the time that the lending program was similar to the Troubled Asset Relief Progam, or TARP. \"It had the mini-TARP in there, with no real help to small businesses, as far as I'm concerned,\" Sen.

    "justification": "The claim that President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had is True. The evidence provided supports this claim. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that tracks campaign donations, President Obama received $44.3 million in direct contributions from the \"finance, insurance and real estate\" sector in 2008, which is adjusted for inflation is $41.1 million in 2008 dollars. This is more than the amount received by George W. Bush in 2004, who received $36 million. Additionally, when looking at donations from the \"securities and investment\" category, President Obama received $17.3 million in 2008, which is more than the amount received by Republican Sen. John McCain in that cycle, who received $9.7 million, and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who received $7.5 million. Furthermore, when comparing the amounts raised by President Obama in his 2012 re-election campaign, it was revealed that Wall Street sent him $10 million less than in his previous campaign. These figures demonstrate that President Obama did break the record for Wall Street donations in 2008 and provide evidence to support the claim that he took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had.",
    "doc": "Just because you've taken money from Wall Street doesn't mean you can't regulate Wall Street.That was the message Hillary Clinton tried to promote during the March 6 debate with fellow Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in Flint, Mich. Sanders has attacked Clinton for accepting a lot of contributions from the financial industry, an industry both Sanders and Clinton say they want to tighten the screws on. Sanders arguedthat you can't do it when you've accepted as much money from Wall Street as Clinton has. Clinton countered Sunday night that the case of President Barack Obama shows you can. \"President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had,\" she said. \"And when it came time to stand up to Wall Street, he passed and signed the toughest regulations since the Great Depression, with the Dodd-Frank regulations.\" For this fact-check, we're looking at whether Obama set a record for campaign donations from Wall Street in 2008. Given the context, we're only looking at direct contributions made to candidates, not super PACs or other organizations that can accept unlimited contributions. Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin cited a 2012 analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that tracks campaign donations. It found that Obama received $44.3 million in 2008 from the \"finance, insurance and real estate\" sector. Four years earlier, George W. Bush had received $36million. Adjusted for inflation, Bush received $41.1 million in 2008 dollars, making Bush and Obama close, but still putting Obama ahead. But the \"finance, insurance and real estate\" sector includes industries that go beyond what people traditionally think of as Wall Street. The Center for Responsive Politics has told PolitiFact that the best way to determine what Wall Street is donating is to look at donations from the \"securities and investment\" category. By that measure, Obama received $17.3 million in 2008 (with Republican Sen. John McCain a distant second at $9.7 million and Clinton in that cycle at third, at $7.5 million). Four years earlier, George W. Bush received $10million, which is $11.4 million in 2008 dollars. So when it comes to Wall Street contributions, Obama broke the record in 2008. But Obama's support of financial reform may have cost him. When he ran for reelection in 2012, Wall Street sent him $10 million less. He received $7 million for that election cycle. It was Republican Mitt Romney who set the new record \u2014 $23.7 million, which would be $22.2 in 2008 dollars. And, for the record, in the current race, the most recent data supplied by the center's website, OpenSecrets.org, shows Clinton with $3.4 million from the securities and investment industry, Marco Rubio with $1.6 million, Ted Cruz with $754,583, John Kasich with $274,317 and Sanders with $108,761."

    "justification": "The label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim \"\"8.5 million Americans have gotten rebate checks because their insurance companies were spending too much money on executive bonuses and administrative costs and not enough on health care.\"\" The evidence provided supports this claim, as it states that in 2013, insurance companies returned $1.1 billion in rebates to 13.1 million policyholders, with an average rebate of $98 per person. This means that approximately 8.85 million people received rebates, which is close to the original estimate of 8.5 million provided by Axelrod.\n\nThe evidence also explains why the rebates were issued. The Affordable Care Act requires health insurance companies to spend at least 80% of their premiums on medical care, not administrative costs. If a company fails to meet this ratio, they must return the difference to their policyholders in the form of rebates. The evidence shows that in 2013, insurance companies returned $1.1 billion in rebates to 13.1 million policyholders, which is consistent with the claim made by Axelrod.\n\nWhile some critics have pointed out that not all policyholders received physical checks, the evidence shows that a significant portion of them did. Approximately one-third, or 2.9 million people, received rebates for coverage in the individual market in 2013. The rest of the rebates went to small and large employers who manage health insurance plans for their employees, with the rebate split proportionately between the employer and employee.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, the claim that \"8.5 million Americans have gotten rebate checks because their insurance companies were spending too much money on executive bonuses and administrative costs and not enough on health care\" is supported by the data. The label \"True\" is therefore appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "It\u2019s not an easy time to be a supporter of the health care law. There\u2019s rage at every turn, for the millions of policy cancellation notices in Americans\u2019 mailboxes, for the faulty online marketplace, and for President Barack Obama\u2019s leadership in general. David Axelrod, Obama\u2019s former campaign strategist and adviser, tried batting down the dearth of bad press with some positive statistics about the law Thursday on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. The law allows young adults under 26 to stay on their parents\u2019 plan, prohibits insurers from refusing coverage to children with pre-existing conditions, and eliminates lifetime caps, Axelrod said. Plus, \"8.5 million Americans have gotten rebate checks because their insurance companies were spending too much money on executive bonuses and administrative costs and not enough on health care.\" Shortly after his segment, Axelrod took to Twitter and said he was talking about rebates sent in 2013. We wanted to know if his point is accurate. You\u2019re probably wondering who got free money from their insurance companies, and why, because it likely wasn\u2019t you. One of the health care law\u2019s many requirements demands health insurance companies spend at least 80 percent of each dollar they charge in premiums on medical care, not for administrative purposes. Policy wonks know it as the medical loss ratio, or the 80/20 rule (for larger employers, it\u2019s more like the 85/15 rule, but that\u2019s more than we need to know for this fact-check). Some Americans know it as the way they got paid by their insurer. If a company spends less than 80 percent on medical services, it must return the difference to the consumer either as a cash payment or as a reduction in future payments. Two-thirds of insurance companies were already meeting the ratio without a policy change, according to a 2011 Government Accountability Office study, though compliance varied upon policy type. For example, 77 percent of companies that sold to large employers with more than 100 employees met the 80/20 rule, while only 43 percent of companies serving customers in the individual market were in compliance. The ratio does not apply to self-funded plans. Insurance companies had to report their premiums and spending for the first time in 2011. Companies returned $1.1 billion in total rebates to 13.1 million policyholders in 2012, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data. Companies returned about half as much in rebates in 2013 to 8.85 million policyholders (Axelrod was citing the agency\u2019s original estimate of 8.5 million recipients). The average rebate was $98. So Axelrod is on somewhat solid ground here. But there\u2019s a caveat. While 8.85 million policyholders were due rebates, it doesn\u2019t mean people are getting checks as Axelrod claimed. Our colleagues at PolitiFact pointed this out in a statement from Obama over the summer. (Obama also tried to put a dollar amount on the checks, which led to a rating of Half True.) About one-third, or 2.9 million people, received rebates for coverage in the individual market in 2013 (the proportion was about the same in 2012). That means they physically got a check. The rest of the rebates went to the small and large employers who manage health insurance plans for their employees. Employers and employees often share the cost of health insurance, with employers picking up the bulk of the cost. In those cases, the rebate goes to the employer because they buy the insurance. But the law requires that the rebate be split proportionately. Employers can pay their employees in a lump sum, reduce future premiums or act by \"applying the rebate in a manner that benefits its employees,\" such as shoring up the health fund or offering better benefits. Again, the rebates came but they doesn\u2019t mean it trickled down to policyholders in the form of a check."

    "doc": "ABC\u2019s This Week spent much of their show Sunday discussing race issues, from affirmative action to racist comments allegedly made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling to economic disparity. During a roundtable segment on the difference between the middle class in the United States and Canada, Fusion reporter Alicia Menendez argued that differences in wealth aren\u2019t just generational, they\u2019re racial. \"We also know that there is a racial component to this, that a white family is likely to have about six times as much wealth than a black or Hispanic family coming out of the recession,\" she said. PunditFact finds her ratio correct. Menendez pointed us to an April 2013 report from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan social policy think-tank. The institute measured mean wealth by race. Using 2010 data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, the Urban Institute looked at assets including cash savings, homes, retirement accounts and subtracted any debt. The Urban Institute concluded that, post-recession, for every $1 an average black or Hispanic person has in wealth, an average white person has $6. That\u2019s up from 1983, the farthest back the study goes, when the ratio was 5-to-1. Thomas Shapiro, a Brandeis University social policy professor who studies the wage gap, said the 6-to-1 ratio is correct, but represents the lower end of the wealth gap range researchers have come up with. At the higher end of the spectrum, Pew Research cited a 20-to-1 ratio in 2011. They took median wealth from the Census Bureau\u2019s Survey of Income and Program Participation 2009 data. So the data varies by survey used, year and measure of average (mean vs median). There\u2019s debate among economists and social scientists about which ratio is the most accurate. Darrick Hamilton, an urban policy professor at The New School, said the Census Bureau surveys more low-income families, while the Survey of Consumer Finances oversamples high-income families where minorities aren\u2019t as well represented. Overall, any ratio from 6-to-1 to 22-to-1 could be considered an accurate measure of the wealth gap, Shapiro told us."

    "doc": "A Brown University student leader offered a provocative historical comparison at the beginning of a Nov. 18, 2014, forum on the efficacy of taxing and regulating marijuana in Rhode Island. \"There are more African-American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850,\" said Diego Arene-Morley, president of Brown University Students for Sensible Drug Policy. Arene-Morley made the statement to highlight that African-American and Hispanic men are arrested at disproportionate rates under the current drug laws. We wondered whether Arene-Morley got his numbers right, so we asked him what he based his statement on. We also reached out to the Department of Justice\u2019s Bureau of Justice Statistics and the national nonprofit advocacy group, The Sentencing Project, for current figures. And we contacted the U.S. Census Bureau and the Rhode Island Historical Society for data about slavery in 1850. The Census of 1850 showed that 872,924 male African-American slaves over age 15 lived in the United States at that time. (The same Census found that there were a total of 3.2 million African-American slaves of all ages, at a time when the total U.S. population, including slaves and \"free coloreds,\" was 23.2 million.) How does that compare with the number of African-American men now under some sort of judicial system supervision? According to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were 526,000 African-American men serving time in state or federal correctional facilities in 2013. (That\u2019s 37 percent of the overall 1.5 million imprisoned men.) That represented almost 3 percent of the overall black male population in the United States, compared with .5 percent of white males, according to the bureau. There were 877,000 African-American men on probation in 2013, according to the bureau. And there were 280,000 African-American male parolees. (Probation is part of a criminal sentence that allows an offender to remain under supervision in the community instead of jail. Parole is the supervised release of an inmate from jail before his or her official release date.) In total, there were about 1.68 million African-American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013, 807,076 more than the number of African-American men who were enslaved in 1850. Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, provided a somewhat higher estimate for the number of African-American men now imprisoned or on probation and parole. His number, which includes those serving time in local jails, was about 1.88 million, more than 1 million above the 1850 figure. For the Rhode Island perspective, we asked the state Department of Corrections for its numbers. As of Oct. 10, there were 932 African-American men sentenced or awaiting trial in Rhode Island out of 3,108 male inmates overall. In addition, 4,285 African-American men were on probation; 87 on parole; and 4 are on lifetime supervision, according to spokeswoman Susan Lamkins. That totals 5,308, or 11 percent of the 48,542 black or African-American men in Rhode Island 18 years or older, according to the Census estimates as of July 1, 2013. When Arene-Morley got back to us, he referred us to the book \"The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness\" by Michelle Alexander and to an interview with Alexander featured on the Huffington Post website. The Huffington Post piece attributes to Alexander a statement the more black men are behind bars or under the watch of the criminal justice system than there were enslaved in 1850."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, the label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim that \"Half of all CEOs say that the shutdown and the threat of shutdown set back their plans to hire over the next six months.\" Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. The Business Roundtable survey cited in the article found that 50% of responding CEOs indicated that the ongoing disagreement in Washington over the 2014 budget and the debt ceiling is having a negative impact on their plans for hiring additional employees over the next six months. This is the exact figure mentioned by President Obama in his public address.\n2. The survey was conducted among a representative sample of CEOs from large companies, as determined by factors such as revenue, industry, and market capitalization. While the exact question wording was not disclosed to the author, the fact that the survey was conducted among a representative sample of CEOs lends credibility to the findings.\n3. Other business groups, such as the National Federation of Independent Businesses, have also reported similar sentiments among their members. This suggests that the impact of the shutdown on hiring plans is not limited to any one industry or group of businesses, but rather is a broader trend.\n4. The article cites experts in the field who explain why CEOs might be hesitant to hire during this time, including concerns about tighter fiscal policy and consumer behavior. These factors could contribute to a delay in hiring plans, as CEOs may be hesitant to make decisions in an uncertain economic environment.\n\nOverall, the evidence provided in the article supports the claim that half of all CEOs have set back their hiring plans over the next six months due to the shutdown and threat of default. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate.",
    "doc": "After a Senate deal brought the 16-day government shutdown to a close, President Barack Obama wanted to make sure the impact of narrowly avoiding a default wasn\u2019t lost on the nation. \"These last few weeks have inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy,\" he said in a public address Thursday. As proof, he offered up specific claims including, \"Half of all CEOs say that the shutdown and the threat of shutdown set back their plans to hire over the next six months.\" PolitiFact wanted to know whether Obama\u2019s CEO statistic was accurate. The White House pointed us to a recent Business Roundtable survey. \"Fifty percent of responding CEOs indicated that the ongoing disagreement in Washington over the 2014 budget and the debt ceiling is having a negative impact on their plans for hiring additional employees over the next six months,\" the report reads. On its face, that\u2019s in line with what Obama said, but we wanted to see how Business Roundtable acquired their results. They would not disclose their exact question wording to us. Their report notes, \"Responses were received from 134 member CEOs, 63 percent of the total Business Roundtable membership.\" Business Roundtable\u2019s membership tends to be larger companies. Spokeswoman Amanda DeBard told us CEOs are invited based on revenue, industry and market capitalization, so it\u2019s safe to say the poll responses don\u2019t reflect a random sample of U.S. businesses. Since Obama often speaks to the Business Roundtable, we wanted to see what his relationship with the group was like. University of Kansas political science professor Burdett Loomis, who specializes in lobbying, said there\u2019s not much of a connection. \"Many of them have long-term relationships with government (simply because of their size and the government\u2019s size), but probably only a handful have any kind of even semi-close relationship with Obama,\" he said. We ran the poll results by another business group, the National Federation of Independent Businesses. Senior policy analyst Holly Wade said she saw a similar sentiment among the smaller business owners that the federation represents. \"In September, there were more small business owners that were feeling pessimistic about business conditions six months out,\" she said. There wasn\u2019t much opinion voiced about delaying employment specifically, though. But Wade said that could be because small businesses were already hiring less during the economic recovery compared to bigger corporations. Why would CEOs want to delay hiring? With another possible debt ceiling default looming Feb. 7, University of Maryland finance professor David Kass said it\u2019s likely that a budget deal will lead to tighter fiscal policy, which would slow down the economy and cause CEOs to put off hiring decisions for a few months. Another factor that would contribute to CEO anxiety is consumer behavior. While day-to-day spending probably won\u2019t change post-shutdown, consumers will likely postpone higher ticket purchases, like homes and cars. \"On the demand side, there\u2019s uncertainty on the consumers\u2019 part, which in turn will have an impact on CEOs,\" Kass said. \"They\u2019re trying to predict their future sales and what the environment will look like. It\u2019s a lose-lose situation for everyone.\" In any case, Obama is trying to communicate that the shutdown had a significant financial impact on the nation, and he\u2019s not wrong there. Independent forecasts agree that the shutdown was a setback for the U.S. economy, though they differ on exact figures."

    "claim": "\"My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid \u2014 costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",

    "justification": "Based on the provided evidence, it can be argued that Senator Rick Gunn's blocking of Medicaid expansion has resulted in half a million people losing health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans. The evidence cited includes reports from left-leaning organizations such as the North Carolina Justice Center and Close the Gap NC, as well as articles from the North Carolina Medical Journal, which estimate that Medicaid expansion would provide coverage to 500,000 people in North Carolina. Additionally, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that there are over 440,000 North Carolinians who are uninsured and earning less than 138% of the federal poverty level.\n\nThe evidence also suggests that a significant number of veterans would benefit from Medicaid expansion, with an estimate of approximately 23,000 North Carolina veterans receiving coverage under an expanded program. While the exact number may be outdated according to one expert, it is clear that a large number of people are impacted by Senator Gunn's opposition to Medicaid expansion. Therefore, based on the provided evidence, it can be argued that Senator Gunn's blocking of Medicaid expansion has resulted in half a million people losing health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans. The label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "For years, Democrats in North Carolina have pushed to expand Medicaid, a move they say would help hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians afford health insurance. JD Wooten, A Democratic candidate for state Senate, added new fuel to the expansion debate when he blasted his opponent, four-term Republican incumbent Sen. Rick Gunn, in a campaign ad. \"My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid \u2014 costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans,\" Wooten said in a caption posted with the video. We wondered if Wooten -- who is running in North Carolina\u2019s District 24, which includes Alamance County and part of Guilford County -- was correct in his estimates. We decided to take a look. \u2018Blocked the expansion\u2019 Medicaid provides health insurance to low-income people. North Carolina has participated in the program since 1970 but remains one of 17 states that has not moved to expand it. Medicaid expansion \u2014 an action made possible by the federal Affordable Care Act \u2014 would give coverage to folks with household incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. As a result, many North Carolinians who do not qualify for the ACA\u2019s health care subsidies or regular Medicaid coverage would be able to escape the so-called coverage gap. Since his election in 2016, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has battled with conservatives in the state\u2019s Republican-led legislature over the issue. There were signs of a bipartisan agreement when Republicans authored a 2017 bill called \"Carolina Cares,\" but the legislation never got off the ground in committee. But while some state Republicans have worked toward compromise, Gunn was among many co-sponsors of a 2013 bill that rejected the ACA\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion, clarified the state\u2019s intent not to operate a state-run health benefit exchange and determined that Medicaid eligibility decisions would be made by the state rather than the federal government. The bill was adopted by a vote of 74 to 40 in the state House and 31-16 in the state Senate and signed into law by then-Gov. Pat McCrory. Gunn did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but Republican leaders in the legislature have consistently opposed Medicaid expansion, saying North Carolina's share of the rising cost of the program would be too expensive. Senate leader Phil Berger called it a \"budget-busting\" expense, The News & Observer reported in 2017. \u2018Half a million people\u2019 The Wooten campaign cited several reports to support the claim that withholding Medicaid expansion was costing half a million North Carolinians health insurance. Among those were articles from the left-leaning North Carolina Justice Center, the pro-expansion Close the Gap NC and the North Carolina Medical Journal, all of which estimated that the expanded benefit would give new coverage to some 500,000 people. Most other reports predicted similar results. The U.S. Census Bureau, for example, estimated in 2016 that there are more than 440,000 North Carolinians who are uninsured and earning less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level. David Anderson, a research associate at Duke University\u2019s Margolis Center for Health Policy, said the actual impact would likely exceed the Census Bureau\u2019s estimate because additional people who are currently insured on ACA exchanges could be expected to transfer to Medicaid if an expansion bill passed. \"The estimate of 500,000 North Carolina residents would be covered by Medicaid is a solid estimate well within consensus, expert opinion,\" Anderson said. Other experts we consulted agreed. \"It appears that about a half a million people is close in the estimate,\" said Lisa Dubay, senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning, Washington-based think tank. Predictions and estimates vary, but Wooten\u2019s claim does not seem to oversell the impact Medicaid expansion could have. In a 2017 article, North Carolina Health News reported that the number could even exceed 625,000, according to the state\u2019s Medical Care Advising Committee, a collection of health clinic managers, doctors and administrators. Veterans affected The Wooten campaign did not say how or where it found its estimate for the impact on veterans, but the number may have come from NC Policy Watch, the news arm of the NC Justice Center, which cited a 2013 study from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute. According to that study, approximately 23,000 North Carolina veterans would receive Medicaid coverage under an expanded program. Anderson noted, however, that although the estimate resulted from a sound statistical process, it is becoming outdated. Jennifer Haley, a research associate in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute who co-authored the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study, also directed us to a more recent report issued by the Urban Institute in 2016. That report estimated that, of the 25,000 veterans projected to be uninsured in North Carolina in 2017, 2,000 would be eligible for but not receiving Medicaid and another 12,000 would fall into the coverage gap, for a total of approximately 14,000 people. This number is short of Wooten\u2019s 23,000, but Anderson explained that the difference between the two studies\u2019 findings is likely due to sampling error and trend changes. \"The caveat with Medicaid expansion is that current veterans who make between 100 and 138 percent (of the federal poverty level) would be able to switch their insurance to Medicaid or gain coverage,\" Anderson said. \"There are no good numbers for that. I think it is safe to say that the most recent study gives a floor of 14,000.\" So Wooten\u2019s estimate may be outdated, but it does not seem unreasonable. And his larger point \u2014 that a large number of veterans would gain coverage from Medicaid expansion \u2014 holds true."

    "claim": "\"We\u2019re above 800 million Muslims radicalized, more than half the Muslims on Earth That\u2019s not a minority. That\u2019s now a majority.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "Based solely on the evidence provided in the article, it is difficult to accurately determine the number of radicalized Muslims worldwide. The evidence presented suggests that there is significant variation in how different countries and sects interpret and support Sharia law, which complicates efforts to reach a definitive conclusion about the number of radicalized Muslims.\n\nBen Shapiro's argument that there are over 800 million radicalized Muslims, which he arrived at by extrapolating from polling data on support for Sharia law, is questionable for several reasons. Firstly, Shapiro consistently uses the highest percentages available in the surveys to maximize the number of Muslims he can tag with the \"radical\" label (para 3). This methodology is flawed because it does not account for the fact that different branches of Islam use different versions of the law, and that support for Sharia law varies widely among countries and sects.\n\nSecondly, Shapiro's definition of radicalism is overly broad, as he considers any support for Sharia law to be a marker of radicalism (para 4). However, as James Bell, director of International Survey Research at Pew, notes, many Muslims will say they want religious judges deciding family or property disputes, but may not support corporal punishments for criminals or the death penalty for apostates (para 5). This suggests that there is a degree of nominal faithfulness among Muslims when it comes to their views on Sharia law.\n\nFinally, the article presents alternative measures of radicalism that could lead to a distinct minority rather than a majority of radicalized Muslims (para 6-7). For example, using the percentage of Muslims who support suicide bombings against civilian targets as an alternate measure of radicalism, the total number of radicalized Muslims could be significantly lower than Shapiro's claim.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence presented in the article, it is difficult to accurately determine the number of radicalized Muslims worldwide. While Shapiro's argument that there are over 800 million radicalized Muslims may seem persuasive at first glance, it is flawed by its reliance on high percentages and an overly broad definition of radicalism. A more nuanced approach to measuring radicalization among Muslims would take into account the varying interpretations and support for Sharia law across different countries and sects.",
    "doc": "The rise of the Islamic State group and its strategic use of grisly beheadings has stirred a heated debate in this country about the nature of Islam. Some critics say core Muslim beliefs invite violence. Defenders of religious tolerance say extremists represent only a tiny minority of Muslims. Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro jumped in to say the nature of Islam is irrelevant. More important, according to Shapiro, is what its followers believe, \"because that\u2019s what they act upon.\" Through this lens, Shapiro painted a disturbing picture of the religious wellspring for people who fly planes into towers and behead their prisoners. Shapiro is an editor-at-large with the conservative website Breitbart.com and cofounded a conservative media analysis group, TruthRevolt. In a video, Shapiro blended survey data and population statistics for 15 countries. A good example of his thesis about Islam is in the way he talked about Indonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim nation. \"It\u2019s got almost 205 million Muslims,\" Shapiro said. \"According to one 2009 poll, it showed almost 50 percent of Indonesians support strict Sharia law, not just in Indonesia but in a lot of countries. And 70 percent blame the United States, Israel or somebody else for 9/11. You make that calculation, it\u2019s about 143 million people who are radicalized. You scared yet? We\u2019re just getting started.\" To get to 143 million \"radicalized\" Muslims, Shapiro took the 70 percent of Indonesia\u2019s Muslims who blamed someone other than al-Qaida for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Shapiro then made similar extrapolations using polling data for a number of other countries, often measuring support for Sharia law -- codes of behavior in Islam. Then Shapiro summed up and applied the percentage of \"radicalized Muslims\" from the 15 nations to a number of other Muslim-majority countries and, with 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide, reached a shocking conclusion. \"We\u2019re above 800 million Muslims radicalized, more than half the Muslims on Earth,\" Shapiro said. \"That\u2019s not a minority. That\u2019s now a majority.\" Shapiro spoke with great self-assurance, but as we looked at his claim that most Muslims are radicals, we were left scratching our heads. In the first place, Shapiro consistently used the highest percentages available in the surveys to maximize the number of Muslims he could tag with the \"radical\" label. Secondly, he used a broad definition of radical. To choose one main example, there are many varieties of how people interpret Sharia law and support for it says little about a person\u2019s specific beliefs. Other numbers tell a different story Shapiro cited the work of the Pew Research Center in some of his analysis and much of our work relies on the same source. We tried to reach Shapiro and were unsuccessful. In about half of the countries he assessed, Shapiro focused on support for Sharia law. According tothe Council on Foreign Relations, \"Sharia guides all aspects of Muslim life, including daily routines, familial and religious obligations, and financial dealings.\" It is a moral code that covers marriage, crime and business. Different branches of Islam use different versions of the law. Some elements are widely accepted, such as the immorality of fraud. But for countries and sects that follow the harshest versions in which thieves have their hands cut off and unfaithful women are stoned to death, the opposition from the West, and parts of the Muslim world as well, is strong and visceral. For Shapiro, support for any form of Sharia law means one thing -- the believer is a radical. Accordingly, Shapiro looks at a place like Pakistan and says that 76 percent of Muslims want Sharia law in all Muslim countries. Pakistan has 179 million Muslims, therefore, \"that is another 135.4 million radicals.\" But looking at a 2013 Pew report on Muslims, we found that the picture is more complicated. Pew reported that 84 percent of Pakistani Muslims wanted Sharia law, but of those, nearly two-thirds said it should only apply to Muslims. Run those numbers through and you get about 54 million Muslims who think all Pakistanis should be subject to Sharia law. That\u2019s about 60 percent fewer than Shapiro said. We are not saying that Pakistan has 54 million radical Muslims. Our point is that more detailed polling data changes the results a great deal. Shapiro chose one yardstick. Other analysts could with at least as much justification choose another. The impact of which question is used becomes even clearer if we look at support for suicide bombings against civilian targets. Shapiro said actual terrorists draw \"moral, financial and religious support from those who are not terrorists themselves.\" Even if you believe Shapiro, it doesn\u2019t mean that attitudes towards terrorism are irrelevant. Pew asked Muslims if they supported suicide bombings against civilians. In Pakistan, 13 percent of Muslims said such attacks in defense of Islam could often or sometimes be justified. If that\u2019s your definition of radicals, then Pakistan has about 23 million of them. Hardly a small number, but it\u2019s a far cry from the 135 million Shapiro counted. The following table shows how using reasonable alternative measures of radicalism, Shapiro\u2019s majority can become a distinct minority. You can see how Shapiro reached his totals by watching the video. Country Population (millions) Radical total (Shapiro, millions) Alternative pct. Alternative total (millions) Indonesia 205 143 Pew: 7% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 14.4 Egypt 80 55.2 Pew: 29% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 23.2 Pakistan 179 135.4 Pew: 13% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 23.3 Bangladesh 149 121.9 Pew: 26% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 38.7 Nigeria 75.7 53.7 Pew: 22% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 16.7 Iran 74.8 62.1 ICP/Charney: 47% would abolish the morality police. 35.2 Turkey 74.7 23.9 Pew: 15% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 11.2 Morocco 32.4 24.6 Pew: 9% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 2.9 Iraq 31.1 24.3 Pew: 7% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 2.2 Afghanistan 24 24 Pew: 39% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 9.4 Jordan 6.4 3.8 Pew: 15% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 1 Palestinian areas 4.3 3.83 Pew: 40% say suicide bombing can sometimes be justified. 1.7 France 4.7 1.6 No alternate used 1.6 Great Britain 2.8 2.2 Manchester Policy: 2% expressed some support for terrorism. 0.06 United States 2.6 0.5 Pew: In 2009, 8% said suicide bombings could sometimes be justified. 0.2 Total 946.5 680.03 181.76 Percent of total 72% 19% To be clear, we\u2019re not saying there are 181 million radical Muslims. We\u2019re simply saying by applying different but reasonable criteria to the same data, you can reach a vastly different result. Sharia \u2260 radical Given that Shapiro used support for Sharia law in 7 of the 15 countries as a marker for radicalism, we should note that the experts we reached urged a more cautious approach. Pew found that when you ask Muslims about specific elements in Sharia law, support shifts. According to James Bell, director of International Survey Research at Pew, many Muslims will say they want religious judges deciding family or property disputes. But ask them about corporal punishments for criminals or the death penalty for apostates, and support drops off considerably. \"The key takeaway is that Muslims differ in what they mean by Sharia and how they want it applied,\" Bell said. Jim Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, a political and policy advocacy group for Arab Americans, said most Muslims don\u2019t think about every element of sharia. \"It indicates a degree of nominal faithfulness,\" Zogby said. If I say I support the law in the abstract, it doesn\u2019t commit me to supporting various and assorted aspects.\" In two countries, Shapiro focused onsupport for honor killings. Zogby said that as cruel as honor killings are, they are not tied to beliefs that underlie beheadings and suicide bombings. \"One has nothing to do with the other,\" Zogby said. Maria Sobolewska, a lecturer in quantitative methods and politics at the University of Manchester, England, studied polls in that country in the wake of the 2005 bus and subway bombings. Sobolewska found enormous variation in Muslim responses depending on small changes in the wording of questions. \"What we receive as a true picture of what Muslims think is mostly an artifact of what they get asked,\" Sobolewska wrote. We should note that we found no solid estimate of the number of radical Muslims worldwide. For example, a 2014 report on jihadist terrorism from the Bipartisan Policy Center did not quantify the size of the jihadist population."

    "doc": "Heads up: Another Bush is raising his profile.As noted in a March 3, 2012, Texas Tribune news article, attorney George P. Bush, the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and nephew of former President George W. Bush, has been pitching afresh for a group he helped found, the Hispanic Republicans of Texas.\"Politics is in my blood,\" the Tribune story quotes Bush as saying in a story about the group's political action committee.But Rebecca Acu\u00f1a, spokeswoman for the Texas Democratic Party, sounded skeptical of the PAC\u2019s chances of helping Republican Hispanics advance. Acu\u00f1a told the Tribune: \"They are delusional if they think they\u2019re making any inroads with Latinos. In Texas, there are 668 Democratic Hispanic elected officials to the 60 in the Republican Party.\"Do Hispanic Democratic elected officials so greatly outnumber their Latino Republican counterparts in Texas?Looked entirely like it -- at first.To our inquiry, Acu\u00f1a sent us portions of a 2011 directory of Latino elected officials compiled by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, which describes itself as the nonpartisan leadership organization of the nation's more than 6,000 Latino elected and appointed officials.The chart provided by Acu\u00f1a says that of 2,520 Hispanic elected officials in Texas in January 2011, 668 were Democrats and 60 were Republicans, matching the figures aired to the Tribune. Two school board members were counted as Independents.According to the chart, 496 elected Latino officials in Texas held nonpartisan offices, mainly serving in municipal government or on school boards, and another 1,294 Latino elected officials, also mostly serving on school boards or in municipal offices, were listed as \"no party stated.\"And how does NALEO gather all this?A methodology section of the 2011 directory says the NALEO Educational Fund has regularly attempted to tabulate Latino elected officials since 1984. For the 2011 check, NALEO staff contacted each identified official by phone or fax to ask whether they were indeed Latino, the group says.\"The phone verification process proved invaluable,\" the methodology section says. \"Many individuals having Spanish surnames were in fact, not Latino. Conversely, other individuals with non-Spanish surnames were identified as being Latino.\"Rosalind Gold, a senior director for the NALEO Educational Fund, told us in a telephone interview that how officeholders self-identify has proved pivotal. \"We very much rely on self-identification in determining who is and who is not Latino,\" Gold said.By email, Martha Recio, a NALEO research assistant, confirmed the figures cited for 2011.At our request, NALEO also composed a chart showing its identified party breakdowns for Texas Latino elected officials for 2001 through 2011.The group\u2019s determinations of party affiliations have been incomplete because, Gold told us, so many local offices are filled in non-partisan elections; such candidates do not run as party nominees. In each of the years, at least 68 percent of the Latino elected officials tabulated by NALEO were not identified by party affiliation.Also, Gold said, if the group could not verify an officeholder\u2019s party membership by telephoning their office, it did not attempt to do so by tapping other sources. NALEO doesn\u2019t have resources to do that, she said. Sometimes, too, Gold said, an officeholder declined to discuss his or her party membership.We asked Gold if it\u2019s fair to make comparisons limited to its counts of Republican and Democratic Latino elected officials when most of the group\u2019s identified Latino elected officials are not identified by party. Gold replied that this is the kind of context NALEO provides when discussing its counts. \"We say that of the elected officials we were able to verify affiliation for, here is the party breakdown,\" she said.Back to the Texas counts: Among officeholders tabulated as Democrats or Republicans, the share of Democratic elected officeholders dropped from 32 percent in 2001 to 20 percent in 2010 before reaching nearly 27 percent in 2011. The relative share of Latino Republican officeholders was .7 percent in 2001, escalating to .9 percent in 2010 and 2.4 percent in 2011, according to the group.With so many party affiliations not nailed down, we wouldn\u2019t blame anyone for ruling out comparisons of results for different years. That misgiving aside, though, it looks like the ratio of elected Hispanic Democrats to Republican Latinos in Texas has narrowed. The NALEO counts suggest there were nearly 45 Hispanic Texas Democrats per Republican counterpart in 2001, 34 in 2005 and 11 in 2011."

    "justification": "The claim that Hillary Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital and was seen wearing glasses only for people with traumatic brain injury is false. The evidence provided shows that Clinton was in the hospital for about four days in December 2012, not 30 days, and that the glasses she wore were related to issues stemming from her concussion.\n\nSteven Galetta, chair of the Neurology Department at New York University Medical Center, explained that about 30 to 50 percent of concussions lead to some kind of visual problem, including double vision, which can be managed with prismatic glasses. The glasses are designed to help with blurred or double vision and are often optional, depending on how quickly the person wants to get back to work. Galetta said that most patients resolve the issues on their own, but that some may need optional treatment like prismatic glasses.\n\nDoug Smith, professor of neurosurgery and director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania, also noted that a concussion is technically a mild traumatic brain injury, but that Rove's characterization of Clinton's concussion as a traumatic brain injury generated concern among physicians. Smith explained that the public may not understand how broadly the term applies, as the Centers for Disease Control report that 2.2 million head injuries sent people to the emergency room in 2010.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that Karl Rove's claim about Hillary Clinton's hospital stay and glasses is false. The time she spent in the hospital was not 30 days, and the glasses she wore were related to her concussion, not a traumatic brain injury. Therefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate.",
    "doc": "If Hillary Clinton decides to run for president, she knows every bit of her life will be put under a microscope. Republican strategist and Fox News commentator Karl Rove proved the point at an event near Los Angeles last Thursday. In remarks reported in the New York Post, Rove raised questions about Clinton\u2019s health following a mild concussion in 2012. \"Thirty days in the hospital,\" Rove said. \"And when she reappears, she's wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what's up with that.\" Many people took Rove\u2019s comments to mean that he thinks Clinton has a brain injury, though Rove says he was just raising the question and that it should be part of any presidential vetting. There are two points for us to cover in this fact check -- the time Clinton spent in the hospital and the nature of the glasses she wore for weeks afterward. (She doesn\u2019t wear them now.) First, the background. In December 2012, a stomach virus kept Clinton at home where she fainted and hit her head. During a follow-up visit, doctors spotted a blood clot, admitted her to the hospital and treated her with blood thinners. Clinton was in the hospital for about four days, not 30, a point Rove got wrong. (In a subsequent interview, Rove said it was a \"30-day period where she\u2019s fighting something.\") Clinton testified near the end of January at a House hearing on the Benghazi, Libya, attack, and was seen wearing the glasses Rove referred to. A State Department spokesman said they were related to issues stemming from her concussion. The peculiar shape of one of the lenses led experts and doctors to conclude they were prismatic glasses. The glasses are designed to help with blurred or double vision, experts told us. We spoke with Steven Galetta, who is chair of the Neurology Department at New York University Medical Center. \"About 30 to 50 percent of concussions lead to some kind of visual problem,\" Galetta said. \"When there\u2019s double vision, we can manage it by putting a prism over one eye. It bends the light to line up the image from the other eye.\" Galetta said the glasses are often optional. Whether someone wears them depends on how quickly the person wants to get back to work. \"Most patients resolve (the issues) on their own,\" he said. \"I\u2019d say 85 to 90 percent of these patients do incredibly well and have no recognizable symptoms afterwards.\" Given Clinton\u2019s job as Secretary of State, Galetta said he could see why her doctors might have jumped in to deal with her complaint. Rove exagerated the tie between the glasses and trauma. Galetta said such lenses are used in cases other than traumatic brain injury. Anything that affects the ocular motor nerves or the way the eyes worktogether can produce double vision that then might be treated with prismatic glasses. So while Rove said the glasses are used \"only\" for people with traumatic brain injury, doctors say that is incorrect. More broadly, Rove\u2019s characterization of Clinton\u2019s concussion as a traumatic brain injury generated a bit of concern among the physicians we reached. Doug Smith is a professor of neurosurgery and director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania. Smith said the public might not understand how broadly the term applies. The Centers for Disease Control report that 2.2 million head injuries sent people to the emergency room in 2010. \"Technically, a concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury,\" Smith said. \"But Rove made a linkage that doesn\u2019t fit. Having a concussion and wearing those glasses tell you nothing about a person\u2019s cognitive status. The vast majority of people with concussions make a full recovery.\""

    "claim": "\"We have an Army that just cut 40,000 spots.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The claim that \"We have an Army that just cut 40,000 spots\" is true based on the evidence provided. The article from PolitiFact states that the Army plans to cut 40,000 soldiers by fiscal year 2018, which is the same number cited by Senator Marco Rubio in his statement. While some experts have questioned the need for these cuts and whether they will be fully implemented, the evidence supports the label of \"True\" for this claim.\n\nThe article provides several sources to back up this claim, including an Army announcement and statements from military officials. The Army has been scaling back its force in recent years, with plans to reduce the size of the regular Army from 490,000 to 450,000 by fiscal year 2018. While some experts have expressed concerns about the cuts, the evidence indicates that the number of soldiers in the Army will indeed be reduced by 40,000 over the next few years.\n\nIt is worth noting that the label of \"True\" does not necessarily imply that these cuts are desirable or necessary, but rather that they are currently planned and underway. The issue of military spending and force size is a complex one, and there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate. However, based solely on the evidence provided, the label of \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said at the Iowa State Fair that to face threats from across the globe, ranging from the Middle East to Asia to Russia, the United States needs to keep its military strong. \"The most important obligation of the federal government is to keep you safe and me safe and our family safe,\" Rubio said on Aug. 18, 2015. \"And it\u2019s not doing that now, because we are eviscerating our defense spending.\" One example he cited: \"We have an Army that just cut 40,000 spots.\" We were curious if that number was correct, so we decided to check it out. Army announcement Army officials had been talking about reducing the size of their force for several months when they announced specific plans in July 2015. The Army said it will cut the size of the regular Army from 490,000 to 450,000 by fiscal year 2018 -- that\u2019s 40,000 -- with some of the largest cuts at sites in Georgia and Texas. Those cuts will start in October 2015 and end by October 2018. That means the cuts to the Army haven\u2019t happened yet and will be finished under the next president. The cuts are expected to come through attrition, early retirements and layoffs. That\u2019s in addition to plans to cut 17,000 civilians. The Army has been substantially scaling back its force the past few years. In 2012, the Army had about 570,000 soldiers. In 2013, the Army announced a drawdown of 80,000 to bring the size to the current 490,000. The new cuts will save about $7 billion. Army officials said the cuts are a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the budget sequestration that followed. If sequestration continues, the Army expects to shrink to about 420,000 soldiers sometime in 2019. \"We think 450,000 is the minimum force to meet our obligations across the globe,\" Army spokesman Lt. Cmd. Joe Buccino told PolitiFact. Some lawmakers have questioned the cuts in light of the current situation with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, among other crises. In an op-ed in the Washington Post in May, Rubio was critical of Obama\u2019s actions in Iraq and Syria. He called for the president to\"increase the number of U.S. forces in Iraq.\" Rubio correctly cited the number that the Army plans to cut, but he omitted some caveats, including that the cuts haven\u2019t taken place yet. And it\u2019s difficult to predict if the cuts will be fully implemented as the end date in 2018 will be under a new president and Congress. \"The reduction in active Army end-strength is likely but far from certain, given that lots of people in the Congress would like to get the Army more money,\" said Benjamin Friedman, a military expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said she expects the cuts to occur. \"The Army waited as long as possible to even start this latest reduction in force size,\" she said. While the talking about the reduction in soldiers makes good political fodder, it doesn\u2019t address whether higher troop counts are needed, said Charles Knight, co-founder of Project on Defense Alternatives, a group that advocates for lower levels of armed force and military spending worldwide. \"The only circumstance in which the Army needs those soldiers is if the U.S. were to reoccupy Iraq, invade and occupy Syria or Iran, or such,\" he said. \"Current government policy is explicitly against such options.\" But the next president -- whether it\u2019s Rubio or someone else -- \"could easily reverse current policy starting in 2017,\" Knight said. A few experts took issue with Rubio\u2019s statement that we are \"eviscerating\" defense spending. \"The term eviscerate is, to my mind, entirely unwarranted for a military that continues to spend almost $600 billion a year, well above the Cold War average and nearly 40 percent of the world\u2019s total,\" said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a defense expert at the Brookings Institution."

    "claim": "Says President Barack Obama \"spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that President Barack Obama \"spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs\" is False. The evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim in several ways:\n\n1. Not all of the stimulus money went to paying government employees. Only a modest (though uncertain) fraction did, with more than two-thirds of the total going towards tax benefits and entitlement payments for individuals and businesses.\n2. The third category of spending, worth $261.2 billion, included funding for some government jobs, such as teachers, but a sizable chunk of this money was used by the government to fund work carried out by the private sector, such as road-building companies and hazardous-waste cleanup contractors.\n3. The article notes that neither the federal government nor government as a whole has seen a surge in employment, with the size of the federal workforce declining by 69,000 since Obama took office, and government employment plunging by 734,000 jobs. This suggests that the stimulus did not lead to an increase in \"make-work\" government jobs.\n4. The term \"make-work\" is problematic because it implies that the work performed by government employees is unnecessary or useless. However, many of the projects funded by the stimulus, such as education and infrastructure, are important priorities for society and contribute to economic growth in a meaningful way.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the claim that President Obama \"spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs\" is False. The evidence provided in the article does not support this claim, and instead suggests that the stimulus was used to fund important priorities and did not result in a significant increase in \"make-work\" government jobs.",
    "doc": "Even though the stimulus enacted by President Barack Obama in 2009 has been phased out for a few years now, it remains a talking point for some Republican critics. During his response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union address, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took a shot at the stimulus when he said this: \"Mr. President,\" Paul said, \"where are the jobs? You spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs and still joblessness confronts the next generation.\" We wondered whether Paul -- a potential 2016 presidential candidate -- was correct to say that Obama \"spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs.\" First, some background on the stimulus, which was passed in 2009 with almost exclusive Democratic backing. When it was passed, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expected more than 90 percent of the cost to occur within fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011. It has found that those expenditures have proceeded more or less on schedule. So far, the stimulus has spent $816 billion. One could characterize that as \"nearly a trillion dollars,\" especially when you add in the debt incurred in order to make that spending possible. The estimate for the debt required to support the stimulus was $347 billion over 10 years, making the combination of the stimulus and the added debt a bit under $1.2 trillion. What\u2019s more problematic about Paul\u2019s claim is his charge that this money went toward \"make-work government jobs.\" This claim is dubious on two levels. First, not all the stimulus money went to paying government employees -- only a modest (though uncertain) fraction did. The stimulus included three broad categories of spending, broken down below with the amount spent so far: \u2022 Tax benefits to individuals and businesses: $290.7 billion \u2022 Entitlements, including Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment benefits: $264.4 billion \u2022 Contracts, grants and loans in such areas as education, transportation, infrastructure, energy, science and health: $261.2 billion So right off the bat, more than two-thirds of the total -- tax benefits and entitlement payments -- cannot be fairly categorized as funding \"make-work government jobs.\" These were payments and tax givebacks for individuals and businesses to spend as they saw fit. The third category, worth $261.2 billion, did include funding for some government jobs, such as teachers, but a sizable chunk of this money was used by the government to fund work carried out by the private sector, such as road-building companies and hazardous-waste cleanup contractors. It\u2019s also worth noting that neither the federal government nor government as a whole has seen a surge in employment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statsitics, the size of the federal workforce has declined by 69,000 since Obama took office, though it has risen by about 65,000 if cuts in the Postal Service workforce are not included. That\u2019s about a 3 percent increase over a five-year period if you use the figures that exclude the Postal Service. The drop is even more clear in government jobs at all levels -- federal, state and local. Since Obama took office, government employment has plunged by 734,000 jobs, which is a decrease about 10 times bigger than the federal increase. Which brings us to the second concern: Not all of these government employees were engaged in \"make work.\" Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary defines \"make work\" as \"a job, project or assignment that serves no useful purpose other than to give an otherwise idle or unemployed person something to do.\" The classic example is of paying an unemployed person to dig a hole, then to fill it up again. Whether something qualifies a \"make work\" is open to debate; critics of all ideological stripes can surely find examples of specific projects in the stimulus that they would consider unworthy of taxpayer support. Still, the biggest category of \"contracts, grants and loans\" -- accounting for more than one-third of this heading -- is education, and a big chunk of those funds, about $51 billion, went toward keeping previously employed educators from being laid off. Another $16 billion went to student financial aid, plus a combined $24 billion for educating disadvantaged and special-needs children. Since much of this funding went toward teachers who were already employed, and were in danger of being laid off, it seems hard to characterize their duties as \"make work.\" When we checked with Paul\u2019s office, aides offered a revised phrase to replace \"make-work government jobs\" -- namely, \"government-facilitated job growth.\" This terminology would be more accurate; indeed, we\u2019d expect to find little disagreement with this from Democrats who supported the stimulus. The stimulus was the keystone of Obama\u2019s efforts to stop the nation\u2019s economic freefall, while also accomplishing some other priorities in such areas as infrastructure and scientific research. Democrats tend to believe that government spending -- called \"Keynesian\" after its progenitor, the late economist John Maynard Keynes -- plays a major role in economic downturns in replacing vanished or reduced spending by the private sector. Some Republicans are skeptical of this approach, suggesting that tax cuts get more money into the hands of private individuals who can lead an economic recovery more effectively than the government can. We won\u2019t referee that debate. Instead, we\u2019ll note that we would have agreed there\u2019s a good argument that Obama engaged in roughly $1 billion of \"government-facilitated job growth.\" That, of course, begs the question of whether the payoff in job creation was worth the $1 trillion spent. Employment is up by 3.2 million since Obama was sworn in, but it remains almost 1.2 million below its peak, almost five years into the recovery."

An April 9 Wall Street Journal article about state plans to possibly ration ventilators as health care facilities were overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients reported that AARP called for federal policies to protect the elderly and other vulnerable groups from rationing. The Washington Post reported that AARP \"decried age cutoffs for ventilator access in some plans.\" On April 24, AARP sent a letter to the director of the civil rights office at the Department of Health and Human Services. \"It is imperative that those entrusted with deciding who gets access to healthcare do not discriminate,\" the letter said. \"Using age or disability status to categorically exclude people from accessing treatment violates existing federal law and we join you in strongly opposing such discrimination.\" Biden, who was elected president at age 77, did form a coronavirus advisory board that includes Dr. Atul Gawande, a senior adviser in Health and Human Services during the Clinton administration, Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who was an adviser to the agency\u2019s secretary and Ezekiel Emanuel, an Obama administration health policy advisor who in 2014 wrote an essay about reducing medical interventions by choice in old age.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the truth is that Trump has battled charges of racism almost as long as he has been in the public eye \u2014 and long before he stepped into politics. A January 2018 opinion article in the New York Times calls Trump a racist. \"He talks about and treats people differently based on their race,\" the story says. \"He has done so for years, and he is still doing so.\" The piece compiles quotes from Trump from before he ran for president as a Republican in the 2016 election and cites incidents such as when, in the 1970s, Trump\u2019s real estate company \"tried to avoid renting apartments to African-Americans.\" A February Vox article similarly documents what it calls the president\u2019s \"long history of racism\" from the 1970s to date. The story references the first time Trump appeared in the New York Times \u2014 Oct. 16, 1973 \u2014 when the paper ran a front-page story about a lawsuit against the then-27-year-old and his father. \"Major landlord accused of antiblack bias in city,\" the headline said. The story begins: \"The Department of Justice, charging discrimination against blacks in apartment rentals, brought suit in Federal Court in Brooklyn yesterday against the Trump Management Corporation, a major owners and manager of real estate here. The corporation, which owns and rents more than 14,000 apartments in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, was accused of violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968 in its operation of 39 buildings.\" The DOJ claimed \"Trump Management had refused to rent or negotiate rentals \u2018because of race and color,\u2019\" the Times reported. \"It also charged that the company had required different rental terms and conditions because of race and that it had misrepresented to blacks that apartments were not available.\" Trump, who was the company\u2019s president, called the charges \"absolutely ridiculous\" and said \"we have never discriminated and never would.\" Trump Management then sued the U.S. government and under a June 1975 agreement the company was required to furnish the New York Urban League with a list of all apartment vacancies every week for two years. Trump Management said the agreement was not an admission of guilt. Nearly two decades later, in 1989, Trump ran an advertisement in New York City papers calling for the death penalty for the black suspects in the so-called \"Central Park jogger\" case, in which five juveniles were accused of raping and beating a young white woman. (The boys were found guilty but their convictions were overturned after another man admitted to the crime in 2002.) Two black ministers called Trump\u2019s ad a \"thinly veiled racist polemic\" and questioned why he was concerned about the jogger but seemingly unconcerned about a black man who had been chased to his death by white teenagers in Howard Beach, Newsday reported. In 1992, the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino lost its appeal of a $200,000 discrimination penalty \"imposed because managers catered to the presumed prejudices of a high roller by removing a black dealer from his table,\" UPI then reported. Recent news stories have also documented allegations of racism about incidents that happened before Trump ran for president. In 2015, for example, the New Yorker reported on Kip Brown, who used to work at Atlantic City casinos including Trump\u2019s Castle. \"When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,\" the magazine quotes Brown as saying. \"It was the eighties, I was a teen-ager, but I remember it: they put us all in the back.\" Searching for \"Donald Trump\" and the word \"racist\" in the Nexis news database, we found hundreds of results, including this headline from a May 2011 Hollywood Reporter story: \"Donald Trump denies he\u2019s racist because one \u2018Celebrity Apprentice\u2019 winner is black.\" In 2012, after a SignOn.org campaign asking Macy\u2019s to sever ties with Trump over his skepticism of Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace, the singer Cher called him a \"racist cretin\" in a tweet."

(Although several surveys of drug use are released on an annual basis, experts told us that this is the only survey that would speak to the specific numerical claim Bush made.) For heroin use, the survey offers two measurements -- heroin use at any time of one\u2019s life, and heroin use during the past 30 days. For the first category -- use of heroin in one\u2019s lifetime -- 2.2 percent of respondents between the ages of 11 and 18 had used it in 2000, compared to 1.1 percent in 2006. That\u2019s a 50 percent decrease. And for the second category -- heroin use in the past 30 days -- 0.8 percent reported using it in 2000, compared to 0.4 percent in 2006. That\u2019s also down by 50 percent. So numerically, Bush has a point. Still, experts said it\u2019s worth taking those numbers with a grain of salt. Testing the numbers One concern is that the percentage of youth using heroin is small, meaning the differences from year to year are small -- and this makes them potentially unreliable. Indeed, the report itself cautions, \"Heroin use in a school population is extremely rare. Nationally, no lifetime prevalence rate for heroin has exceeded 2.4 percent in the 8th, 10th or 12th grades in the past decade. \u2026 Given the extremely low prevalence rates associated with heroin use by Florida students, analyses that attempt to precisely specify or quantify changes over time are subject to error.\" In addition, for both measurements, the biggest drop came between 2000 and 2001, with minimal changes between 2002 and 2006. That seemed curious to Lloyd Johnston, a senior research scientist at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and principal investigator of the Monitoring the Future study, which tracks drug use in the United States. \"While that is possible, I don't think it very plausible,\" Johnston said. \"Rates almost always change more gradually.\" One possible explanation for that pattern, he said, is that the 2000 survey collected its data in December and January, whereas the 2001 to 2005 surveys conducted their data in April and May of those years. A further curiosity, Johnston said, is that one would not expect a one-year decline that steep for lifetime heroin use. From year to year, the pool of respondents is mostly the same. In the first year, the survey includes youth who are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 years of age. The following year, the 18-year-olds drop out and a new group of 11-year-olds joins, but all the other groups are included again. With such modest changes from year to year in the makeup of the age groups, one would not expect a large change in heroin use over a lifetime from one year to the next, Johnston said. \"That makes the lifetime improvement in 2001 highly implausible,\" Johnston said, adding that a sizable change in the 30-day-rates would be more plausible. What was Bush\u2019s role? There\u2019s also a separate issue: Did Bush\u2019s policies help engineer this decline? That\u2019s hard to say, though drug-policy experts in Florida do praise Bush for his work on the issue. James Hall, a drug abuse epidemiologist at Nova Southeastern University, said that Bush gave the issue high priority, including the creation of a drug policy office out of his own office to coordinate law enforcement, treatment, education and prevention. The office -- which was later eliminated by Gov. Rick Scott -- made a \"very significant contribution\" to drug policy in the state, Hall said. In addition, Bush championed community-based anti-drug coalitions that helped consolidate prevention efforts, Hall said. And his wife Columba was also active in drug- and alcohol-abuse issues, he added. Still, such efforts likely had a \"marginal influence\" on heroin-use rates, Hall said. Often, broader issues such as demographic and social trends have a bigger impact. Indeed, it\u2019s worth noting that heroin use among youth was declining nationally during roughly the same period. Johnston\u2019s own study found that heroin use among youth was declining nationally between 1999 and 2007, the full extent of Bush's term in office. \"For the three grades we study (eighth, 10th, and 12th), the combined prevalence of heroin use during the prior 12 months declined from 1.3 percent in 1999 to 0.8 percent in 2007,\" he said. That\u2019s a drop of about 40 percent -- not far from what the Florida-only survey found."

    "doc": "Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio largely battled each other during the Republican debate in Las Vegas, including when Cruz accused Rubio of supporting a bill to let refugees into the country without first being vetted. Cruz singled out what he saw as a major flaw of a 2013 bipartisan immigration bill by the so-called Gang of Eight, which included Rubio and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"Border security is national security, and you know, one of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees, without mandating any background checks whatsoever,\" Cruz said. Did Rubio really back an immigration bill that would have allowed refugees from countries in turmoil to come in sans screening? It appears Cruz should work on his own vetting process. Presidential power The Cruz campaign did not get back to us when we asked how S. 744 \u2014 which passed the Senate (with Cruz voting no) in 2013 but wasn\u2019t taken up in the House \u2014 would have granted the president this power. But when our friends at FactCheck.org looked at a similar claim earlier in December, Cruz\u2019s office directed them to a column by Daniel Horowitz on ConservativeReview.com, a site that named Cruz \"America\u2019s Top Pick\" among GOP candidates. Horowitz highlighted three sections of the bill to justify how the legislation would have opened up the country to substantial refugee risk. \"Had the bill passed in 2013, it would have given the Obama administration power to define who is considered stateless,\" he wrote. \"Most of those likely to be designated as stateless are from Islamic hell holes and would include the Syrians, Somalis, Palestinians, and the Muslim Rohingya in Burma.\" Horowitz told us the bill would have granted Obama sweeping power to bestow refugee status on groups as he saw fit. He also said it did nothing to establish standards for background checks on so-called \"stateless\" refugees, who already can\u2019t be checked because there are no databases or information to consult, an argument Rubio has used to argue for prohibiting entry for Syrian refugees. PolitiFact has found that while there may be data gaps, there is a process to vet Syrian refugees. We spoke to several experts, including two resettlement agency officials interviewed by FactCheck.org. We found that their analyses of the bill don\u2019t support Cruz\u2019s claim about new \"blanket authority\" for Obama to admit refugees without any checks. We\u2019ll start with the big picture. Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration, told us the bill did propose sweeping changes, including allowing the government to identify persecuted groups. That could be almost any group in the Middle East, he said. \"The bottom line is that the bill gave the president huge new power that could have changed the refugee system,\" he said. But in the way Cruz alleged? Other experts said no. For one, the president has long had broad authority over refugee admission limits. \"S. 744 didn\u2019t give the president \u2018blanket authority to admit refugees,\u2019 \" David Bier, the director of immigration policy at the libertarian Niskanen Center, said in an email. \"The president has had the power since the Refugee Act of 1980 to establish limits on refugees in consultation with Congress. S. 744 didn\u2019t affect this authority.\" From 1980-2008, the United States has accepted around 83,000 refugees a year. The Obama administration has said it will accept around 70,000 refugees from around the world in fiscal year 2015. Partly in response to the Syrian refugee crisis, that total will increase to 85,000 refugees in fiscal year 2016 and 100,000 in fiscal year 2017. In 2016, the administration plans to increase the number of admitted Syrian refugees almost six-fold to at least 10,000. What\u2019s more, the Gang of Eight proposal specifically stated that all refugees would still be subject to background checks, Bier added. The average screening time for refugees from across the globe is between a year to a year and a half, involving background checks, interviews and confirmation from several federal agencies. For Syrian refugees, it takes two years on average. Cruz\u2019s claim already misses these important points, but there are some specifics that experts say show his statement is inaccurate. \u2018Stateless\u2019 status One point is whether the bill would have allowed Obama to let in any group of refugees, Syrian or otherwise, and give them legal status. Section 3405 would have allowed the attorney general or the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to provide lawful status to a refugee considered \"stateless\" \u2014 meaning, they had no country to which the United States could otherwise send them. \"A classic case is a person who entered the United States and applied for asylum whose country dissolved while they were awaiting their hearing and decision in the case,\" said Joanne Kelsey, the assistant director for advocacy at the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, which helps resettle refugees. \"If they were denied asylum and ordered deported, there is no country left to accept them as their national.\" Kelsey cited as an example people who were in the United States when the Soviet Union collapsed and new countries were formed from their home regions. But the \"stateless\" classification wouldn\u2019t have been for refugees aiming to get into the United States, only people who are already in the country or would face this situation in the future. Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, another refugee resettlement group, said this would not have changed the number of immigrants allowed into the country. The provision only applied to domestic law, he said, and people would have to prove this status, not just declare it. Persecution problem Another part of the bill about specially designating certain groups of refugees, Section 3403, is an attempt to codify something called the Lautenberg Amendment, an immigration provision that has been in effect since 1989 and must be renewed each year. The amendment has traditionally been aimed at certain religious minorities. By law, refugees seeking asylum in the United States must prove they have a \"well founded fear of persecution.\" Our expert sources said section 3403 would have allowed the president to designate a group of interest to the United States as being persecuted as a whole. Think Christians in Syria or Yazidis in Iraq targeted by the Islamic State. Basically, it allows potential refugees to get in line faster. But instead of making the individual prove they are in danger, the threat would already be associated with their group, moving the rest of the screening process along. Its aim was to streamline the vetting process for refugees, not get rid of it. \"It doesn\u2019t create refugees or allow more refugees to come to the United States,\" Bier said. \"They would still be subject to the normal refugee limit. It would create no additional numbers, but would increase, perhaps, the eligible pool of applicants.\" Deadline dilemma One final piece concerns the current one-year deadline in place for refugees to file for asylum once they arrive in the United States. Section 3401 would have repealed the deadline, and given people who had applications rejected for missing the window another two years to apply again. There are any number of reasons people miss the deadline \u2014 they don\u2019t know they can apply, they\u2019re afraid of government officials or even that they were hoping things in their home countries would get better so they could leave the United States and return. But again, it would only apply to refugees already in the United States, not people seeking to come in the future. Our experts said any worries that this would increase fraudulent immigration are unfounded. \"This provision does not alter any standards or safeguards in the asylum system. All asylum seekers would continue to undergo rigorous security background checks and show that they are admissible to the United States,\" Kelsey said."

    "doc": "Three senators running for the Republican presidential nomination have slim records in Congress, said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press Nov. 1, Bush said that he, on the other hand, \"got to be governor of a state and accomplish big things.\" \"This is about public service, about solving problems. If you look at the three people on the stage from the United States Senate, all three of them have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored. If you look at Hillary Clinton, in 10 years, three bills she sponsored that became law. This is the gridlock that I'm running to try to break up.\" We wondered if Bush was right that the three sitting senators he debated against Oct. 28-- Rand Paul, R-Ky., Marco Rubio, R-Fla. and Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- have only had a combined two bills become law so far.(Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is also a sitting senator running for the Republican nomination, but Bush did not include Graham in his count, as he appeared in an earlier debate for candidates with the lowest poll numbers.) (In March, we looked into Cruz\u2019s track record, and we looked at Clinton\u2019s in June.) We evaluated Cruz, Rubio and Paul\u2019s legislative records using Congressional Quarterly\u2019s BillTrack database and GovTrack\u2019s advanced legislation search. We found that Bush\u2019s statement is accurate in that the three senators have sponsored just two bills that eventually became law. But the claim leaves out some important context, such as outside factors working against the senators and the fact that this is an incomplete measure of a senator\u2019s impact in Congress. Put another way, it\u2019s unclear how much you should read into what Bush said. Serving since 2013, Cruz has been the primary sponsor on 57 bills, one of which has become law. Rubio and Paul both joined the Senate in 2011. Rubio has sponsored 106 bills, and President Barack Obama signed one of them into law. Paul has sponsored 141 bills but none has yet to become law. Cruz\u2019s bill, enacted in 2014, denied admission to the United States any United Nations representative who poses a national security threat (a response to Iran\u2019s chosen U.N. representative). The bill was uncontroversial and passed unanimously in both the Senate and the House. Obama signed Rubio\u2019s bill in 2015. This law, which authorized the State Department to support women\u2019s rights in developing countries, was also uncontroversial and passed both chambers unanimously. All three also have their names on laws as cosponsors: Cruz has three, Rubio has 18and Paul has four. The caveats to Bush\u2019s claim So it\u2019s true that Cruz, Rubio and Paul haven\u2019t had many of their ideas signed into law. But there are several caveats to Bush\u2019s claims. Seniority matters. Cruz has only been in Congress for 2.5 years; Paul and Rubio have been there for 4.5. In 2014, National Journal analyzed which senators have sponsored or cosponsored the most bills that eventually became law and found that the longer a senator had been in office, the more bills they passed. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has passed more than 740 bills and has been in the Senate since 1977. At the time of National Journal\u2019s report, the median was 78 bills passed and belonged to Sen. David Vitter, R-La., who has been a senator since 2005. Who\u2019s in control matters. Until this year, Republicans were the minority party in the Senate, putting Cruz, Rubio and Paul at a disadvantage. It\u2019s expected that the majority leader will schedule bills for his own party more frequently than for the minority, said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Government Affairs Institute. Even within their own party, more junior members\u2019 priorities are at the back of the line. \"First-term senators have a lot of headwinds, particularly when in the minority,\" Huder told PolitiFact when we wrote about Cruz\u2019s record back in March. That said, the Senate\u2019s design allows for individual members to make a difference, even if they\u2019re not in the majority, said Sarah Binder, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert in legislative politics. They make a difference in ways other than just passing laws. They can sponsor amendments to bills, for example, or their bills can get absorbed into broad omnibus legislation. Cruz successfully sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that will give Purple Hearts to those killed or wounded in the shooting at Fort Hood in Texas in 2009. They can also use their platform to shape the national conversation, such as Paul\u2019s efforts to raise awareness of privacy issues and National Security Agency surveillance of citizens' phone and other records. Or, they can put a plug in the opposing party\u2019s agenda, like when Cruz spearheaded efforts to block presidential appointments to push his priorities. \"That's not quite the same as shepherding a bill into law, but it's an example of the ways in which merely counting bills enacted gives short shrift to other ways in which senators can make a difference,\" Binder said. Effectiveness outside of sponsorship. Another problem with simply counting the number of bills passed is that it doesn\u2019t account for individual bills\u2019 political salience. Binder noted that Rubio played a major role in crafting the 2013 Gang of Eight immigration reform bill, and even though that bill did not become law, it was an important piece of legislation that continues to be relevant. And the Senate is only one-third of the lawmaking process (the other parts being the House and the president), so many factors that go into passing a law is out of the sponsor\u2019s hands, Huder said. A Cruz spokesperson told us that his impact in Congress is demonstrated through more actions than just the number of laws passed.We also reached out to the campaigns forRubio and Paul, and we'll update this post if we hear back. Looking at Clinton, Sanders Because Bush mentioned her, we wanted to briefly touch on Clinton\u2019s record, too. Serving as the Democratic senator from New York for eight years (not 10, as Bush said), 2001 through January 2009, Clinton sponsored 416 bills, and three became law. She also co-sponsored 74 bills that were eventually enacted into law. There\u2019s one more senator running for president: Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Of the 190 bills Sanders has sponsored since joining the Senate in 2007, two have become law. He has cosponsored 33 that were enacted."

    "doc": "During the Republican presidential debate in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 26, 2012, Newt Gingrich reiterated a talking point we several times have rated False. But this time, he tweaked the language. Responding to a comment from Rick Santorum about fiscal responsibility, Gingrich said, \"When we balanced the budget with the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, and ultimately had four consecutive balanced budgets, we doubled the size of the National Institutes of Health because we set priorities. It is possible to do the right things in the right order to make this a bigger, richer, more exciting country.\" We thought we\u2019d see whether his new wording about the balanced budget was more accurate.Previously, we rated these statements by Gingrich:\u2022 \"When I was speaker, we had four consecutive balanced budgets.\" (Republican presidential debate, Tampa, Jan. 23, 2012)\u2022 \"I balanced the budget for four straight years, paid off $405 billion in debt.\" (Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa, Dec. 15, 2011)\u2022 \"For four years, we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt.\" (video announcement that he would run for president, May 11, 2011)All earned a rating of False because Gingrich was taking credit for two budgets that he had no role in assembling or shepherding through the House.As we explained in our earlier articles, Gingrich served as speaker from January 1995 to January 1999, when he was a Republican congressman from Atlanta\u2019s suburbs.The federal budget runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits: $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997.By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion.But that\u2019s only two balanced budgets he can plausibly claim credit for. While the federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- came when Gingrich was long gone from the House.In the Jacksonville debate, however, Gingrich modified his statement. This time, he said that the nation \"ultimately had four consecutive balanced budgets.\" That is a more accurate way of putting it.His phrasing in Jacksonville was less boastful than some of his previous claims, such as the one in which he said, \"I balanced the budget for four straight years.\" In Jacksonville, he credited a piece of legislation passed by a Republican Congress and signed by a Democratic president.But he glossed over a pair of tax-raising bills that made a difference, and that Gingrich opposed, including the 1990 budget deal (in which President George H.W. Bush broke his \"no new taxes\" pledge), and the 1993 budget vote, which cost many Democratic lawmakers their seats in the 1994 Republican landslide.\"Like most things in life, what caused the budget to be balanced was multi-factorial, most important of which was the tech boom and the surging economy,\" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. \"You can partially credit the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, but you could also credit the 1993 and 1990 bills that Speaker Gingrich opposed. It's a little too simple to say that the 1997 Balanced Budget Act \u2018balanced the budget.\u2019 \"In fact, when a pro-Gingrich super PAC claimed in an Iowa ad that \"Newt balanced the federal budget,\" we rated the statement Half True for this reason.\"The budget ended up balancing faster than either party expected simply because economic growth was so strong,\" Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us at the time. \"I don\u2019t think either party had much to do with that.\"Stan Collender, a former Democratic staffer for the House and Senate budget committees, added that \"it happened on his watch, but it doesn\u2019t mean that he gets credit for it.

    "doc": "Billions of dollars began pumping through the American economy in 2009 as part of the stimulus program started by President Barack Obama, but somehow Gov. Chris Christie missed that.While campaigning on Nov. 9 in New Hampshire for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Christie took to the airwaves and summed up in one word what the president did to spur job growth during the first half of his tenure: nothing.\"But remember this: (Obama) can complain about Republicans in the House as much as he wants,\" Christie said during an interview on the \"New Hampshire Today\" radio show. \"But in the first two years, he had, you know, huge majorities in the House and Senate, and did nothing with them to create jobs in America.\"Nothing was done to create jobs?Research by PolitiFact New Jersey shows that Christie\u2019s statement ignores the impact of a major piece of federal legislation aimed at creating and saving jobs: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.Signed into law less than a month into Obama\u2019s presidency, the stimulus bill allocated about $787 billion in federal spending and tax benefits.

    "doc": "Saying Texas students face too many state-mandated exams, an East Texas member of the State Board of Education suggested two faraway places enjoy stellar results with minimal government-imposed testing.In an opinion column published in the Dec. 10, 2012, Austin American-Statesman, Thomas Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, said: \"Massachusetts, the envy of all public school systems in the United States, has three state-mandated tests. Finland, which is the envy of all public school systems in the world, has one. That\u2019s right, one.\"We're not going to judge the merits of educational systems. But we have experience counting tests. In August 2012, we rated False a claim that Texas students spend 45 days a year on state-ordered exams after earlier rating Mostly False a claim about the number of testing days in the Austin schools.Yet, as we tucked into this Massachusetts-Finland shout, we noticed Ratliff\u2019s article does not say if he\u2019s critical of every exam given under the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness system. That testing starts in the third grade.By phone, Ratliff told us that he was thinking only of the state's 11 to 15 newly-installed end-of-course exams that high-school students must hurdle to qualify for graduation.So, what of Massachusetts and Finland?Ratliff said he drew his Massachusetts test count from Austin lawyer Dineen Majcher, who helped launch Texans Advocating for Meaningful Student Assessment amid concerns the 2009 Legislature's overhaul of student testing and accountability went overboard.Majcher pointed us to a Massachusetts government web page, for the Bay State\u2019s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, indicating that high-school students should attain \"proficient\" scores on tests in English language arts and math and a test in any of several science-oriented subjects: biology, chemistry, introductory physics or technology/engineering. Students who do not meet the state\u2019s \"proficient\" score on either test can still graduate, according to the agency, by fulfilling an educational proficiency plan entailing more classwork and testing.By email, department spokesman J.C. Considine told us that outside of the state\u2019s high-school tests, students in grades three through eight must take standardized state exams. According to an agency web page, results are used to hold schools accountable for progress toward the federal goal that all U.S. students be proficient in reading and math by 2014.Now let\u2019s flip to Finland.Ratliff pointed us to an article in the September 2011 issue of Smithsonian, the magazine produced by the Smithsonian Institution, saying that students there have outperformed counterparts in other countries thanks to in a focus on well-prepared teachers who decide how best to school their individual pupils. The story also says there \"are no mandated standardized tests in Finland, apart from one exam at the end of students\u2019 senior year in high school.\"The test is the Finnish Matriculation Exam, according to a Finnish government web page, which says the exam\u2019s purpose is to \"discover whether pupils have assimilated the knowledge and skills required by the curriculum for the upper secondary school and whether they have reached an adequate level of maturity in line with that school`s goals. Passing the Matriculation Examination entitles the candidate to continue his or her studies at university.\"According to the web page, the exam is given each spring and fall.However, the exam is not a one-and-done. It\u2019s composed of \"at least four tests,\" one that each student must take in his or her \"mother tongue\"\u2014Finnish, Swedish or Saami\u2014and three others at their choice either on the \"second national language\" or a foreign language; math; or a test in the sciences and humanities, according to the web page, including tests in Evangelical Lutheran religion, Orthodox religion, ethics, philosophy, psychology, history, social studies, physics, chemistry, biology, geography and health education.\"As part of his or her examination, the candidate may additionally include one or more optional tests,\" the web page says.Whoa. Could each student really take more than 10 tests?Pasi Sahlberg, a Finnish expert in education and director general of the Helsinki-based Centre for International Mobility and Cooperation, confirmed by email that the overall standardized exam consists of a minimum of four tests, but students \"if they wish can take more exams.\" Typically, he said, students take five or six tests. These may be spread over a 12-month period, he said, though most students take most of their tests in the spring of their last school year. Notably, too, Sahlberg emailed, Finnish students who focus on vocational training after completing the country\u2019s nine mandatory years of basic education do not have to take a state-mandated exam of any kind. In 2010, 45 percent of the students who continued their schooling after the nine years chose the vocational track, Satu M\u00e4ki-Lassila of Finland\u2019s Ministry of Education and Culture told us by email."

While it is true that some Supreme Court nominees have received unanimous support or met the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, this is not a traditional or universal requirement for confirmation.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article contradicts the claim of a 60-vote threshold. The article states that only four times in modern history has the chamber voted on cloture when confirming a Supreme Court nominee, and both of President Barack Obama's nominees won 60 votes and then some.

The requirement of 60 votes for confirmation is not universal or traditional, and the Senate has confirmed nominees with fewer than 60 votes in the past. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate.",
    "doc": "New Hampshire\u2019s Sen. Maggie Hassan is the latest Senate Democrat to claim that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch should be held to a 60 vote-standard in order to be confirmed. In a letter she wrote on March 28 explaining why she would vote against Gorsuch, Hassan referred to \"the traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees.\" So is 60 votes the \"traditional\" magic number that Supreme Court nominees need to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate? In reality, Gorsuch, like all other Supreme Court Justice nominees, needs only a simple majority to be confirmed by the Senate. And superficially at least, the idea of a 60-vote threshold would seem to be contradicted by the experiences of Clarence Thomas, nominated in 1991 and confirmed on a 52-48 vote, and Samuel Alito, nominated in 2006 and confirmed on a 58-42 vote. However, Senate procedure is complicated, leading to misunderstandings. So let\u2019s walk through the process. How confirmation works First, a nominee must testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Gorsuch did last week. Once the committee passes the nomination -- and the Republican-led committee is expected to easily clear Gorsuch -- it goes to the full Senate. The process requires the Senate majority leader to take the chamber into an executive session, the setting in which nominees are confirmed, according to Worth Hester, the assistant director of the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute. There, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will either get unanimous consent, a process by which every senator agrees to schedule a vote on a nominee, or in the case of an objection, would need to invoke cloture, the process to end debate and force a vote. Under a cloture vote, the Senate agrees to place a time limit on the consideration of a nominee. A successful cloture requires 60 votes. After the cloture vote, Senate rules allow for 30 additional hours of debate, and then a final confirmation vote occurs, according to Sarah Binder, political scientist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. If Senate Democrats filibuster Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, McConnell would need to invoke cloture. Today, there are 52 Republican senators, so under current rules, the Republicans would need eight Democrats to join them to reach the cloture threshold. That\u2019s a difficult challenge in today\u2019s polarized Congress. If there aren\u2019t enough votes for cloture, McConnell could choose to \"go nuclear\" - that is, suspend the rules about how many votes Gorsuch would need to end the filibuster, changing it to a simple majority. (Here\u2019s a more detailed discussion of the \"nuclear option.\") The 60-vote talking point Given the partisan combat over Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, the \"60-vote threshold\" has become a widely repeated Democratic talking point. When we asked Hassan\u2019s staff to clarify her statement about the \"traditional 60-vote threshold,\" they referred PolitiFact New Hampshire to a list of prior Supreme Court nominees, saying that every one confirmed to the Supreme Court since the Eisenhower administration except for two (Alito and Thomas) either received \"unanimous support or has met the sixty vote threshold.\" \"This is the traditional 60 vote threshold that Senator Hassan believes should be maintained,\" said Hassan\u2019s spokeswoman Meira Bernstein. The problem for Democrats who make this argument is that filibustering a Supreme Court nominee and taking a cloture vote is far from \"traditional\" in Supreme Court nominations. In fact, it\u2019s only happened four times in modern history, according to the Washington Post Fact Checker. The chamber voted on cloture when Justice Alito was nominated in 2006, and it did the same in 1968, 1971 and 1986. PolitiFact and the Washington Post Fact Checker have looked skeptically on claims about the 60-vote standard, including comments by Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Bernie Sanders I-Vt., referring to a requirement or a standard of 60 votes. Both of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees won 60 votes and then some. The Senate confirmed Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 by a vote of 68-31, and confirmed Elena Kagan by a roll call vote of 63-37 in 2010. However, while the margins achieved by Sotomayor and Kagan would seem to support Hassan\u2019s argument that confirmations require 60 votes, it\u2019s not that simple. Those nominations were never filibustered, so no 60-vote cloture motion was required. Even though the margins were greater, the final confirmations required only 51 votes."

However, without further clarification or evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is false and the actual cost per person per year for long-term homeless people on Medicaid in Rhode Island is significantly lower than $60,000.\n\nTherefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate for this claim based on the evidence provided.",
    "doc": "The head of Rhode Island's largest homeless shelter argued in a Nov. 12, 2014 Providence Journal commentary that the costs of not finding someone a home can be very high. Anne Nolan, president of Crossroads Rhode Island, reported that, \"In Rhode Island, a recent study showed that among a group of people who had been homeless for a year or more, Medicaid costs averaged about $60,000 per person, which is far higher than the typical $18,096 per person per year for disabled adults on Medicaid and $9,240 per person per year for the average Medicaid recipient.\" That's a huge difference. We were curious about whether those numbers were accurate and why the gap was so large. Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government health-care program for the very poor. Nolan\u2019s commentary referenced the 2013 \"Rhode Island Annual Medicaid Expenditure Report,\" developed by the state's office of Health and Human Services. We located the report, but we couldn't find any numbers that matched Nolan\u2019s. So we emailed her to make sure that was really her source. She replied that the information actually came from a June 1, 2014, report by Providence College sociologist Eric Hirsch, in which he identified 5,986 Rhode Islanders who had spent at least one night in an emergency shelter over a 28-month period and discovered that 2,308 were covered by Medicaid. Their Medicaid expenses totaled $58 million. Hirsch doesn't calculate the cost per person, so we did. It's $10,795 per person per year. That's pretty close to the average for all Medicaid recipients and a far cry from $60,000. So where did Nolan get her $60,000 figure? In his report, Hirsch wanted to make the point that those costs were not evenly distributed among the homeless. \"In fact,\" he wrote, \"the 67 individuals who were homeless for one year or more and had the highest Medicaid bills had total charges of $9,325,375.\" That's $139,185 per person for these 67 people\" over 28 months. \"The corresponding annual charge was just under $60,000 per person,\" Hirsch wrote. But we immediately noticed a problem -- $60,000 isn't the average for all long-term homeless people. It's only for the 67 people who racked up the highest Medicaid bills, a distinction Nolan didn't make in her commentary. When we contacted Hirsch, he explained that, \"We do want to be able to argue that it would be most cost effective to house the most vulnerable.\" In other words, finding housing for 'high cost' homeless are going to save the most money. He said he used an arbitrary cutoff -- expenses of $47,000 or more -- to identify the high-cost users. Because Nolan was talking about all long-term homeless on Medicaid -- not just the 67 with the highest bills -- we asked Hirsh for the information on the larger group. He went back to his data and reported to us that there were 442 long-term homeless people who had, on average, $23,650 in Medicaid charges per person per year. Although that's double the amount for the typical person who was homeless for at least one night, it's dramatically less than $60,000. When we wrote back to Nolan asking if she was aware that the $60,000 figure only applied to homeless Medicaid patients with the biggest bills, she said she had misinterpreted the report. Finally, for the record, Hirsch and Nolan erred when they said the average Medicaid cost is $18,096 per person per year for disabled adults. As Hirsch reported when we questioned the figure based on the state Medicaid report, the correct amount is $21,696."

    "doc": "During an interview on the MSNBC show Morning Joe, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., argued for legislation he\u2019s proposing that would allow guns to be carried into lands controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. To make the case that guns make places safer, Coburn cited a dramatic before-and-after statistic that stems from the lifting of a ban on guns in national parks. Coburn was a leader in the effort to get Congress to approve the change. President Barack Obama signed the national park provision into law, and it took effect in February 2010. \"In 2010,\" Coburn said on Morning Joe, \"everybody said you can't dare let guns go into the national parks, and of course the rapes, murders, robberies and assaults are down about 85 percent since we did that.\" That\u2019s a pretty stunning drop. Is it accurate? When we checked with Coburn\u2019s office, John Hart, a spokesman, acknowledged that his senator had misspoken in a way that overstated the decline. Hart said Coburn\u2019s office had compared FBI crime data on National Park Service land from 2008 to 2011, the most recent year available. By the office\u2019s calculations, the number of violent incidents actually dropped by 12 percent, not 85 percent. \"The numbers show crime rates have declined, but he misspoke when he mentioned 85 percent,\" Hart said. \"On balance, the facts support our conclusion that crime rates would go down under our policy, not the conclusion of the amendment\u2019s critics who said that allowing guns in national parks would lead to more crime.\" However, before we bless Coburn\u2019s revised analysis, let\u2019s look at the original data. Here\u2019s a summary chart for violent crimes in the national parks between 2008 and 2011. Year Murder and non-negligent manslaughter Forcible rape Robbery Aggravated assault Total violent crimes 2008 5 37 66 259 367 2009 3 34 64 206 307 2010 15 45 58 251 369 2011 7 34 58 224 323 Change, 2008-11 +40% -8% -12% -14% -12% Change, 2009-11 +133% 0 -9% +9% +5% A few issues jump out to us. First, murders actually went up between 2008 and 2011, contrary to what Coburn said. More importantly, using 2008 as the \"before\" year in this before-and-after comparison amounts to cherry picking. As we noted, the law went into effect in 2010, so the most obvious way to frame the comparison would be to use the data from 2009 (the last full year before the gun ban was lifted) and 2011 (the most recent year). And as it turns out, the comparison to 2009 is not nearly as favorable to Coburn\u2019s overall point. Between 2009 and 2011, these four categories of violent crimes actually rose collectively by 5 percent. Robberies did decline by 9 percent, but murders more than doubled (from a very small base), the number of rapes was stable and the tally of aggravated assaults -- by far the most common of these four crimes -- rose by 9 percent. Meanwhile, it\u2019s also worth noting that the number of crimes in national parks is generally pretty small, which makes it unclear how much stock anyone should place in year-to-year percentage increases and decreases. Finally, we\u2019ll point out that Coburn\u2019s stated decline may -- or may not -- have been caused by the deterrence of having guns around. But if they were a cause for the decline from 2008 to 2011, what\u2019s to stop someone from arguing that they were the cause of the increase from 2009 to 2011? The numbers alone simply don\u2019t tell us."

    "doc": "Hours after Super Tuesday polls closed in Texas at 7 p.m., voters across the state were still standing in lines to cast their ballots. In one North Texas county, Democratic primary voters reported long lines while Republican voters cast ballots with ease. In Austin, people reported lengthy waits throughout the day and some were still waiting to vote at 10:15 p.m. At Texas Southern University in Houston, the last Democratic voter cast his ballot at 1 a.m. Wednesday. In an appearance on NBC\u2019s \"The Tonight Show\" Wednesday, Hillary Clinton remarked on the long lines in Texas. \"It is so wrong what is being done to try and purge people from voting lists, not let them register or, as we saw in places yesterday, particularly in Texas: The Republican side gets 25 machines, the Democratic side gets five machines,\" Clinton said. \"People were literally standing in line for seven hours. I want to applaud everybody that stood in a line yesterday, because they were doing the right thing for our country. Clintonis right that some voters in Texas stood in line for hours to vote on Tuesday, but is she right about the cause? Were more machines allocated to Republican primary voters than to Democrats in Texas? Clinton\u2019s team did not return a request for comment. Differences by county In Texas, elections are conducted at the local level and procedures differ in each of the state\u2019s 254 counties. For example, in Travis, Harris and Tarrant counties, voters can go to any polling place within the county to vote in the primary and general elections. In other counties, voters are restricted to polling places within the precincts where they live. During primary elections, both political parties work with election officials to agree on how the elections are run \u2014 including selecting the number of polling places and how voting machines are allocated. In Travis County, which also saw long lines, Democrats and Republicans can vote using the same machines at any polling place during the primary. Some polling places in the county saw staffing disruptions early in the day that caused delays, as eleven people responsible for opening different polling locations did not show up for work over fears of catching the coronavirus. In Harris County, an equal number of voting machines for each party was placed at every polling place. Michael Winn, Harris County\u2019s elections supervisor, told the Austin American-Statesman that this created longer lines for Democratic voters since the Democratic ballot drew more interest than the Republican one, and the county has more Democratic voters. Winn said people in Harris County voted in the Democratic primary at a 2-to-1 ratio compared with Republicans \u2014 but two-thirds of voting centers were located in Republican commissioner districts. Local party officials expressed trepidation at Harris County\u2019s plan to divide voting machines equally in emails obtained by the Houston Chronicle. In one Feb. 18 message to county staff, Donna Stanart, the primary election director for the Republican Party wrote: \"A 50/50 split will be a problem at the polls that are going to be heavier for Democrats or heavier for Republicans.\" Harris County Clerk Diane Trautman said in a statement that officials initially believed they were being \"fair and equitable by allocating equal amounts of equipment to each party.\" In Tarrant County, election officials warned of long lines on Super Tuesday after local party officials agreed to have a set number of voting machines for each party, based on a review of past voter turnout data. The plan called for 1,015 Democratic machines and 1,767 Republican machines across the county\u2019s 192 polling sites, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. State lawmakers plan to hold a hearing to investigate the excessive wait times voters experienced and other issues reported by news outlets on Super Tuesday. In a letter to the Texas secretary of state and a handful of local election administrators urging action on improving voting infrastructure in the state, Mimi Marziani, president of the nonprofit Texas Civil Rights Project, outlined the different issues voters experienced on Super Tuesday. \"From the time polls opened to when they closed, voters faced a series of obstacles: polling sites that opened hours late or not at all; broken voting machines and ballot-printers; crashed election websites; too many untrained poll workers; and voters\u2019 names missing from the registration rolls,\" she wrote. \"Then, especially later in the day, many voters in our major cities faced absurdly long wait times due to an inadequate number of polling locations, a lack of operational machines per location, and the failure to properly staff each location. As chronicled by numerous press reports, wait times lasted as long as seven hours at points, particularly in communities of color and on college campuses.\""

    "doc": "Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist and author Tina Rosenberg recently drew attention to a shocking statistic about women\u2019s education in the African country of Liberia. \"This is education in Liberia,\" Rosenberg wrote in the New York Times on June 14. \"A girl is more likely to be married by 18 than to know how to read.\" Liberia was devastated by civil war between 1989 and 2003. More recently, its schools were closed for six months following the outbreak of the Ebola virus in 2014.

Recent data doesn\u2019t support claim Rosenberg, who won the Pulitzer for non-fictionThe Haunted Land: Facing Europe's Ghosts After Communism,told Africa Check that her claim was based on a Liberian database of statistics collected from the United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF). The database reported that 37.9 percent of children are married in Liberia by 18. That is fractionally higher than the female youth literacy rate of 37.2 percent, according to the UNICEF database. The problem is those figures come from 2007 reports and are out of date. The 37.9 percent figure for child marriage appears to track back to Liberia\u2019s Demographic and Health Survey from 2007. The youth literacy figure is likely from a 2007 UNESCO Institute for Statistics\u2019 estimate. The estimate covers women between the ages of 15-24, not just girls 18 and under. The most recent data comes from the country\u2019s 2013 Demographic and Health Survey. Teen marriage rates in Liberia The Demographic and Health Survey presents data in five year increments for people aged 15 to 49. Women who are 18 fall into the youngest age group of 15 to 19. However, the survey is missing data for marriage rates for this age group. Instead, a United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund note on interpreting child marriage data recommends using the next age group: \"Looking at the group of women 20 to 24 years old is simpler and allows for the inclusion of all girls who were married or in union by age 18 within the closest time period for which complete data are available.\" Following this standard, the 2013 Demographic and Health Survey shows that 35.9 percent of Liberian women aged 20 to 24 reported being married by the time they were 18. This method is imperfect because it doesn\u2019t tell us about the chances that a girl under 20 today will have been married by 18. However, it gives us the best estimate for youth marriage rates for a group of young women who could reasonably be called girls. Literacy rates in Liberia The 2013 survey reported a literacy rate of 64.2 percent for women between 15 and 24 years of age. Someone is considered literate if they went to high school or if they can read a whole sentence or part of that sentence. The literacy rate decreases slightly to 58.9 percent when you look at women ages 20 to 24. Other organizations define literacy more strictly. For example, UNESCO doesn\u2019t include people who can only read part of a sentence in the literate population. If we apply UNESCO\u2019s literacy definition to Liberian women aged aged 20 to 24, literacy drops to 51.2 percent \u2013 still much higher than the marriage figure of 35.9 percent."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim that New Jersey lost private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2009 because Democrats increased taxes, fees, regulations, and state spending. The evidence provided supports this claim to some extent, but it also presents conflicting information that challenges the accuracy of this statement.\n\nOn one hand, the article notes that New Jersey had a jobless decade, with more private-sector jobs in New Jersey on January 1, 2000 than were there on December 31, 2009. This suggests that the state did experience a significant loss of private-sector jobs during this time period. Additionally, the governor's comments and those of his spokesperson suggest that the increases in taxes, fees, regulations, and state spending under Democratic leadership contributed to this job loss.\n\nOn the other hand, the article also provides information that challenges the simplicity of this claim. Firstly, the bulk of the private-sector job losses occurred in 2008 and 2009, which were the height of the recession. This suggests that economic factors beyond the control of New Jersey's Democratic leadership may have played a larger role in the job loss. Additionally, the article notes that New Jersey gained 69,300 net jobs in the public-sector during the same time period, which suggests that other factors may have contributed to the state's overall job growth.\n\nFurthermore, the article highlights the complexity of this issue by citing the opinion of Harry Holzer, a professor at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute and the chief economist for the U.S. Department of Labor under President Bill Clinton. He notes that the comparison between 2000 and 2009 is \"extremely unfair\" because the early 2000s were a time of economic prosperity, while the late 2000s were during a recession. This suggests that external factors may have played a larger role in New Jersey's job loss than the actions of its Democratic leadership.\n\nIn conclusion, while the evidence provided does support the claim that New Jersey lost private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2009 due to increases in taxes, fees, regulations, and state spending under Democratic leadership, it also presents conflicting information that challenges the accuracy of this statement.

    "doc": "Just in time for Halloween, Gov. Chris Christie cautioned New Hampshire voters last week to avoid the \"horror movie\" that New Jerseyans have lived through.Here\u2019s how the Republican governor summed up that film\u2019s plot: Democrats increased taxes, fees, regulations and state spending, leading the Garden State to lose private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2009.\"See, look at what happened to us. From 2000 to 2009, we had a jobless decade: more private-sector jobs in New Jersey on Jan. 1, 2000 than were there on Dec. 31, 2009,\" Christie said Wednesday at a campaign event for Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican candidate for governor of the Granite State.\"A jobless decade under Democratic leadership, because what did they do?\" the governor went on. \"Raise taxes, increase regulation, raised fees, and during that period of time, spending went up an average of 16 percent a year.\"The governor\u2019s right about the drop in private-sector jobs, but he\u2019s wrong to attribute that reduction only to tax and fee hikes, regulatory changes and state spending increases. Christie failed to note the impact of the recession, which coincided with the deepest losses of private-sector jobs. Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts told us \"the Governor\u2019s comments are factual and the record of job loss AND economic malaise in the decade dominated by Democratic leaders, who raises taxes, fees and burdensome regulation, speaks for itself.\"First, let\u2019s break down the job figures.According to seasonally adjusted figures from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the state had 3,366,100 private-sector jobs in December 1999 and 3,211,100 in December 2009.That represents a net loss of 155,000 private-sector jobs over the decade. During the same time period, New Jersey gained 69,300 net jobs in the public-sector.But the bulk of the private-sector job losses occurred in 2008 and 2009 -- the height of the recession. The recession technically lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.After five consecutive years of private-sector job gains, New Jersey lost 107,900 jobs in 2008 and 117,000 in 2009.Harry Holzer, a professor at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute and the chief economist for the U.S. Department of Labor under President Bill Clinton, called Christie\u2019s comparison \"extremely unfair.\"\"It's an extremely unfair comparison, since Jan. 1 2000 was the peak of the late-90s boom and Dec. 31 2009 was close to the trough of a terrible recession,\" Holzer said in an e-mail.\"There is no question that the recession contributed, and is likely the dominant effect,\" Holzer added. \"When you go from the strongest labor market in the past 40 years to the weakest one in 80 years, there will be a lot of job loss, and that was true in every state in the country.\"But Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, told us another factor was how New Jersey\u2019s private-sector job gains preceding the recession lagged behind the nation\u2019s growth rate.\"The reasons for that weak performance compared are complex, but they include the loss of competitiveness of the state in terms of attracting, retaining and growing private sector investment and employment,\" Seneca said in an e-mail.\"How much of this loss in competitiveness was due to taxes, regulations, other business costs, and a perceived unfriendly business climate cannot be easily determined, but by the mid years of the decade this deterioration in competitiveness had manifested itself in weak job growth.\""

The evidence comes from an article by Dan Zehr that cites data from Economic Modeling Specialists International (EMSI) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nThe article explains that EMSI analyzed workforce-related data and found that out of the 92,620 net jobs added in the Austin area from 2009 to 2013, 57% had a median hourly wage less than the living wage for a single parent with one child. This means that over half of the newly created jobs in Austin did not pay enough for a family to afford a decent standard of living.\n\nThe evidence also shows that the lower-wage jobs accounted for 394 types of positions, including positions in oil, gas, and mining, as well as loan interviewers and clerks, pest control workers, skin-care specialists, and medical secretaries. This suggests that the problem is not limited to a few industries but rather affects a wide range of occupations.\n\nFurthermore, the article notes that the median hourly wage might not be a perfect way to gauge who exactly is earning enough to get by, as some workers in the 57% may have made more than the living wage for a single parent with a child. However, this does not negate the fact that over half of the jobs created in Austin during this period did not pay enough to support a family.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is reasonable to label the claim \"57% of the jobs created in Austin from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage\" as true.",
    "doc": "Austin isn\u2019t as affordable as it needs to be, mayoral aspirant Steve Adler says on his campaign website, adding: \"Our children cannot afford to live in the Austin where they grew up when they graduate and leave home. Even during a time of historic job growth, 57% of the jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage.\" We wondered about that percentage. By email, Adler\u2019s campaign manager, Jim Wick, said Adler saw the figure in an April 26, 2014, Austin American-Statesman news analysis by Dan Zehr citing data compiled by Idaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists International, which analyzes workforce-related data. That story said that while the Austin metro area had gained thousands of jobs in recent years, inflation-adjusted earnings had fallen. Then came the declaration that drew Adler\u2019s attention, which didn\u2019t speak generally to families or to jobs in Austin alone. \"From 2009 to 2013,\" the article said, \"almost 57 percent of the newly created jobs in the area paid less than the living wage for a single parent with one child ($19.56 per hour), according to data from EMSI and the oft-cited living wage calculator created by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\" That living-wage figure, identical for Travis and Williamson counties, appears on web pages overseen by Amy Glasmeier, an MIT professor of economic geography and regional planning. According to the entries, the living wage is \"the hourly rate that an individual must earn to support their family, if they are the sole provider and are working full-time (2,080 hours per year).\" To our inquiry, Zehr provided a spreadsheet he built based on increases or decreases in jobs across more than 730 professions in the Austin-Round Rock Metropolitan Statistical Area, also showing the estimated median hourly wage for each of the professions. By email, EMSI spokesman Joshua Wright said its median hourly wage data came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and that information was benchmarked to the firm\u2019s own industry-by-industry data drawn from agencies like the BLS and U.S. Census Bureau. By our calculation, some 53,315 of the 92,620 net jobs added in the Austin area from 2009 to 2013, or 58 percent, had a median hourly wage less than the living wage for a single parent with one child. These lower-wage jobs encompassed 394 types of jobs including positions in oil, gas and mining as well as loan interviewers and clerks, pest control workers, skin-care specialists and medical secretaries, according to the spreadsheet. In reviewing these details, we also wondered if the outcomes for Austin workers were as dire as Adler said. For instance, the MIT website presents lower living wages including, for Travis and Williamson counties, $18.51 an hour for two adults and a child; $14.88 for two adults only; and $9.43 for one adult alone. If you focus on earnings at a lower living wage, in turn, you\u2019re going to conclude more workers fared better. According to the spreadsheet, for instance, 40,560 of the 92,620 net jobs gained from 2009 to 2013, or 44 percent, had median hourly wages less than $14.88; 15,099 of the net jobs gained, 16 percent, had median hourly wages less than $9.43. It also occurred to us the median wage might not be a perfect way to gauge who exactly is earning enough to get by. That is, the median wage in each occupation is the boundary between the highest paid 50 percent and the lowest paid 50 percent of workers. It stands to reason, then, that some workers in the 57 percent still made more than the living wage for a single parent with a child. But it\u2019s also so that some of the other 43 percent made less than the same living wage. The limits of public wage data evidently make it difficult to calculate a precise percentage. Next, for an independent look at this claim, we turned to Cynthia Osborne, a University of Texas associate professor and director of the Child and Family Research Partnership at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. By email, Osborne told us the 57 percent figure might be right, but she\u2019d need more information -- particularly the variations in wages around each median -- to reach a conclusion. EMSI\u2019s Wright told us he didn\u2019t have that type of information, but could share the wages for each occupation at specific points along the wage curve. Daniel Dillon, a research associate for the partnership, later said three interpolations drawing on this added detail basically confirmed about 57 percent of the jobs added in the Austin area didn\u2019t pay the living wage for an adult with one child."

    "doc": "Getting companies to pay more in taxes is one of the pillars of Bernie Sanders\u2019 plans for America. The extra revenue plays a key role in everything from universal health care, to tuition-free college, to rebuilding the nation\u2019s aging water mains, bridges and highways. How much does he think is there? \"The largest U.S. companies would owe $620 billion in U.S. taxes on the cash they store in tax havens,\" Sanders tweeted April6, 2016. That\u2019s a fair chunk of change, and we thought we\u2019d see if it held up. By the way, there\u2019s no single definition of a tax haven. The term covers both profits from overseas subsidiaries and the use of offshore accounts in places like Bermuda. The common thread is money is booked in places with lower taxes than the United States. The Sanders campaign directed us to a joint study from Citizens for Tax Justice and US PIRG, both left-leaning organizations. Their analysis began with the more than $2.1 trillion that Fortune 500 companies are holding in accumulated profits offshore for tax purposes. When the foreign subsidiary of a U.S. multinational turns a profit, the money is taxed at the rate where the subsidiary is based. Uncle Sam doesn\u2019t get a penny until the multinational brings the money home. That gets a little confusing because the money might actually be in the United States, but it isn\u2019t on the books of the U.S. parent. In any event, for tax purposes, most of those funds are not formally repatriated or brought back to the United States. The logic is simple: Why pay a higher rate in the United States, formally as high as 35 percent, when you might be paying a fifth that much in a foreign country, such as Ireland? The Citizens for Tax Justice/US PIRG analysts looked at the 57 corporations that actually told regulators how big their tax bill would be if they brought the money home. \"These 57 companies would owe $184.4 billion in additional federal taxes,\" the report said. The analysts made some assumptions and applied the results to the companies that didn\u2019t release this information. The total for all Fortune 500 companies combined? \"They would collectively owe $620 billion in additional federal taxes.\" We asked independent tax scholars what they thought of that estimate. Some of them said it was in the ballpark. Richard Harvey, a former partner at the accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and now at Villanova School of Law, said Sanders might actually be underestimating. Harvey pointed to the foreign earnings that multinationals report as \"indefinitely reinvested.\" Officially, the total is about $2.3 trillion. But Harvey thinks that overlooks a lot of cash. \"The total unrepatriated foreign earnings would be even higher because companies like Apple and Pfizer do not label all undistributed foreign earnings as \u2018indefinitely reinvested,\u2019 \" Harvey said. \"If one assumes that U.S. multinational corporations have approximately $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion of unrepatriated foreign earnings, and the average tax rate on most undistributed foreign earnings is less than 10 percent (in many cases close to 0 percent), then a $620 billion estimate is very reasonable, and may be low.\" Edward Kleinbard, professor of law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff at the U.S. Congress'Joint Committee on Taxation, took a different approach, and reached approximately the same conclusion. Kleinbard took the Joint Committee on Taxation\u2019s estimate of how much revenue would come from a one-time 14 percent tax on those foreign earnings kept overseas. This is in fact what President Barack Obama has proposed in his latest budget. The net haul from that would be about $195 billion. Using that figure, Kleinbard estimated how much would come in if the rate were 35 percent, rather than 14 percent. \"You get to $488 billion,\" he said. \"That\u2019s not perfect, because of how foreign tax credits (offsets to U.S. taxes) would have to be handled, but it\u2019s the right ballpark.\" That\u2019s less than the $620 billion Sanders cited, but as Kleinbard put it, \"it's a honkin' big number.\" The banking giant Credit Suisse estimated the total new revenues at $533 billion. Edmund Outslay, professor of taxation at Michigan State University, thinks Sanders overshot the mark. Outslay told PolitiFact that he questions a key assumption in the study behind Sanders\u2019 number. The study estimates an average tax rate of 6 percent that all Fortune 500 companies are paying overseas today. Because any foreign tax bill is deducted from what a firm owes Washington, the lower the foreign tax rate, the higher the potential revenues for the United States. Outslay thinks 6 percent is unrealistic. \"Some studies I have seen estimate a foreign tax rate of about 16.5 percent,\" Outslay said. \"If this number is more accurate, the total tax to be gained (would be) $550 billion. At 25 percent, the net U.S. tax would only be $320 billion.\" Outslay himself leans more toward a $300 billion figure. In addition to thinking multinationals are paying a higher rate overseas, he also said \"in most cases, the foreign earnings are actually invested in bricks and mortar.\" Those dollars are not cash in the way Sanders talked about this. How the IRS would treat that money is unclear. All this leaves us with a range of estimates of the potential tax revenues, ranging from about $300 billion (Outslay), to $490 billion (Kleinbard), to $550 billion (Credit Suisse), to over $620 billion (Harvey)."

The source cited, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), provides data on gun-related deaths in the United States, but there are several issues with Hillary Clinton's statement:\n\n1. Timeframe: Clinton's statement refers to the time frame since the Democrats debated in Las Vegas, which is not specified. However, the CDC data provided covers a broader time frame than just one month, stretching back to 2013.\n2. Data accuracy: While the CDC data is widely considered the most comprehensive source on gun-related deaths, it has limitations. The data may not include all gun-related deaths, particularly suicides, which make up more than half of all gun deaths. Additionally, the data provided by the Gun Violence Archive is incomplete and does not include suicides.\n3. Context: Clinton's statement could be interpreted as referring to violence inflicted upon one person by another, rather than just gun-related deaths. However, more than 60% of all gun deaths in 2013 were intentional suicides, according to the CDC.\n\nBased on these factors, it is uncertain whether Clinton's claim is accurate.

Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "At the Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for more gun control. \"Just think about this -- since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns,\" she said. The Iowa debate took place Nov. 14, and the Las Vegas debate happened on Oct. 13. Really? Were 3,000 people were killed by guns in just one month? We decided to check it out. When we reached out to the Clinton campaign for evidence, they directed us to the Centers for Disease Control. In 2013 -- the most recent CDC tally -- 33,636 people died in gun incidents. If you divide that by 12, it comes out to 2,803 -- or nearly 3,000 people a month. But Clinton was talking about 2015, not 2013. More recent data doesn\u2019t seem to exist. We surveyed a number of experts, and they all said the CDC is the best source on this topic. A CDC spokesman told us that 2014 data will come out in December. The only alternative we could find is the Gun Violence Archive, which is a nonprofit organization that keeps a running tally of gun deaths by combing through police blotters and news media, among other sources, daily. The Gun Violence Archive\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t comprehensive, though. In 2014, the group counted 12,500 gun deaths in 2014 and 11,500 so far in 2015 -- both less than half of what the CDC counted in 2013. This is largely because the count doesn't include suicides, whichmake up more than half of all gun deaths. The archive will receive 2015 suicide data in about six months, said Mark Bryant, the archive's executive director. He said that their total number of gun deaths could triple when that data is added in. So Clinton is wrong to suggest we can know how many people died from gun injuries since the Democrats debated in Las Vegas. Still, we wanted to know if it was possible Clinton\u2019s claim is accurate for this year, so we ran her number by some experts. \"My call is that Clinton\u2019s claim is not necessarily proven, but it is well in the range of possibility,\" said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor who studies violent crime at the University of Central Florida. In fact, the total for 2015 might be higher than 2013, as gun suicides are up, said Garen Wintemute, an expert in gun violence at the University of California Davis. Homicides are up, too, which would contribute to a higher number of gun deaths this year, Corzine noted. One final note on Clinton\u2019s phrasing: Some could interpret her description of gun deaths -- \"killed by guns\" -- as violence inflicted upon one person by another. However, more than 60 percent of all gun deaths in 2013 were intentional suicides, according to the CDC."

Specifically, the article states that:\n\n1. Protections for people with preexisting conditions predated the ACA by more than a decade through the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in 1996.\n2.

The label \"Conflicting\" accurately reflects this discrepancy between the claim and the evidence provided.",
    "doc": "During a recent appearance on MSNBC, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) answered questions from \"Morning Joe\" co-host Mika Brzezinski about the latest lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. \"The most important part of Obamacare, as you know, Mika, is the protection against preexisting condition discrimination that extended to more than 150 million Americans, folks who get their health insurance through their employer,\" he said. Because, as almost everyone agrees, health care is complicated, we decided to take a closer look at Coons\u2019 statement, especially because much has been written and said \u2014 and put in campaign ads \u2014 about how many Americans have preexisting health conditions and how they gained insurance protections under the ACA. We will not attempt to judge Sen. Coons\u2019 assertion that the ACA\u2019s protection for people with preexisting conditions is \"the most important part\" of the law, although it is often mentioned along with the expansion of Medicaid to millions more Americans with low incomes. We started out by contacting Coons\u2019 office to get the background information on his assertion, but didn\u2019t hear back. So, we moved on to examining the statutes and talking to various experts. First came HIPAA What we found out is what few people realize: Protections for preexisting conditions for most people with job-based insurance predated the ACA by more than a decade. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, is best known for its provisions regarding medical privacy and patient access to their medical records. But the principal purpose of the law was to put an end to what was known as \"job lock.\" That happened when people with preexisting health conditions were afraid to leave one job with insurance for another job with insurance because the new insurance would not cover their condition, or would impose long waiting periods. \"HIPAA was a big advancement at the time in terms of protecting people with preexisting conditions who had employer coverage,\" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor who studies health insurance at Georgetown University. Specifically, HIPAA required that as long as someone had been continuously covered by health insurance for at least 12 months, without a break longer than 63 days, new insurance at a new job could not impose waiting periods for a worker or family member. HIPAA also required insurers who sold policies in the small-group market to sell to all small groups, regardless of health status, and to cover every eligible member of the group, also regardless of health status. Most of the states had already attempted to address the job-lock problem by the mid-1990s, but states could not reach the majority of the population with health insurance because they were covered by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. \"HIPAA basically ratified what most states had already done,\" said Joel Ario, a former Pennsylvania state insurance commissioner who helped implement the ACA for the federal government. HIPAA also tried to smooth the transition from employer-based insurance to individual coverage by requiring insurers to offer coverage to people who exhausted their post-employment COBRA benefits. (COBRA, short for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, was a 1986 law that allowed workers to continue to purchase their employer plans at full cost for up to 18 months.) But HIPAA did not address how much insurers could charge for those plans, and many insurance companies tried to deter enrollment by making premiums unaffordable for nearly anyone who qualified. While the group-to-individual conversion problem was the most glaring gap in HIPAA, it was not the only one. HIPAA did not require employers to offer health coverage nor did it require those who did offer coverage to offer a minimum package of benefits. Most of those gaps were addressed by the ACA. It effectively required large employers to provide a minimum package of benefits (or else pay a substantial fine). The ACA also, for the first time, required insurers to sell policies to individuals with preexisting conditions \u2014 without charging them more. Much of HIPAA was written into the health law, making the relationship between the two measures even more complicated."

The cap's working,\" he said. \"Now remember, property taxes went up 70 percent in the 10 years before I became governor. So you\u2019re having [a] 7 percent a year average.\"Did New Jersey\u2019s property taxes -- the nation\u2019s highest -- jump by 70 percent in a decade? Homeowners may not be surprised to learn that the increase was actually slightly more. Though, when property tax rebates are factored in, the increase is roughly 50 percent.Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an e-mail that the governor\u2019s statement is \"unequivocally true and a glaring illustration of the uncontrolled rise in property taxes in the decade before we arrived in Trenton -- caused by unrestrained spending and overgenerous benefits and the expansion of government at the local and state level.\"The average property tax bill in New Jersey was roughly $4,240 in 1999, according to data from the state Department of Community Affairs.By 2009 -- the year before Christie took office -- the average property tax bill had climbed to about $7,280.That\u2019s a more than 71 percent increase.But there\u2019s also another chapter to the story of New Jersey\u2019s property taxes: rebates.In previous fact-checks, experts told us reductions in property tax rebate programs could be viewed as tax hikes, since they\u2019re intended to reduce the property tax burden of homeowners.In 1999, when the NJ Saver program was started under former Gov. Christie Whitman the average rebate check mailed to homeowners was $111.By 2009, the average rebate was $1,037.When you deduct those rebates from the average property tax bill, the increase over the decade before Christie took office is less than 70 percent.In 1999, homeowners paid an average of about $4,130 in property taxes, with the rebate. In 2009, that figure jumped to roughly $6,240, an increase of more than 51 percent.It\u2019s worth noting Christie stopped delivering checks for property tax relief during his first year in office and changed the program so the rebates came as a credit deducted off property tax bills.In 2011, the average property tax bill was $7,759. With the credit, the average bill was $7,519."

    "doc": "Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, announced on May 4, 2015, that she\u2019d be running for president as a Republican. But a cyber-squatter had moved fast to grab the Web address carlyfiorina.org and flame her. Using a simple gray-and-white color scheme and uninspired fonts, the domain owner recalled Fiorina\u2019s controversial six-year tenure as CEO of the computer maker by addressing visitors to the page this way: \"Carly Fiorina failed to register this domain. \"So I'm using it to tell you how many people she laid off at Hewlett-Packard. \"It was this many:\" At that point, a very long list of frowny-face icons begins. After much scrolling, the page concludes: \"That's 30,000 people she laid off. People with families. And what does she say she would have done differently? \" \u2018I would have done them all faster.\u2019 \"\u2014Carly Fiorina\" Is the cyber-squatter -- who didn\u2019t identify themselves on the site -- correct? The 30,000 number is largely accurate (we fact-checked it back in 2010), but we wondered whether it\u2019s correct that Fiorina actually said she would have rather laid off people faster. First, some background. Fiorina was named CEO of Hewlett-Packard in July 1999, becoming the first woman to lead a Fortune 100 company. She reorganized the company's structure and pushed for a controversial 2002 merger with Compaq Computer Corp. in an attempt to get a greater share of the personal computer market. The merger succeeded, but HP's board fired her anyway in February 2005 (with a $21 million severance package), primarily due to the company's sluggish stock price and missed earnings targets. Her actions at HP spawned detractors as well as defenders. We looked at the numerical part of the claim in 2010, the year Fiorina ran unsuccessfully against incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. The charge was made in an attack ad by Boxer. We found that Fiorina herself cited the 30,000-layoff figure in an interview with InformationWeek on Oct. 16, 2006. \"When we combined the R&D budgets of HP and Compaq, we didn't have to have two R&D teams working on industry standard servers, for instance. We could have one. That's why the merger was such a great idea. We could decrease the cost structure by billions and billions of dollars. In the course of my time there, we laid off over 30,000 people. That's why I understand where the anger came from.\" Fiorina\u2019s staff did not respond to an inquiry. Their official website, by the way, is www.carlyforpresident.com. But did Fiorina say that she wishes she\u2019d done those 30,000 layoffs \"faster\"? This is more problematic. It stems from a 2005 article in Fortune magazine (reprinted here in 2011). The comment came in a section devoted to the departure of some of the company\u2019s senior executives after the merger. Here\u2019s an excerpt: \"Fiorina summarily fired \u2014 within hours \u2014 the head of enterprise sales, Peter Blackmore, and two of his senior executives. The speed and visibility of the move caused the tech industry to view the firings as an unnecessarily cruel public hanging, and criticism of Fiorina flared. She argues back, saying that a hanging it wasn\u2019t and that in truth these people were treated, in the usual HP manner, with \u2018respect, candor, and compassion.\u2019 But she also says that some of the European problems had been ripening for a time and that these three very senior executives clearly \u2018dropped the ball.\u2019 She believes in accountability, she says, so the men are gone. \u2026 \"Under Fiorina (HP) has lost \u2014 via firings, resignations, and retirements \u2014 a noticeable number of its top people. Here\u2019s one indicator of what some people call the \u2018brain drain\u2019: Of the 11 \u2018direct reports\u2019 that Fiorina had in October 2003, one died and five others are gone. Michael Capellas, CEO of Compaq when the merger was done, left early. Former HP employees can also, without much effort, list another 20 well-placed executives who have departed, a few of them going to competitors Dell and storage company EMC. \"Fiorina does not agree, naturally, that there\u2019s been a brain drain. In fact, she believes that one lesson she\u2019s learned while running HP is that she should have moved more quickly in ejecting certain people. Smartened up now, she says, \u2018I would have done them all faster. Every person that I\u2019ve asked to leave, whether it\u2019s been clear publicly or not, I would have done faster.\u2019 \" This puts Fiorina\u2019s comment in a somewhat different light. Rather than musing that she should have laid off 30,000 people faster, the full article suggests she\u2019s referring to a select group of high-ranking executives."

    "claim": "There are \"500 failing schools in North Carolina\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",

    "justification": "The claim that there are 500 failing schools in North Carolina is overstated and misleading. While it is true that some North Carolina public schools have received low grades and have not met their growth goals, the term \"failing\" is too broad and does not accurately reflect the complexity of the issue.\n\nFirstly, the definition of \"low-performing\" schools in North Carolina includes both D and F schools, which means that some schools that are not failing according to traditional standards are included in this category. This suggests that the term \"failing\" is not an accurate representation of the schools' performance.\n\nSecondly, the use of a grading scale that gives more weight to raw scores than student growth ignores the progress that students have made and punishes schools for having students who came to them below grade level. As Eric Houck, a former public school teacher and education policy expert at UNC-Chapel Hill, notes, the rubric does not give much weight to how much students improved in a given year, and instead focuses mostly on raw scores. This means that schools are penalized for having students who are still improving, rather than being considered failing.\n\nThirdly, the number of \"failing\" schools is inflated by including schools that are not actually failing, but have not met their growth goals. While it is true that 225 schools did not meet their expected growth in 2014-15, this does not necessarily mean that they are failing schools.\n\nBased on these points, it is appropriate to label the claim that there are 500 failing schools in North Carolina as Conflicting. While some schools may be underperforming, the term \"failing\" is too broad and does not accurately reflect the complexity of the issue. A more nuanced approach is needed to determine which schools are truly struggling and need intervention.",
    "doc": "In vouching for a law that would allow some struggling public schools to be taken over by charter schools, the state chapter of the conservative group Americans For Prosperity said one in every five North Carolina public schools is failing. \"This Achievement School District legislation is a small first step testing one approach to the long-overdue process of improving 500 failing schools in North Carolina,\" wrote AFP\u2019s North Carolina director, Donald Bryson, on the group\u2019s website. North Carolina has 2,583 public schools, including 148 charter schools. So if Bryson is right about 500 failing schools, that means nearly 20 percent of schools fall into that category. His proposed solution, a relatively new and controversial program called an achievement school district, or ASD, is moving forward in North Carolina. The ASD program was approved by the N.C. House on June 2 (the day after Bryson published his argument) and is now up for a vote in the Senate. The idea is to take a handful of the lowest-performing schools away from their districts and turn them over to charter school operators. Bryson said it\u2019s noteworthy that there are 500 failing schools because such schools \"remain broken education communities, systematically failing to teach tens of thousands of students without any path towards meaningful, long-term reform or improved achievement.\" We wondered if the picture was really so bleak. How many schools are failing? The state has give out school grades since the 2013-14 school year. Last year,146 schools received Fs. That\u2019s a far cry from 500, so we asked Bryson where his number came from. He said he was actually underestimating it \u2013 that there are 547 low-performing schools, according to a state law that defines the term. However, \"low-performing\" is not the same as \"failing\" \u2013the law that Bryson cited includes F schools as well as D schools. And as any slacker can tell you, D\u2019s get degrees. For Bryson to count D schools as failing seems to be self-evidently wrong. But that\u2019s not the whole story. The state gave its schools a grading scale that we all would\u2019ve loved to have had ourselves. While a typical grading scale gives any score below 60 an F and then goes up by 10-point intervals, North Carolina uses the following scale to grade its schools: F: 0-39 D: 40-54 C: 55-69 B: 70-84 A: 85-100 The scores are mostly based on how students do on standardized tests, with a small amount of consideration given to whether the schools met their expected student growth goals. Grades for high schools also include factors like graduation rates. If the state used a traditional scale, every D school (and even some C schools) would have instead received an F. That\u2019s a pretty good argument in Bryson\u2019s favor. We decided we needed to talk to an expert on education policy to determine whether the state had a good reason to give itself this scale, or if it was simply protecting its image. Eric Houck is a former public school teacher who now teaches education policy at UNC-Chapel Hill. He said many academics, including himself, don\u2019t really pay attention to school grades \u2013 including the question of whether the scale is too generous. The rubric doesn\u2019t give much weight to how much students improved in a given year, Houck said, and instead focuses mostly on raw scores. He said that punishes schools for having students who came to them below grade level and largely ignores how well teachers did getting those students caught up. \"The entire grading system is a little suspect in terms of being able to accurately identify what schools are actually failing,\" he said. Using growth to measure schools The \"low-performing\" metric that Bryson cited includes all D and F schools that didn\u2019t meet their growth goals, as well as those that met their growth goals. Those that exceeded their growth goals are not considered low-performing. That\u2019s a bit more in line with Houck\u2019s philosophy on how to best judge schools, but it\u2019s still misleading to say all those students are being left behind. By equating \"low-performing\" with \"failing,\" Bryson\u2019s claim considers a school to be failing if its average student is a D student whose scoresare improving as much as the state expects. A reasonable person wouldn\u2019t say that student is failing. He\u2019s below average, but above the threshold for failure and on track for improvement. And nearly half of the schools Bryson is talking about, 225 of them, arein that category. Paying a bit more attention to growth, like Houck suggested, we found that a better estimate of the number of failing schools could range from 80 to 415, depending on how much you trust the state to have given itself a fair grading scale. 80: The number of F schools in 2014-15 that did not meet their expected growth. 146: The number of F schoolsin 2014-15. 299: The number of low-performing schools that did not meet their expected growth (out of 547 total low-performing schools). 415: The number of schools that scored 59 or below in 2014-15 and thus would\u2019ve received an F on a traditional grading scale, and which also didn\u2019t meet growth goals."

Is it true that 70 percent of Republicans \"don\u2019t think Donald Trump is the right guy?\" The Cruz campaign referred us to Trump\u2019s Real Clear Politics polling average of 34.2 percent, as of Feb. 17, 2016. This figure represents the portion of Republican primary voters who prefer Trump as the party\u2019s nominee. \"The point is, close to 70 percent of Republicans are choosing someone else,\" said Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips.

Even though Trump isn\u2019t the top pick for many Republican primary voters, a good chunk of them would be perfectly happy with him (or Cruz or Rubio for that matter) as the party\u2019s nominee. Trump was the first or second choice for 47 percent of Republicans in a Fox News poll, for 38 percent in a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, for 44 percent in a USA Today/Suffolk University poll and for 52 percent in The Economist/YouGov poll. A similar portion of GOP voters (39 to 45 percent) named Cruz and Rubio as their top two picks. Trump is also viewed favorably by most of the party: about 62 percent of Republican voters in a Quinnipiac University poll and 62 percent inThe Economist/YouGov poll. Cruz and Rubio commanded similar numbers. Conversely, in the Quinnipiac poll, more Republicans (31 percent) had an unfavorable opinion of Trump than Cruz or Rubio (23 percent). The three men clocked similar numbers in TheEconomist/YouGov poll. Trump does the worst when voters are askedif they could see themselves supporting him for the nomination. In a Feb. 17NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 42 percent of Republicans said no. In comparison, 33 percent could not see themselves supporting Cruz, and 28 percent said the same about Rubio. And finally, most Republicans would support any of the three men if they were the party\u2019s nominee according to a CBS poll.

This might be explained by the turbulent situations that drive refugees from their homesand the on-again, off-again travel ban placed on refugees. It's also important to remember the pool of refugees we're talking about is about 1,400people.

The number of refugees entering the United States from the seven countries targeted in the order has steadily increased since Feb. 3, while the refugee arrivals from countries not affected by the order has fallen, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center.

    "doc": "Republican voters can\u2019t count on Donald Trump to appoint a conservative Supreme Court justice, said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. With the unexpected passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative legend, Republicans are hoping to thwart President Barack Obama\u2019s chance to nominate a liberal replacement in his final year. Their hope is that the next president will be a Republican who would pick a conservative appointee. Trump, however, \"does not care about conservative justices on the court,\" Cruz said of his opponent, in a Feb. 14 interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s This Week. \"You know, the one person he has suggested that would make a good justice is his sister, who is a court of appeals judge appointed by Bill Clinton,\" Cruz said. \"She is a hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge. And he said she would make a terrific justice.\" We wondered, who is Trump\u2019s sister, and has Trump said he only wants his sister on the court? Who is Trump\u2019s sister? Trump\u2019s older sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, is a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in New Jersey. Cruz is correct that President Bill Clinton appointed Barry to this post in 1999. Prior to this position, Barry was a federal judge for the U.S. District Court in New Jersey. President Ronald Reagan nominated her for that post in 1983. Is Barry a \"hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge,\" as Cruz said? Barry isn't one for trumpeting her political views, and she has avoided talking to reporters. The New York Times wrote a profile of her in August, for example, but she declined an interview. So we\u2019re limited in what we know about her politics. Trump himself said in a Feb. 15 press conference, \"I don\u2019t even know what her views are.\" We think Cruz is referring to the fact that Barry wrote the majority opinion in a2000 panel ruling that found a New Jersey law banning partial-birth abortions to be unconstitutional. \"It is clear that the Act is unconstitutional because it creates an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion,\" Barry wrote. An interesting tidbit: Current Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative George W. Bush appointee, was also a Third Circuit judge at the time. He heard the partial-birth abortion case, too, and sided with Barry, arguing that the Supreme Court had ruled similar bans unconstitutional. So it seems a bit unfair to pin Barry as \"hardcore pro-abortion\" based on this case alone. We couldn\u2019t find any other indications of Barry\u2019s position on abortion. Trump addressed the issue in his book The America We Deserve, saying Barry declined to answer questions about her personal views on abortion at her 1999 Senate confirmation hearing. We were unable to locate a transcript of the hearing. Barry is a well-respected judge on the federal appeals court, which is where quite a few Supreme Court justices come from. But would Trump actually appoint her? He\u2019s only kidding, he says. Trump did say his sister would make a \"phenomenal\" Supreme Court justice, but he was quick to say he wouldn\u2019t appoint her. Back in August, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Halperin asked Trump if there was anyone he would consider for the court if the opportunity came up. Trump declined to name specific people. But then Halperin asked, \"How about your sister?\" \"I think she would be phenomenal,\" Trump said. \"I think she would be one of the best, but frankly I think she is \u2014 we'll have to rule that out now, at least temporarily.\" And in an October interview with Fox, Trump added that Barry would probably decline the offer, as she is \"very happy where she is.\" Minutes after Cruz\u2019s This Week interview Feb. 14, Stephanopoulos asked Trump if he would nominate his sister. Trump said that he was just kidding back in his August Bloomberg interview. \"My sister, she also happens to have a little bit different views than me, but I said in that in a very joking manner,\" Trump said. \"But my sister obviously would not be the right person. It's a conflict of interest for me.\" Cruz also said Trump has only suggested his sister as a potential nominee. That may have been accurate for a while, but at a Feb. 13 debate in South Carolina \u2014 the day before Cruz made this claim \u2014 Trump named two potential nominees, neither of whom are members of the Trump family. Trump suggested Diane Sykes, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and Bill Pryor, who sits on the 11th Circuit. Both are conservative George W. Bush appointees. Cruz was the only other candidate at the debate to float a name: Mike Luttig, a former federal judge for whom Cruz clerked in Virginia. A spokesman for Cruz's campaign emphasized that up until the debate, Trump hadn't named anyone but his sister as a potential Supreme Court pick"

    "doc": "At a news conference last month, U.S. House candidate and state Rep. Jack Flanagan explained his vote to continue the state\u2019s expanded Medicaid program. Flanagan, a Republican, supported the legislation because those in the second congressional district were relying on the expanded plan, he told reporters. \"When I looked at the actual layout -- Coos County, Sullivan County, there was a significant number of people -- I think it\u2019s almost 5 percent if not more -- in those counties. So, looking ahead and knowing those people could use the support, that\u2019s why I voted\" for the program, he said. Flanagan\u2019s assertion caught our eye. While the overall number of those on the expanded program has been stated repeatedly \u2013 about 48,000 individuals \u2013 less has been said about who those people are and where they live.So we decided to check out Flanagan's statement. Let\u2019s start with the district boundaries. New Hampshire\u2019s second congressional district stretches from the very top of the state to the very bottom, and generally covers the western half. It\u2019s currently represented by U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, a Democrat. As Flanagan noted, the district encompasses all of Coos and Sullivan counties. It also includes all of Cheshire County. Much of Grafton, Merrimack and Hillsborough counties are in the district, too, along with a slice of Rockingham. That\u2019s a lot of space, and as you might expect, use of the expanded Medicaid, which offers subsidized health care to people making less than $16,000 a year, isn\u2019t uniform across the district. Towns and cities in sparse Coos and populated Merrimack counties face very different economic challenges, after all. The next piece of the puzzle is the actual usage of the program. The state\u2019s Health and Human Services department has produced a number of maps through its division of Public Health Services that show, as of January, how many residents across the state use expanded Medicaid.According to this information, Coos County saw the greatest use of the expanded Medicaid program, with 5.38 percent participating. Sullivan County, the second one named by Flanagan, had 4.28 percent of its residents enrolled in the program. These figures include just the expanded program, not all Medicaid enrollees. As expected, numbers vary in the other counties included in the district. Only 3.77 percent of the population of Cheshire County is enrolled. Merrimack County has 3.75 percent of residents participating, while Hillsborough has 3.58 percent. Grafton County is broken up in an unusual way on the map -- Hanover and Lebanon are broken out. Between them, the communities have only 1.72 percent of their residents in the program. The rest of the county has a 4.19 percent enrollment. While the numbers can be sliced and diced further -- the state also issued a town-by-town breakdown of enrollments -- Flanagan was speaking about county numbers, so this rough breakdown should be sufficient. The two counties Flanagan specified, Coos and Sullivan, indeed have the highest participation rate in the expanded Medicaid program. Only the former is over 5 percent, though. Bolstering his argument, both have higher enrollments than the state as a whole, which stands at about 3.5 percent. When reached for comment, the representative pointed to the same set of data from the state. \"I was considering Coos when I made that statement, however Grafton and Sullivan counties are still high, percentage wise,\" Flanagan wrote in an email."

    "doc": "Billionaire Donald Trump won an easy victory in Florida\u2019s 2016 Republican presidential primary \u2014 so easy, he said, that he garnered an unparalleled amount of support in the process. \"Out of 67 counties (in Florida), I won 66, which is unprecedented. It's never happened before,\" Trump said March 21. It is true that he won 66 counties (Sen. Marco Rubio won his birthplace of Miami-Dade before dropping out of the race), but Trump\u2019s nearly unanimous win is hardly unprecedented. We looked at county-by-county election results from the state\u2019s Division of Elections website. Big wins aren\u2019t altogether unusual in Florida, if you go back just a few years. Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich split the state in the 2012 Republican primary, and both the GOP and Democrats split their primaries three ways in 2008. But in 2004, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry won all 67 counties for the Democrats. That feat was repeated by both parties in 2000, when Vice President Al Gore won all 67 for the Democrats and Texas Gov. George W. Bush won all 67 for Republicans. In 1996, Bob Dole took 66 of 67 counties for the GOP primary \u2014 but really, the 67th was a tie at 190 votes each for Dole and Pat Buchanan in Washington County. Bill Clinton took 63 counties in 1992\u2019s Democratic primary. Paul Tsongas won Alachua, Martin, Seminole and Palm Beach counties. Pat Buchanan mounted a primary challenge to incumbent president George H.W. Bush that year and won Hardee County. Bush nabbed the other 66. In 1988, George H.W. Bush won 64 counties, losing three to Pat Robertson in the GOP race. Counties were split over their Democratic candidate, but Michael Dukakis won the state. Walter Mondale and Gary Hart divided the state for Democrats in 1984, with Jesse Jackson winning one county and John Glenn two. The state\u2019s online data only goes back to 1978, but there were enough examples to prove Trump wrong in this case. In 1980, Jimmy Carter won 100 percent of Florida counties for the Democrats. But Trump can lay claim to beating the primary record of Republican hero Ronald Reagan. The actor defeated his eventual vice presidential running mate George H.W. Bush by 64 counties to 3. In addition to Alachua County, Bush took Dixie and Union counties by a single vote."

The evidence provided in the article supports the idea that Mitt Romney, not President Obama, made this statement. The article quotes a report from Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein, which projected that the economic stimulus plan would create 3-4 million jobs by the end of 2010 and predicted unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. However, the report states that these estimates were projections rather than promises, and included heavy disclaimers regarding margins of error and uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it can be argued that Romney's statement about President Obama's promise to keep unemployment below 8% is incorrect. President Obama did not make this promise, and the report he was referring to was an analysis of potential job creation and unemployment rates under different scenarios, rather than a promise or guarantee. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "Grainy video of Mitt Romney talking to big-dollar donors in Florida has the political world in a tizzy.Romney\u2019s remarks in the secretly recorded video that 47 percent of Americans believe they are victims entitled to government help prompted a swift response from the Barack Obama campaign and a late-night explanation from Romney himself.We\u2019ll be checking several claims from Romney\u2019s remarks at the May 17, 2012, fundraiser in Boca Raton, Fla. Here we\u2019ll examine one we\u2019ve heard before. It was tucked into Romney\u2019s description of how he can win over voters who supported Obama four years ago but are disappointed now.\"Those people that we have to get, they want to believe they did the right thing but he just wasn't up to the task. They love the phrase that he's \u2018over his head.\u2019 \u2026 The best success I have at speaking with those people is saying, you know, the president has been a disappointment. He told you he'd keep unemployment below 8 percent. Hasn't been below 8 percent since,\" Romney said.Did Obama promise to keep unemployment below 8 percent? Not exactly. Projection or promise?The source for Romney\u2019s statement -- and others like it -- is a Jan. 9, 2009, report called \"The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan\" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Their report projected that the economic stimulus plan would create 3 to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. The important word here is projection. The economic analysis wasn\u2019t a promise, it was an educated assessment of how events might unfold. And it came with heavy disclaimers. \"It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,\" the report states. \"There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.\" There's also a footnote that goes along with the chart stating: \"Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action.\"Of course, we now know the unemployment rate did exceed 8 percent. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and has decreased very slowly. In August 2012, it was 8.1 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics."

The institute maintains an online database of military expenditures since 1988 for 172 countries.In 2011 -- the most recent year available -- the United States led the world in military spending at $711 billion, marking 41 percent of the world total, according to the institute. The next top 12 spending nations accounted for a combined total of $670.9 billion, according to the institute.U.S. expenditures were nearly five times higher than China, the second-highest nation with an estimated $143 billion in military spending. Russia was in third place with estimated spending of $71.9 billion.We found similar results when we reviewed the data released by The International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank which tracks military spending in 170 countries for its annual \"Military Balance\" report.According to IISS figures released last year, the United States\u2019 defense budget in 2011 was $739.3 billion, making it the largest in the world. The combined total of the next top 9 nations was $486.7 billion, according to IISS figures.Referring to U.S. military spending, Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a defense expert with the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, explained in an e-mail: \"It is large because we have overseas interests all over the world, and we put a high premium on responsiveness and qualitative superiority.\"But the United States is poised to restrain its defense expenditures in the coming years.In addition to reduced costs from winding down the war in Afghanistan, the Budget Control Act of 2011 contains provisions that limit spending increases in defense and other areas over the next decade.It\u2019s worth noting that calculating military expenditures for worldwide comparisons is inherently challenging, in part because there is no single definition of what constitutes military spending.As the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute points out on its website, \"the lack of sufficiently detailed data makes it difficult to apply a common definition of military expenditure on a worldwide basis.\""

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for Woodrow Wilson's claim that the United States is still paying interest on the debt from World War I because the evidence presented in the article contradicts his statement. While it is true that the US government borrowed a significant amount of money to finance its operations during World War I, including $30 billion in 1917, the evidence shows that this debt has been rolled over and repaid over time.\n\nFirstly, the article states that the initial debt issued to pay for the war no longer exists, but rather it has been \"rolled over.\" This means that the Treasury sells new bonds to pay off the old bonds that are maturing, effectively replacing the original debt with new debt. As Hooks, an economist at Washington & Lee University, explains, \"in that sense, you could say the debt is still out there.\" However, it would be difficult to assign any specific current bond to that historical incident.\n\nSecondly, the article quotes several experts who are skeptical of Napolitano's characterization of rolled-over debt as being \"not paid back.\" Neil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor, states that rolling over debt means that federal elected officials have decided to borrow money to finance other priorities rather than increase taxes. All well-run businesses do this, he says. This suggests that the US government's decision to roll over its debt is not indicative of failing to pay back the original debt.\n\nFinally, the article mentions that there are still eight Liberty Bonds and two Victory Notes that haven't yet been redeemed, but these financial instruments have been mature since 1947, so they haven't earned any interest for almost 70 years. This suggests that the original debt has been paid off and is no longer an ongoing concern.\n\nBased on the evidence presented in the article, it can be concluded that Woodrow Wilson's claim that the US is still paying interest on the debt from World War I is incorrect. While some of the debt from the war has been rolled over and repaid over time, the original debt has been paid off and is no longer an ongoing concern. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "The recent fight over raising the debt ceiling -- the limit on how much debt the federal government can carry at a given time -- has brought added scrutiny to the history of the United States\u2019 reliance on debt to finance its operations. During a recent Fox News interview, legal commentator Andrew Napolitano offered an arresting factoid. \"The government today will borrow money to pay debt on money it has already borrowed and spent,\" he said. \"I\u2019ll give you one statistic. Woodrow Wilson borrowed $30 billion to fund World War I in 1917. That money has not been paid back. And we are still paying interest on it. That\u2019s 95 years ago.\" Really? We\u2019re still paying off the cost of World War I? We checked with experts to see if Napolitano is correct. The United States government borrowed a fair amount during the World War I era. Hostilities related to World War I began in 1914, but the United States officially entered the war against Germany in April 1917 and against Austria-Hungary in December 1917. According to Treasury Department statistics on annual debt loads for the United States, the nation\u2019s total debt rose by $23.8 billion between July 1, 1916 (the last available figure before war was declared on Germany) and July 1, 1919 (the first available date after the armistice that ended the war). That\u2019s less than Napolitano said, but a different Treasury data source -- the department\u2019s annual report from June 1920 -- said the U.S. had borrowed a total of $37 billion to finance the war. These two figures average out to about $30 billion, so we\u2019ll accept Napolitano\u2019s figure as a plausible estimate. To finance the war, the government sold Liberty Bonds and Victory Loans. Our first thought upon hearing Napolitano\u2019s claim was that there were still Americans with fraying security certificates in their safe deposit boxes who receive periodic interest payments from the Treasury. But this is not the case. When we contacted the Treasury Department for this story, officials did some digging and found that there are actually still eight Liberty Bonds and two Victory Notes that haven\u2019t yet been redeemed. However, these financial instruments have been mature since 1947, so they haven\u2019t earned any interest for almost 70 years. (Their total value, however, isn\u2019t shabby -- almost $4.2 million.) Napolitano told PolitiFact that he wasn\u2019t referring to ongoing interest payments. Instead, he was referring to the fact that the World War I-era debt was \"rolled over.\" For further explanation, we turned to Linda M. Hooks, an economist at Washington & Lee University. \"The initial debt issued to pay for the war no longer exists,\" Hooks said. \"However, Treasury debt gets \u2018rolled over.\u2019 That is, the Treasury sells new bonds to pay off the old bonds that are maturing. So those bonds did mature and get paid off, but the Treasury sold new bonds to pay them off, and then sold new bonds when the second batch matured, and so on.\" So, Hooks said, \"in that sense, you could say the debt is still out there. However, it would be very hard to assign any specific current bond to that specific historical incident.\" Other experts are even more skeptical of Napolitano\u2019s characterization of rolled-over debt as being \"not paid back.\" Since the public debt has not been zeroed out since 1835, by Napolitano\u2019s argument, \"we are still paying off Civil War debt or even the cost of the 1848 Mexican War,\" said Franklin Noll, a historian of United States government financial and monetary history. And that, he added, doesn\u2019t make sense. Neil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor who specializes in economics, agrees, calling Napolitano\u2019s claim \"obviously false.\" All rolling over debt means, he said, is that federal elected officials have decided that it makes more sense to borrow money to finance other priorities than to increase taxes. \"Every well-run business does this,\" Buchanan said. \"A company might borrow money to build a new office headquarters, and years later its total debt might be higher than it was when the headquarters was financed. That doesn't mean the company is still paying interest on the loans to build the headquarters. It means that the company found that it had better things to do with its money than reduce its debt. Any growing enterprise will do that, and the U.S. economy has been growing for over 200 years, with occasional setbacks.\""

    "doc": "The 2019 holiday shopping season is upon us. A new NerdWallet survey estimates more than 223 million Americans (88%) plan to purchase gifts this holiday season, spending an estimated $184 billion. Of course, many of those purchases will come in brick-and-mortar stores, but increasingly shoppers are making their buys online. Some believe that trend could get a boost this year due to the short window between Black Friday and Christmas -- 26 days from Thanksgiving to Christmas, down from 32 in 2018. With that backdrop, state Rep. Rob Hutton, R-Brookfield, used the Dec. 4, 2019 GOP weekly radio address to tout his soon-to-be introduced bill to increase the penalties for stealing mail and packages. Hutton started circulating the proposed bill for co-sponsors Dec. 12, 2019. \"Of course, it\u2019s already against the law to steal mail or any other item,\" Hutton said. \"Our laws need to keep up with the shift toward purchasing products online.\" He also said: \"A recent study showed that nearly half of all gifts bought for the holidays are now purchased online. Unfortunately, another study showed as many as 1 in 4 people have had a package stolen from their residence.\" Is he right about the number? The evidence When asked to provide backup for the claim, Hutton\u2019s staff pointed us to the \"2019 Porch Package Theft Report\" by Shorr Packaging Corp., an Aurora, Ill.,-based distributor of packaging products, equipment and services. Here is what the company\u2019s website says about the methodology: \"We surveyed 1,052 online shoppers and asked a variety of questions related to online purchasing habits, package delivery tendencies, and security as it relates to receiving goods purchased online. All respondents live in the U.S., are between the ages of 18-100 and have indicated that they purchase items online through retailers. The survey was conducted between 10/30/2019 and 10/31/2019.\" Shorr Packaging teamed with marketing and analytics agency Garrison Olson on the survey. Kyle Olson, co-founder of Garrison Olson, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin the participants were selected using SurveyMonkey's audience network -- that is, people who volunteer to take surveys. The margin of error is +/- 3%. Here is the relevant line from the report: \"Nearly 1 in 4 online shoppers surveyed (24%) had personally experienced package theft, a 7% decrease compared to the 31% of self-reported package theft victims in our 2017 Package Theft report.\" So, the first part of that sentence tracks with Hutton\u2019s claim on the current number, though the second part suggests security precautions may be making a difference. Indeed, the report itself notes: More than half those surveyed had taken some sort of precautions to prevent package theft, with 45% scheduling a delivery and 33% relying on home security tools. Some 64% of victims have sent packages to a location other than their home to prevent theft. And 78% have changed their plans to be home when a package arrived, even though the package did not require a signature. The study also reported that one of the hottest items on many people\u2019s holiday shopping list this year is a video doorbell. In fact, of the respondents who have been a victim of package theft, 41% said they had purchased a video doorbell. We did find two other sources, both of which are similar surveys, that bolster Hutton\u2019s claim. Security.org surveyed 1,011 shoppers in mid 2019 about package delivery. Only those who have packages delivered to their homes were asked to participate. That effort found \"close to 40% of people have been the victims of so-called porch pirates, who snatch package deliveries from porches, stoops and doorsteps.\" Meanwhile, home security company Canary said in its November 2019 \"Porch Pirates Beware!

The survey was conducted online between Oct. 24 and 25, 2019. A margin of error was not provided. Just how big is the problem? According to Security.org, federal data does not distinguish package theft from other larceny, so it\u2019s not clear exactly how many package thefts take place every year across the country. But according to the FBI\u2019s 2017 Crime in the United States report, the most recent annual data available, more than 5.5. Million larceny thefts were reported across the country"

Supporters said the bill will ensure the state does not deplete the state\u2019s unemployment trust fund, which is how Missouri saves money for unemployment benefits during recessions. When the fund reaches zero, the state must borrow money from the federal government, which involves paying high interest rates.Employers pay separate taxesto fund boththe stateand federal unemployment trust fund. The bill\u2019s fiscal notesreport it could save the state\u2019s unemployment fund up to $82 million per year. The House passed HB 288 on February 23, and it now awaits a vote in the Senate. In the days after the House voted, Rep. Allen Andrews, R-Grant City, was quoted about the billin an article on KMA Land, a website produced by a radio news station based in Shenandoah, Iowa. Andrews said, \"Missouri is actually the only state that has been forced to borrow money from the federal government to pay for unemployment benefits during each of the last five economic downturns. Thisisn\u2019t the onlytimeAndrews has stated this.A fewlegislatorsand theMissouri Chamber of Commercehave repeated the statement as well. So we wanted to check it out. Missouri borrowing Andrews never answered PolitiFact\u2019s many emails and calls, so we went to find the data on our own. According to theNational Bureau of Economic Research, the last five recessions were To find out whether Missouri borrowed a Federal Title XII loan to pay for unemployment benefits deficits during those time periods, we went to theU.S. Department of Labor. The data showed that at year\u2019s end of the following years, Missouri had borrowed money to fully fund unemployment benefits claims: These year years don\u2019t exactly match up with the recessions \u2014Missouri borrows just after the recessions\u2019 end dates \u2014but that\u2019s normal, said Robert Pavosevich, lead actuary for the U.S. Department of Labor. States usually take out loans at the end of a recession, not in the middle, when unemployment remains high, he said. In fact, Pavosevich said that using the strict definition of a recession \"wouldn\u2019t be fair.\" \"When people talk about recession, generally they\u2019re talking about when unemployment is high, not the official date,\" he said. \"(Andrews) probably meant the time period overall.\" So far, Andrews is correct: Missouri has borrowed money from the federal government in the last five recessions to make up for deficits in its unemployment trust fund \u2014but is it the only state to do so? The only state A review of data on borrowing by the other 49 states along with Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands confirms that Missouri is indeed the only state to receive a loan from the federal government for the unemployment trust fund during the past five economic downturns. There are five close contenders that borrowed during four of the five recessions: Neither Michigan nor Connecticut borrowed for the 2001 recession, while Minnesota, Texas and Illinois didn\u2019t borrow for the 1990-91 recession. Pavosevich said there were two other ways that could invalidate Andrews\u2019 claim. States could have borrowed and paid back a loan within a year, which wouldn\u2019t have been represented on the data available on the department\u2019s website. Additionally, several states use private borrowing to pay back the Title XII loan to the government by selling state bonds to the private market; these states have outstanding loans for unemployment benefits but not to the government. Pavosevich looked into the data, which isn\u2019t publicly available, for these two caveats \u2014paying the Title XII loan within the year and private borrowing \u2014and found that Missouri is the only state to to have taken out a loan during or right after each of the last five recession. \"(It) appears that the statement is true if you consider recessionary periods rather broadly,\" Pavosevich concluded in an email."

    "claim": "Says Alex Sink supported \"a $5.2 billion increase in Florida's debt.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim that Alex Sink supported a $5.2 billion increase in Florida's debt because the evidence provided in the article contradicts the claim. The article explains that during Sink's term as CFO, the state Legislature was responsible for appropriating money for projects, and the Cabinet, including the CFO, signed off on the Division of Bond Finance's bond issues after the Legislature appropriated money for projects. Additionally, the article notes that the entire U.S. economy suffered during Sink's term as CFO, and Florida's trends of increasing debt are consistent with the nation's. These points suggest that while Sink may have played a role in increasing Florida's debt, it is not accurate to place sole blame on her.\n\nThe article also highlights several points that contradict the claim:\n\n1. The CFO does not have veto power over bond appropriations, so Sink could not \"vote down\" the Legislature's bond appropriations.\n2. The entire U.S. economy suffered during Sink's term as CFO, which means that Florida's increasing debt is not unique to Sink's tenure.\n3. The state Legislature is responsible for appropriating money for projects, and the Cabinet, including the CFO, signs off on bond issues after the Legislature appropriates money for projects.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the claim that Alex Sink supported a $5.2 billion increase in Florida's debt is an oversimplification of the complex financial dynamics at play during her term as CFO. While Sink may have played a role in increasing Florida's debt, it is not accurate to place sole blame on her without considering the broader economic context in which she served. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "The Republican Party of Florida has wasted no time launching attacks against Democrat Alex Sink, the former state CFO who just announced her run for the late C.W. Bill Young\u2019s congressional seat. There\u2019s a lot of different claims out there, most of which are summed up in a YouTube ad: \"As Florida\u2019s CFO, Alex Sink failed Florida taxpayers by using the state plane as her own personal charter, overseeing a $27 billion loss in the state\u2019s pension fund and supporting a $5.2 billion increase in Florida\u2019s debt.\" We\u2019ve already checked Sink\u2019s ties to the pension fund. In this fact-check, we\u2019ll look into her relationship to the Florida debt. First things first: We broke down the state debt level at the end of each fiscal year, according to a report by the Division of Bond Finance. Dollar figures are in billions. The GOP subtracted the 2006 number from the 2010 number, which does give us a difference of $5.2 billion. But since Sink took office in January 2007, the first budget she was in office for was fiscal year 2008, and the last would\u2019ve been 2011. When we take that difference, we get $3.4 billion. It\u2019s still a significant amount of debt, to be sure, but it\u2019s not quite as high as the ad made it out to be. As we\u2019ve noted in similar fact-checks, the implication here is that Sink in particular played a large role in increasing Florida\u2019s debt. As chief financial officer from 2007 to 2011, her duties included accounting, auditing and managing Florida\u2019s finances, in addition to serving on the State Board Administration with the governor and attorney general. In Florida, legislators are required to balance the budget each year, unlike in the federal government. But the state can issue bonds to pay for capital improvement projects like road improvements and the construction of educational facilities. A significant part of the debt during Sink's term was $1.9 billion in lottery revenue bonds to add class space to the state's schools, brought about by a 2002 amendment to the Florida Constitution that reduced class sizes. Additionally, while the CFO oversees finances, it's the state Legislature that passes a budget. \"It\u2019s the Legislature who decides how much bonding is going to be done,\" said Kurt Wenner, vice president for tax research at Florida TaxWatch, a business-backed institute focused on tax issues. The Cabinet and the governor sign off on the Division of Bond Finance\u2019s bond issues after the Legislature appropriates money for projects. The Cabinet consists of three members, including the the CFO, the attorney general and the commissioner of agriculture. Neither the Republican Party of Florida nor the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee could point us to an instance where Sink voted against issuing bonds. But approving the bond issues is business as usual for the governor and Cabinet, so it\u2019s routine for the vote to pass without disagreement. It is considered acceptable for the CFO to disagree with the governor on financial matters, said Susan MacManus, University of South Florida state government professor. But the fact that so many Cabinet and legislative officials (many of whom were Republicans) get a say in appropriations means the financial blame doesn\u2019t fall to Sink alone. \"You can\u2019t say that she has no responsibility for it,\" MacManus said. \"You could probably say that it\u2019s shared responsibility.\" The CFO also doesn\u2019t have the same veto power the governor does over bond appropriations, said Khi Thai, Florida Atlantic University public budgeting professor. \"Alex Sink can express her \u2018support\u2019 but cannot \u2018vote down\u2019 the Legislature's bond appropriations,\" Thai added. Aside from that distinction, it\u2019s worth remembering that the entire U.S. economy suffered during Sink\u2019s term as CFO, not just Florida. The state\u2019s trends of increasing debt are consistent with the nation\u2019s. Florida government, be it the Legislature or the Cabinet, shouldn\u2019t shoulder all the blame for a widespread recession."

    "claim": "Says under his utility rate plan, \"An estimated 50 percent of our residential households will see a decrease in their water and wastewater bills.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it is appropriate to label the claim as \"True\". The article states that \"an estimated 50 percent of our residential households will see a decrease in their water and wastewater bills\" under the proposed rate plan. This estimate is based on data provided by the Richmond Department of Public Utilities, which shows that 25,904 customers were billed for using 400 cubic feet or less each month in the 2012 fiscal year, which comes to about half of the city's residential customers. Additionally, the article notes that anyone charged for using 400 cubic feet or less would see lower bills under the new rate plan, with the biggest savings going to those who use the least water.\n\nFurthermore, the article acknowledges that the plan raises rates for the other half of households that billed monthly for using 500 cubic feet or more, but notes that these households will still see a decrease in their overall water and wastewater bills. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is true.",
    "doc": "Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones sees his plan to overhaul the city\u2019s water and wastewater rates as a glass half full. His plan cuts in half the base rates that all customers pay simply to have access to the city\u2019s water system. It also more than doubles a second charge to customers based on the amount of water they use and flush into the sewer system. \"Through this rate structure change, an estimated 50 percent of our residential households will see a decrease in their water and wastewater bills,\" Jones said in a March 12 news release announcing the plan. We wondered if the mayor was correct. Under his plan, the monthly base rate charged to all customers for water and wastewater service would drop from $49.40 to $26.11. Meanwhile, the second monthly payment based on the volume of water used would rise from $4.22 to $9.03 for every 100 cubic feet that comes into their taps or leaves their home as wastewater. That 100 cubic feet, listed as a \"ccf\" on a resident\u2019s water bill, amounts to about 750 gallons -- roughly 15 bathtubs full. The new rates are part of Jones\u2019 proposal for a Richmond budget that is scheduled for a City Council vote May 13. Jones said his rates are not aimed at generating more revenues but were designed to shift more of the burden of supporting the utility to the residents who use the most water. Tammy Hawley, a spokeswoman for the mayor, sent us a Department of Public Utilities chart breaking down the number of residential customers by their water use. The chart showed that 25,904 customers were billed for using 400 cubic feet or less each month in the 2012 fiscal year, the most recently completed budget cycle. That comes to about half of the city\u2019s 51,832 residential customers. Another chart Hawley sent shows that anyone charged for using 400 cubic feet or less would see lower bills. That\u2019s because the increase in their volume fee would be less than the savings they would get from the halving of the base rate. People right at that 400 cubic foot threshold now pay $66.28 a month. The new rates would drop their monthly bills to $62.23 -- a savings of $4.05. The less water they use, the greater their savings. For example, customers who use 200 cubic feet would save $13.67 each month. Their monthly bills, now $57.84, would drop to $44.17. City charts show that the biggest savers would be the 13.7 percent of customers who use \"0 ccf\" a month. That doesn\u2019t mean these households don\u2019t use water, just that they consumed less than the 750 gallons threshold necessary to trigger a volume charge, said Angela Fountain, a spokeswoman with the Richmond Department of Public Utilities. So these users, who only pay the base rate, would save $23.29 a month. But 750 gallons is precious little water to use in a month. Such a household would be limited daily to a 5-minute shower, one tooth brushing, one hand washing and several toilet flushes and monthly to two loads of laundry and several dish washings, according to estimates from the U.S. Geological Survey. We wondered if some of those households might be properties where no one is living but where someone still pays a water bill, such as a vacant apartment. Fountain said no one knows. \"If we\u2019re sending them a bill, then we believe the property is occupied, that someone is using water there,\" she said. \"We can\u2019t tell you how many people, how often they\u2019re there. We just don\u2019t have that information.\" So the mayor is correct that his plan cuts water and wastewater rates for half the city households. The unsaid part, of course, is that it raises rates for the other half -- those billed monthly for using 500 cubic feet or more. We should note that the average residential household uses 600 cubic feet in water and wastewater each month, according to Raftelis Financial Consultants, a group that examined the Richmond\u2019s utility pricing in a March 2013 report. Such customers will see their bill rise from $74.72 to $80.29 -- a $5.57 increase."

    "claim": "After the minimum wage for tipped workers was raised in Maine, the state \"reversed that decision due to restaurant employees organizing en masse against the measure.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "comparison",
    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The claim that \"After the minimum wage for tipped workers was raised in Maine, the state 'reversed that decision due to restaurant employees organizing en masse against the measure\"' is true based on the evidence provided. The article from the New York Times reports that after Maine passed a ballot initiative in 2016 to increase the minimum wage for tipped workers, restaurant workers organized campaigns to restore the lower wage for tipped workers due to fears that a higher wage would give patrons less incentive to leave tips. In response, the Maine legislature passed a new law in June 2017 making the minimum wage for tipped workers half of the regular minimum wage. This shows that restaurant employees did organize against the measure and led to a reversal of the decision to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers in Maine.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article supports this claim. Joshua Chaisson, a server in Portland, Maine, co-founded Restaurant Workers of America to oppose the wage increase and argued that individuals were coming into restaurants and asking servers if they still deserved the same tip percentage after the wage increase. Hundreds of restaurant owners and workers showed up at the state capitol in Maine for a public hearing on the wage increase, with some bringing pay stubs to demonstrate their loss of money due to the wage increase. Sen. Roger Katz gave credit to restaurant workers for the new law, stating that they had spoken and the legislature had listened.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that restaurant employees in Maine organized against the measure to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers and led to a reversal of the decision. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "New York state leaders are thinking about raising the minimum wage for workers who earn tips in addition to their hourly rate. Sen. James Tedisco, a Republican from Schenectady County, says that idea didn\u2019t work when it was tried in Maine two years ago. \"The state of Maine passed an initiative that abolished the tip credit,\" Tedisco wrote in a blog post, \"but less than a year later reversed that decision due to restaurant employees organizing en masse against the measure after they saw a significant decrease in earnings.\" The state Department of Labor will decide later this year whether to end a practice that allows employers to pay tipped employees less than the state\u2019s minimum wage. Tedisco is against the idea, saying it could do more harm than good for the state\u2019s restaurant industry. He says restaurant workers in Maine were able to reverse an identical proposal in their state. Is he right about what happened? What\u2019s happening in New York state The state Department of Labor is holding hearings across the state through June to consider raising the minimum wage for tipped workers. The proposal would not ban tipping. Tipped workers currently make between $7.50 and $10.85 an hour without tips depending on where they live and the industry they work in. The minimum wage for everyone else varies between $10.40 and $13.50 based on location and industry. Tips are meant to make up the difference between what tipped workers earn and the statewide minimum wage. Employers have to fill the gap if tips do not. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo believes the proposal may help employees who struggle to make the minimum wage with tips. If the Department of Labor agrees, the agency can raise the minimum wage for tipped employees without approval from voters or the state legislature. They already did once in 2015. What happened in Maine Maine tried to do the same thing in 2016 \u2014 sort of. In a 2016 ballot initiative, Maine approved increasing the state\u2019s minimum wage as well as gradually raising the minimum wage for tipped workers until it reached $12 in 2024. The measure passed by a slim margin. By the time the new minimum wage took effect at the start of 2017, restaurant workers had already organized a campaign to restore the lower wage for tipped workers. They argued that a higher wage would give patrons less incentive to leave a tip. Fear became reality for many workers, according to Joshua Chaisson, a server in Portland, Maine, who co-founded Restaurant Workers of America to opposethe wage increase. \"Individuals were coming into our restaurant and simply asking us, \u2018You make minimum wage, do you still think I should tip the same percentage?\u2019 \" Chaisson said. He was one of hundreds of restaurant owners and workers who showed up at the state capitol in Maine that April for a public hearing on the wage increase. \"Several of us had brought pay stubs forward from the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 showing we had actually lost money in the same identical quarter from year to year,\" Chaisson said. In June 2017, the Maine legislature passed a new law making theminimum wage for tipped workers half of the regular minimum wage. One of the bill's sponsors, Sen. Roger Katz, gave credit to restaurant workers for the new law. \"Hundreds of restaurant workers have spoken, and we have listened,\" Katz said in a statement. \"Over the session it has become abundantly clear that those working in the restaurant industry overwhelmingly favor the tip credit system.\""

    "justification": "The claim that the 2014-15 state budget \"cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs\" is incorrect based on the evidence provided. While there may have been a decrease in specific categories of spending for \"organized crime,\" \"border security,\" and \"local border security,\" the overall total for all-funds spending on border operations conducted under Texas Parks and Wildlife and Trusteded Programs in the Governor's Office, plus DPS \"border/local border\" categories, actually increased from $219.5 million in 2012-13 to $94.1 million in 2014-15, indicating a drop of $128.1 million. Additionally, the budget board staff estimated a total for border spending in all parts of DPS's budget of $331.2 million in the 2014-15 budget, which suggests an increase of $118.3 million over the agency's revised 2012-13 budget total of $212.9 million.\n\nFurthermore, the article states that Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, confirmed that according to Senate Finance Committee staff, border operations spending across all agencies in 2014-15 was $343.2 million, up $121.6 million from the previous budget. This suggests that there was actually an increase in funding for border security and fighting criminal gangs in the 2014-15 state budget.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that the 2014-15 state budget \"cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs\" is incorrect and should be labeled as Conflicting.",
    "doc": "In a video announcing his run for lieutenant governor June 27, 2013, state Sen. Dan Patrick said that border security is a federal responsibility but Texas\u2019 problem, and the state shouldn\u2019t budget less for it. \"This year\u2019s budget, despite increasing nearly 9 percent, actually cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs,\" the Houston Republican said. \"It was one of the reasons I voted against the budget.\" In a recent PolitiFact check, we found that state spending (aka general revenue) rose no more than 8.7 percent from 2012-13 to 2014-15. Did that include cuts to combating gangs and securing the border? Analysis showed us that wasn\u2019t exactly so -- in fact, budgeted border spending rose about $118 million. Border security has been a fiscal priority for Gov. Rick Perry, who has urged state efforts to supplement federal border operations starting in 2005. In 2010, he said those efforts had decreased border crime 60 percent, a claim we rated as Pants on Fire largely because its basis was crime in rural areas only, excluding towns and cities. Texas\u2019 border security efforts, according to an April 2013 issue brief from the Legislative Budget Board staff, began with state programs funded by federal grants in 2005-2007, followed by lawmakers signing off on $124 million in state spending from 2008-09 through 2012-13. State border operations are coordinated by the Governor's Office of Homeland Security within the Department of Public Safety, it said. The state created centers in the border area and Austin to gather intelligence, built a crime laboratory in Laredo, used software to map criminal activities in real time and coordinated federal, state, local and private law enforcement, the brief said, and also bought six aircraft, six patrol boats and 326 patrol vehicles. Patrick spokesman Logan Spence told us by email that Patrick\u2019s claim referred to three specific categories of DPS spending in the biennial budget: \"organized crime,\" \"border security\" and \"local border security.\" Spence emailed us summaries from the budget board, which advises lawmakers on state funding issues, giving the amounts appropriated for those categories in the past two budgets sent to Gov. Perry. The summaries, from Sept. 7, 2011, and May 20, 2013, showed all-funds spending, meaning state plus federal and other funds: \"Organized crime\" -- $17.4 million drop, from $134.6 million to $117.2 million. \"Border security\" plus \"local border security\" -- $6.1 million drop, from $89 million to $82.9 million. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us via email that those changes were attributable to funds being moved to different areas within the department, plus \"one-time big ticket items\" under border spending and revised estimates for items such as federal grants in the \"organized crime\" spending. Spence had also sent us budget board summaries that wrapped in border operations conducted under Texas Parks and Wildlife and Trusteed Programs in the Governor\u2019s Office. Those summaries, from May 2011 and June 2013, indicated that all-funds border security spending in those programs plus the DPS \"border/\"local border\" categories went from $219.5 million in 2012-13 to $94.1 million in 2014-15 -- indicating a drop of $128.1 million. Then again, the June 2013 summary also said \"additional funding is provided\" to DPS for border security above the $94.1 million total. Including that unspecified spending, the budget allocates more than $100 million to border security operations not spelled out in those estimates, we heard from a chief budget-writer and the staff of the board that advises lawmakers on spending issues Budget board staff spokesman John Barton told us via phone that by July 15, 2013, the board had estimated a total for border spending in all parts of DPS\u2019 budget: $331.2 million in the 2014-15 budget. That total suggests an increase of $118.3 million over the agency\u2019s revised 2012-13 border security budget total of $212.9 million. Vinger confirmed the amounts in the July 15 estimate were budgeted for DPS, offering no further comment. For another legislative perspective, we contacted a spokesman for Senate Finance Committee chairman Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands. Via email, Gary Scharrer asserted that as a committee member, Patrick would have known the wider scope of border spending and could have requested such numbers before his June campaign announcement. Scharrer said via email that according to Senate Finance Committee staff, border operations spending across all agencies in 2014-15 was $343.2 million, up $121.6 million from the previous budget. We weren\u2019t able to learn what date that estimate was produced, but Scharrer said Patrick would have been aware that such spending was going into the budget. \"He would have been in the loop on border security budget discussions,\" Scharrer said. Noting the Senate gave the budget act its final approval on May 25, Scharrer said, \"The numbers were available\" to Patrick. \"Sen. Patrick could have checked with LBB or DPS for clarification \u2013 or verification \u2013 before going public. Many members fact-check ahead of time,\" Scharrer said, adding with a note of humor that they do so \"to save themselves from PolitiFact sweeping in after them.\" As to budgeted money to battle criminal gangs, Barton told us DPS\u2019s \"organized crime\" category was not the only state money spent to fight gangs. However, he said, the budget board did not have an estimate of such a 2014-15 total. Spence said he stood by the information he sent us. \"People read those summaries and rely on those summaries as accurate data from the Legislative Budget Board,\" he said. Asked about the budget board staff\u2019s July 15 estimate of $331.2 million border spending in DPS for 2014-15, Spence said, \"I think there\u2019s a disagreement about what is border security spending.\" Citing a couple of items mentioned in the July 15 estimate, Spence said, \"A raise for troopers is not border security spending. Police academies and all those things... If the budget says \u2018Border security spending is this,\u2019 then members of the committee and members of the Senate are going to rely on that.\" Barton said all items in the estimate relate directly to border security. For instance, he said, the nearly $75 million in listed pay raises reflects money going to officers involved in border operations."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim \"\"Sixty percent of the auto thefts that we have in (St. Petersburg) are caused by people leaving their keys in the car\"\" is true. The article cites data from the Police Department, which states that out of the 551 cars stolen so far this year, 460 of them had keys either in the ignition or elsewhere in the vehicle, which accounts for an alarming 83.4 percent of total thefts. This suggests that a significant proportion of auto thefts in St. Petersburg are indeed caused by people leaving their keys in the car, thereby providing evidence to support the claim.\nMoreover, the article quotes Police Chief Chuck Harmon as saying that over the past decade, there has been a 70 percent drop in auto thefts in St. Petersburg due to advances in car technology, which have made vehicles harder to steal with screwdrivers and other tools. However, this has led to an increase in crimes of opportunity, such as thefts caused by people leaving their keys in their cars. The article notes that 96 percent of stolen cars are recovered later where the thief ran out of gas, indicating that most area offenders are not trying to bring cars to chop shops or resell high-end models, but rather capitalizing on careless driver mistakes.\nFinally, the article highlights that it is technically illegal to leave one's car unattended and running, which further underscores the importance of locking one's cars and avoiding such careless mistakes.\nBased on these points, it is clear that the claim \"\"Sixty percent of the auto thefts that we have in (St. Petersburg) are caused by people leaving their keys in the car\"\" is well-supported by the evidence provided in the article. Therefore, the label \"\"True\"\" is an appropriate designation for this claim.",
    "doc": "St. Petersburg Mayor Bill Foster interrupted last week's mayoral forum with an important public service announcement: Don't leave your keys in the car. No, really. The plea came in the middle of a discussion on crime, with Foster noting that good police work can't overcome people's lack of common sense. \"Sixty percent of the auto thefts that we have in the city are caused by people leaving their keys in the car,\" Foster said. The problem is so bad, city officials say, that the Police Department created a sassily named mascot Willie Everlern to help spread the message to residents. In a black-and-white video, Everlern is shocked to discover that his car was heisted after he left the keys inside while he walked into a convenience store. We wondered if the situation in St. Petersburg can actually be this bad. Lo and behold, it\u2019s worse. Out of the 551 cars stolen so far this year, 460 of them had keys either in the ignition or elsewhere in the vehicle, Police Chief Chuck Harmon said. That\u2019s 83.4 percent. \"If I were a car thief, I\u2019d move to St. Petersburg,\" said Frank Scafidi, spokesman for the National Insurance Crime Bureau, when told of the numbers. Scafidi said the percentage might be a \"high-water mark\" in the country. Over the past several years, car technology has made vehicles harder to steal with screwdrivers and other tools. Many new cars have transponder keys, which means someone can\u2019t unlock or start the car unless the key fob is close to the vehicle. As a result, St. Petersburg has seen a 70 percent drop in auto thefts over the past decade, Harmon said. As a result, people leaving their keys in their cars has become an increasing source of car thefts in the city. The thefts are crimes of opportunity, so 96 percent of cars are recovered later where the thief ran out of gas. Most area offenders are not trying to bring cars to chop shops or resell high-end models. People are just capitalizing on careless driver mistakes. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 40 to 50 percent of auto thefts nationwide are due to keys in the car. Just lock your cars, people. As Harmon said, \"It\u2019s not rocket science.\" One other note: It\u2019s technically illegal to leave your car unattended and running. So not only do you run the risk of having your car stolen, the police could issue you a ticket."

    "claim": "Roy Blunt \"voted to raise his own pay 12 times\" while in Congress.",

    "justification": "The claim that Roy Blunt \"voted to raise his own pay 12 times\" in Congress is accurate based on the provided evidence. According to the Congressional Research Service, members of Congress receive an automatic pay increase each year based on private-sector wage changes unless denied by a congressional statute. Blunt voted against measures to stop these automatic pay increases, which resulted in his pay increasing along with other members of Congress.\n\nThe evidence provided shows that Blunt voted in favor of the 1997 Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill, which included an automatic pay increase for members of Congress. This vote was taken before Blunt had been in Congress for five consecutive years, during which time the previous Congress had voted to not adjust their pay. Blunt also voted against measures to stop the yearly pay adjustment from occurring in 1999 through 2007, resulting in his pay increasing each year along with other members of Congress. In 2010, Blunt voted in favor of a bill that froze the pay of some federal civilian employees for two years, which could be seen as a vote to protect Congressional pay increases.\n\nWhile Blunt did not directly vote to increase his own pay 12 times, his votes against measures to stop the automatic pay increases contributed to his pay increasing each year during his time in Congress. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "Jason Kander, a Democrat running against Republican Roy Blunt for one of Missouri\u2019s U.S. Senate seats, says his opponent \"voted to raise his own pay 12 times\" while in Congress. What are the facts behind this claim? Kander provides sources in this document on his website and even provides quotations from the Congressional Research Service. But providing a source doesn\u2019t necessarily make a claim factual. So we took a deeper look into the legislation itself, and how congressional pay raises occur. In 1989, Congress approved an annual cost-of-living adjustment to member\u2019s pay as part of an ethics reform bill. The yearly adjustment percentage is based on private-sector wage changes and is applied automatically unless denied by a congressional statute. This created a system in which members of Congress can receive pay raises without explicitly voting for them on the record. What Blunt did was vote against measures to stop the yearly pay adjustment from occurring. Each of the times Blunt is alleged to have increased his pay came between 1997 and 2010, when Blunt was still a member of the House of Representatives for Missouri\u2019s 7th District. Here\u2019s how it breaks down year by year. 1997 Blunt\u2019s first year in Washington was preceded by five consecutive years of Congress voting to not adjust their pay, but that streak would not continue. The Senate and House versions of the 1998 Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill (S. 1023 and H.R. 2378, respectively) differed on the inclusion of a pay freeze, with the Senate version supporting no raise. The two chambers agreed to a conference to iron out the differences, with the House voting 229-199 to \"order the previous question,\" which is legalese for ending debate and bringing the measure to an immediate vote. The vote, which Blunt supported, meant that no pay freeze could be added to the bill and sent H.R. 2378 to conference without instructions to stop the automatic pay increase. This led to the Senate wording being dropped from the final bill, which was signed into law on Oct. 10, 1997. Members of Congress\u2019 pay increased 2.3 percent to $136,700. On Oct. 2, 1997, Blunt told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \"I believe keeping the current salary of Congress equal with the rate of inflation is the right thing, and a necessary thing to do to be able to attract people to seek congressional office in the future.\" 1999 through 2007 From 1999 through 2007, similar actions to those in 1997 were taken in the House to order the previous question before an amendment to stop the pay increase could be proposed. For some of these years, the Congressional Research Service said \"it cannot be said with any degree of certainty that Members would have voted to deny a pay increase if they had been given an opportunity,\" as amendments other than the pay freeze were suggested before the House voted to order the previous question. Some years, however, Representatives made clear their intention to introduce a pay freeze before the vote to order the previous question was taken. Every year from 1999 through 2007, Blunt voted in favor of ordering the previous question. As a result of the automatic increases, the pay of members of Congress increased from $136,700 in 1999 to $169,300 at the start of 2008. 2009 On Feb. 25, 2009, the House voted to add a provision to an omnibus appropriations act that would prohibit the automatic pay adjustment for 2010. Blunt was one of only 24 members of the House to oppose this, with 398 members voting in favor of it. Blunt also voted against the omnibus appropriations act as a whole, but this time was joined by 178 members of the House, with 245 members voting in favor of it. As a result, congressional salaries, including Blunt\u2019s, did not increase. 2010 Well into the recession, bills were being proposed to stop pay adjustments for 2011, instead of just tacking the legislation on as an amendment to a larger bill. Blunt voted in favor of one of these bills, which passed the House 402-15 and went on to become law. So Blunt actually voted against the automatic pay increase in 2010. The vote Kander claims is a vote to increase Blunt\u2019s pay this year comes from the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, which froze the pay of some federal civilian employees for two years. While this isn\u2019t a direct vote on his own pay, the 1989 ethics reform bill, which began the automatic pay increases for members of Congress, specifies that their pay cannot be increased by a higher percentage in a year than that of general schedule employees. So a vote against this could be seen as a vote to protect Congressional pay increases, though it may be even more of a stretch than Kander\u2019s prior claims. While Blunt actually voted in favor of this bill when it was passed in the House 415-3, Kander points to Blunt\u2019s vote against the conference bill, which resolved the differences between the House\u2019s and Senate\u2019s versions of the bill as a vote to increase his own pay. This final version of the bill passed the house 193-165 on Dec. 21, 2010."

    "claim": "Says Chris Christie fired 6,000 teachers.",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",

    "justification": "The claim that Chris Christie fired 6,000 teachers is conflicting, as the evidence provided suggests that the number of teachers laid off or retired due to budget cuts was significantly lower than 6,000. According to the New Jersey Education Department, the number of teachers fell by about 4,500 between 2007 and 2010, which is less than half of the claimed amount. Moreover, Steve Wollmer, director of communications for the New Jersey Education Association, clarified that the term \"firing\" is inaccurate, as layoffs and retirements due to budget cuts were more common than firings. Gordon MacInnes, a former Democratic lawmaker, also highlighted that two factors contributed to the reduction in teachers: Christie's proposed deep reductions in aid, which led to local school boards attempting to fill the gap with property tax hikes that were rejected by voters, and the loss of stimulus dollars. Bruce Baker, a professor of education at Rutgers, agreed that funding cuts led to staffing reductions but emphasized the difficulty in determining the share of reductions due to \"reduction in force\" policies invoked by local public school districts claiming fiscal stress. Based on the evidence provided, it is unclear where the claim of firing 6,000 teachers originated from and how reliable it is. Therefore, the label Conflicting is appropriate.",
    "doc": "New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie might have won re-election with plenty of votes from Democrats (a stunning third of voters from the other party marked their ballots for him, according to exit polls), but he got no love from a major Democratic constituency: teachers and people who identify with their cause. MSNBC host Ed Schultz puts himself in the teachers\u2019 camp. On his election day show, Schultz said Christie is far more conservative than the moderate image that swirls around him. Case in point? The governor\u2019s education policy. \"All of a sudden, he is the self-anointed expert on education in America, and he has all the answers,\" Schultz said. \"Cut a billion dollars out of the system, fire 6,000 teachers, and just tell everybody I'm an expert.\" Did Christie\u2019s policy lead to the firing of 6,000 teachers? We decided to dig a little. We reached out the Ed Schultz Show and didn\u2019t hear back, but the state count of teachers undercuts the claim. Christie took office in 2010. Over the next two years, the number of teachers fell by about 4,500. Year Number of teachers Change from year before 2007 110,964 2008 111,786 822 2009 114,450 2,664 2010 114,704 254 2011 110,301 -4,403 2012 110,229 -72 Source: New Jersey Education Dept. Now, while 4,500 is less than 6,000, it\u2019s still a lot of teachers, and Schultz could claim that he was in the ballpark. Except we know that not all those teachers were fired. \" 'Firing' is an incorrect term,\" said Steve Wollmer, director of communications for the New Jersey Education Association. Wollmer said Christie backed a budget cut of $1.3 billion for schools. It produced a mix of layoffs and retirements. Wollmer said layoffs were more common than retirements, but he said he has no hard data on how many people fell into each group. Plus, the cuts led to reductions in the ranks of both teachers and support staff. Wollmer lumps both groups together. \"I\u2019m more than comfortable saying Christie was responsible for over 6,000 layoffs, due to his cuts,\" Wolmer said. But that raises another wrinkle in the story. We need to assess whether responsibility for the loss of teachers rest solely on Christie\u2019s shoulders. Gordon MacInnes, a former Democratic lawmaker and now head of a left-leaning think tank, New Jersey Policy Perspective, said two things happened after Christie took office. \"Christie and the Democratic Legislature cut $1 billion in state funds from school aid and the stimulus aid expired,\" MacInnes said. A multi-billion dollar state budget deficit made 2010 a very contentious year for school funding. Christie proposed deep reductions in aid, and local school boards tried to fill the gap with property tax hikes. Then local voters shot down those plans in record numbers. Those local decisions complicate the picture, \"Yes, funding cuts do appear in many cases to have led to staffing reductions,\" said Bruce Baker, professor of education at Rutgers. \"But I'm not sure of a good data source you could use to identify what share of those reductions were from \u2018reduction in force\u2019 policies invoked by local public school districts claiming fiscal stress.\" On the other hand, as a deadline loomed for passage of a state budget, Christie refused concessions to the Democratic-controlled Legislature and the state\u2019s smallest budget in five years passed with a minimum of Democratic support. The initial cuts were so deep, a judge reversed a portion of them. The loss of stimulus dollars also played a major role. According to the federal government website, Recovery.gov, New Jersey received over $1.6 billion in one-time education grants through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. In April 2010, Christie\u2019s administration said schools needed to manage a slightly smaller loss of about $1 billion in stimulus funds but in either case, schools were losing a significant amount of money due to the end of the federal program. Overall, Christie gets a fair degree of responsibility for the school funding cuts, although the way those cuts translated into reductions in staff might be indirect."

    "doc": "Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee questioned the motives and origins of \"so-called \u2018Syrian refugees\u2019 \" during the Nov. 10 undercard GOP debate. While Huckabee, a former pastor, says he\u2019s concerned about the plight of Christians in the region, he dismissed the idea of the United States accepting whoever \u2014as he put it \u2014wants free sandwiches and health care. \"We have no idea who these people are. What we do know is only one out of five of the so-called \u2018Syrian refugees\u2019 who went into Europe were actually Syrian,\" Huckabee said. \"Are we going to open the door so ISIS people can come on in, and we\u2019ll give them a place to stay and a good sandwich and medical benefits?\" We were curious about Huckabee\u2019s claim that the majority of the refugees don\u2019t come from Syria. Huckabee\u2019s spokesperson Hogan Gidley told us his source was the Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s official statistical agency. He also forwarded us an article in the Daily Mail that said \"four out of five migrants are NOT from Syria.\" (The article\u2019s findings were repeated by some conservative American media outlets.) We found that the Daily Mail\u2019s and Huckabee\u2019s statistic represents the situation in the three months before the Syrian migrants actually began arriving in Europe in bulk. Looking at the whole picture, asylum seekers from Syria represent half of all refugees. According to the Daily Mail, the European Union \"logged 213,000 arrivals in April, May and June but only 44,000 of them were fleeing the Syrian civil war.\" Those figures are lifted from Eurostat\u2019s latest asylum quarterly report. But the Daily Mail\u2019s use of data is flawed, and Huckabee\u2019s extrapolation even more so. First, the four out of five non-Syrian migrants are not falsely claiming to be Syrian as Huckabee\u2019s phrasing \u2014 \"so-called Syrian refugees\" \u2014 suggests. There is anecdotal evidence of people using fake or stolen passports, but the refugees in Eurostat\u2019s tally hail from other countries that are experiencing or recovering from conflict, like Afghanistan, Albania, Iraq and Kosovo. The Guardianexplains why this distorts the refugee situation: \"If you lump this group in with those who crossed the Mediterranean to claim asylum, the number of Syrians will naturally seem smaller. But this is to conflate two largely separate phenomena: the Mediterranean crisis and internal migration between different European states.\" (Huckabee\u2019s point was that media reports conflated the the Syrian refugees and those who were not, Gidley told us.) And last and most importantly, the 44,000 figure only represents a three-month period. This is \"particularly problematic\" as the largest spike in Syrian arrivals occurred after June, pointed out the Guardian. Here\u2019s a chart with data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\u2019 Syria page to that point: If we look at all of 2015, Syrian refugees account for 52 percent of nearly 800,000 Mediterranean sea arrivals, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Afghanistan and Iraq were the next two top countries of origin of refugees, accounting for 19 percent and 6 percent of refugees respectively."

The table indicates 588 Texans were killed in action from Oct. 1, 2011, to Jan. 24, 2013. It was prepared by the Defense Manpower Data Center, which is the Department of Defense\u2019s \"human resource information source.\"Some 310 of the Texans were married when they died, the table indicates, while 253 were not married; 24 were divorced; and one had an unknown marital status.By email, Nichols noted that Van de Putte generally focused in her remarks on Texas members of the armed services killed in action with surviving spouses in the state who might benefit from her proposed constitutional amendment, which cleared the Senate and awaits House consideration. Under the proposal, which also would require voter approval to take effect, spouses who have not remarried could be exempt from paying property taxes on their homesteads.Shortly after declaring the 250 figure, Nichols stressed, Van de Putte clarified by saying: \"So we\u2019re talking probably about 250 folks who would even qualify for this, and that\u2019s since 9/11.\"Nichols said Van de Putte gave the incorrect figure due to staff error. By telephone, Bill Wilson, chief of staff for the Senate committee, told us that as Van de Putte spoke, he gave her the 250 figure by drawing from the wrong column on the table. His intent, he said, was to let her know that 310 of the Texans killed in action since 9/11 were married, which is of relevance to the fiscal impact of her proposal.Finally, Defense Department spokeswoman Leslie Hull-Ryde guided us to up-to-date online counts of Americans killed in action, enabling us to confirm that as of May 2, 2013, 588 Texans had been killed in action since Oct. 1, 2011.

While it is true that the national debt increased during Obama's presidency, the amount added was not greater than the level on the day he took office.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article supports this conclusion. According to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, the estimated amount of debt held by the public at the end of fiscal year 2013 was $12.636 trillion. Based on this estimate, the amount of debt held by the public added during Obama's tenure would be about $6.329 trillion, surpassing the amount as of his inauguration by about $22 billion. However, this figure does not represent the total debt, which is estimated to increase to $17.5 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2013.\n\nIt is important to note that both Presidents Bush and Obama have contributed to the debt increases over the last decade through tax cuts, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, stimulus bills, and other spending initiatives. Therefore, it is not accurate to blame Obama alone for the increased national debt during his presidency.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim. The claim suggests that President Obama added a large amount of debt to the national economy, but the evidence shows that while the debt did increase during his presidency, it was not greater than the level on the day he took office.",
    "doc": "UPDATE: A more recent version of a similar claim is available here. When it comes to increasing the national debt, President Barack Obama has done more than his 43 predecessors combined.Well, at least that\u2019s according to a chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey, echoing a claim made to varying degrees by different Republican officials in recent years. With the subject line \"A picture is worth 1,000 words,\" the chain e-mail features a graphic to make its case.Above pictures of Presidents George Washington and George W. Bush, one side of the graphic reads \"Debt Added By The Previous 43 U.S. PRESIDENTS COMBINED --- 1789 through 2008.\" Beneath the presidents\u2019 photos is \"$6.3 TRILLION DOLLARS.\"On the other side of the graphic is a photo of a smiling Obama, beneath the words \"Debt Added By PRESIDENT OBAMA --- One Term!\" The amount listed below the photo is \"$6.5 TRILLION DOLLARS.\"A picture may be worth 1,000 words, but the wording of this chain e-mail makes for a largely inaccurate claim.The main problem is the chain e-mail suggests that Obama already has \"added\" $6.5 trillion to the national debt. His administration is on track to add nearly that amount to one form of debt by October 2013, but the president has not added that much debt yet.First, let\u2019s explain the two commonly cited forms of national debt -- debt held by the public and total debt.The debt held by the public refers to money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public as well as money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare. On Jan. 20, 2009, the date of Obama's inauguration, the debt held by the public -- as accrued by Obama\u2019s predecessors -- stood at roughly $6.307 trillion and the total debt was about $10.6 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s \"Debt to the Penny\" calculator. Since the amount listed for Obama's predecessors in the chain e-mail appears to be in reference to the $6.307 trillion in debt held by the public on Jan. 20, 2009, that's the starting point for our analysis. Next, we'll show how much both forms of debt had increased as of April 27, 2012 -- the last date available at the time we received the chain e-mail.By that date, the debt held by the public was about $10.8 trillion and total debt had climbed to roughly $15.6 trillion.So, under Obama\u2019s watch, debt held by the public had increased by about $4.5 trillion, or roughly 72 percent. Total debt had increased by nearly $5 trillion, or about 47 percent.By either form of debt, the amounts added during Obama\u2019s administration were not greater than the levels on the day he took office.Now, let\u2019s explain one way that this chain e-mail could be considered accurate.If we take into account administration projections for debt held by the public as of the end of fiscal year 2013, then the amount of that debt added would exceed the level from Jan. 20, 2009. Fiscal year 2013 is the last budget year to begin during Obama\u2019s first term.According to the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, debt held by the public is estimated to be about $12.636 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2013, which concludes Sept. 30, 2013.Based on that estimate, the amount of debt held by the public that was added during Obama\u2019s tenure would be about $6.329 trillion, surpassing the amount as of his inauguration by about $22 billion.In terms of total debt -- projected to increase to $17.5 trillion -- the amount added by the end of fiscal year 2013 would still not exceed the total amount on Jan. 20, 2009. Before we get to our ruling, it's worth noting that actions taken by both Presidents Bush and Obama have contributed to the debt increases over the last decade. Those factors include tax cuts enacted under Bush and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, both of which were started by the Bush administration, as well as the stimulus bill and another tax cut deal approved by Obama. Experts also have pointed to the weak economy as a contributing factor to the higher debt, given the reduction in federal revenues and greater spending on items like unemployment benefits."

    "doc": "Dave Brat\u2019s surprise primary win over House Majority Leader Eric Cantor didn\u2019t just knock out a potential successor to Speaker John Boehner. Because Cantor was Jewish, the lone voice for religious diversity in the GOP\u2019s congressional ranks will also disappear, argued Bill Maher, host of HBO\u2019s Real Time. \"Now there are no non-Christian Republicans. This is an amazing fact,\" Maher said June 13. \"There are 278 Republicans in Congress. They are now all Christian and all white except for one black senator who was appointed. So this is an entirely Christian, white party.\" Does Cantor\u2019s primary defeat mean Republicans in Congress are now all white and all Christian? Republicans \u2018all Christian\u2019 The 2012 elections ushered in the first Buddhist in the Senate (Hawaii\u2019s Mazie Hirono, a Democrat), the first Hindu in either chamber (Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat), and the first Congress member to list her religious affiliation as \"none\" (Arizona Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat), according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, which recorded the religious affiliation of members for a 2012 report. They joined two Muslims (Democrats) and a Unitarian Universalist (a Democrat). When it comes to Republicans, 192 of 278 GOP members identify with a Protestant denomination (Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, etc.), 70 identify as Catholic, three are Orthodox Christian, and 12 are Mormon (more on that in a moment). Cantor, a Republican from Virginia, is Jewish and makes No. 278, but Brat, the Republican who could succeed him after the November election, is Catholic. The only possible hang-up to Maher\u2019s claim when examining the current makeup of Congress when it comes to religion is how you view Mormonism. Some Christians do not recognize Mormons, belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as Christians. Mormonsdo consider themselves Christians. Republicans \u2018all white\u2019 Maher also said the GOP\u2019s congressional ranks are all-white except for one appointed African-American official. That\u2019s Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who resigned his House seat for a Senate appointment in January 2013. To say the other Republicans in Congress are all white depends on your definition of \"all white,\" which isn\u2019t always so easy to define. There are no other African-American Republicans in Congress (there are 43 black Democrats). There also are no Asian or Pacific Islander Republicans in Congress (there are 13 Democrats). But there are three Hispanic Republican senators and seven Hispanic Republicans in the House, according to the Congressional Research Service. That includes Cuban-American Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Florida Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, and Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, born in Puerto Rico. The Census Bureau, however, does not include Hispanic or Latino as a racial designation, instead using the categories white, black, Asian, Pacific Islander and American Indian. The Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnicity, which is based on cultural or linguisticsimilarity. Hispanics could identify with any race depending on the region from where they descend, or list none at all. Pew says as many as 6.2 percent of census respondents selected \"some other race\" in the 2010 census, the vast majority of whom were Hispanic. And there is a movement to include Hispanic as a racial category in future censuses, says Kevin Dougherty, Baylor University sociology professor. \"To say they are all white, you think they have very fair skin and have European descent,\" Dougherty said. \"It does mask an important source of diversity that is present among Republicans in Congress.\" It\u2019s not just Hispanics who are unaccounted for in Maher\u2019s claim. We know of two Republicans that are enrolled members of federally recognized American Indian tribes. The first is Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who is a member of the Chickasaw Nation tribe. The second is freshman Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., a citizen of the Cherokee Nation. The timeline of all this One more critical point: When Maher says the Republicans in Congress are \"now\" all white and all Christian, that\u2019s not accurate -- Cantor isn\u2019t going anywhere yet. The GOP\u2019s lone Jewish member will not leave until his replacement is sworn into office in early 2015, after the midterm elections. And as he leaves office, it\u2019s possible that new non-white, non-Christian Republicans could take seats in Congress. There are several possibilities: Mia Love, a Republican African-American running for Congress in Utah, is afar-and-awayfavorite to win a seat in the U.S. House come November. Will Hurd, an African-American Republican, secured the GOP nomination in Texas\u2019 most-competitive House district (which backed Mitt Romney for president in 2012). T.W. Shannon, an African-American Republican, has the support of Texas\u2019 Cruz in Shannon\u2019s bid for an Oklahoma Senate seat. (His primary is June 24.) A Jewish Republican and state lawmaker, Adam Kwasman, is running in the Republican primary in Arizona\u2019s 1st Congressional District."

    "doc": "A theme is emerging in New Jersey\u2019s U.S. Senate race: opponents blaming one another for bloating government debt.Republican challenger state Sen. Joe Kyrillos has tied U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez to growth in the national debt and deficits. In an interview on NJTV\u2019s \"On the Record\" that aired June 8, Menendez, a Democrat, responded to those charges.\"Well first of all, evidently my Republican opponent has selective memory,\" Menendez said, first citing growth in state debt under Kyrillos\u2019 watch.Then, Menendez said: \"Here's someone who raided the state's -- voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money.\"Kyrillos helped pushed through a controversial plan in 1997 from then-Gov. Christie Whitman to sell nearly $2.8 billion in bonds in a bid to cover unfunded liabilities in the state\u2019s pension system.To be clear, we are not ruling on whether the pension bonds were sound fiscal policy. We are also not ruling on Whitman\u2019s overall impact on the pension system. We\u2019re looking at two, specific claims: whether voting for the bonds constituted a $2.8 billion raid on the pension system and whether they are costing taxpayers $15 billion to pay off.Both statements veer from the truth, PolitiFact New Jersey found.The bond legislation -- approved on June 5, 1997, with Kyrillos voting in favor of it -- authorized the state\u2019s Economic Development Authority to sell $2.75 billion in bonds, the proceeds of which were deposited in state retirement funds for public workers.A separate, companion bill changed accounting rules for the pension system and allowed the state and local employers to reduce their normal contributions by the amount of surplus in the funds.The move allowed Whitman to avoid making nearly $600 million in payments into the pension system that year, which helped balance her budget.Melissa Castro, a spokeswoman for the Menendez campaign, said \"skipping scheduled payments into the pension system is a raid of pension funds, because by definition, it is reducing the total funds available to pay the funds' obligations.\"Whitman skipped payments that year -- as she did in others -- but she put nearly $2.8 billion of borrowed money in the funds. That does not fit the definition of a raid.Now, what\u2019s the final price tag for those pension bonds, which mature in 2029?Menendez put the tab at nearly $15 billion. According to the state Treasury Department, the bonds -- which the state is paying more than 7 percent interest on -- will cost $10.1 billion to pay off. The general fund shoulders the burden of the bond payments, not the pension system.Treasury Department spokesman Andy Pratt said it\u2019s unfair to look at the expense of the bonds without also considering the investment interest the money is earning. The average rate of return has been 6.36 percent a year, Pratt said.Ultimately, the state\u2019s general fund is still on the hook for $10.1 billion. In the upcoming budget, debt service on the bonds will cost nearly $300 million.Castro said whether it was $15 billion or $10 billion, Menendez is still correct on his fundamental point. \"Nevertheless this is still bad fiscal policy,\" she said."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, it is clear that President Obama was correct when he said that \"a million people\" in Texas could get health insurance immediately if the state expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. The Urban Institute estimates that almost 1.4 million Texans would become eligible for Medicaid if the state opted to expand, and the state agency report suggests that under both scenarios (with and without Medicaid expansion), a significant number of uninsured Texans would gain coverage. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.\n\nThe evidence provided supports the idea that a significant number of people in Texas are currently uninsured, and that expanding Medicaid under Obamacare could provide them with access to health insurance. President Obama's statement reflects this reality, as he is citing the potential for millions of Texans to gain coverage immediately if the state chose to accept the federal dollars available for expansion.\n\nFurthermore, the estimate of 1.7 million newly eligible uninsured adults living in Texas alone supports the claim that a million people could get health insurance right away. This number represents a significant portion of the total uninsured population in Texas and highlights the potential impact of Medicaid expansion on improving access to healthcare for low-income individuals and families.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that President Obama's claim that \"a million people\" in Texas could get health insurance immediately if the state expanded Medicaid under Obamacare is accurate. The available data supports this claim, and it is reasonable to assume that a significant number of uninsured Texans would gain coverage if the state chose to expand Medicaid. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "Visiting Dallas on Nov. 6, 2013, President Barack Obama sought to allay worries about his signature health-care law and assert Texans\u2019 need for more health coverage. Texas could have helped many immediately, he said, by accepting the law\u2019s offer of federal dollars to help pay for expanding Medicaid, a key Obamacare initiative. \"Across this state, you've got a million people -- because this is a big state -- a million people, citizens, who don\u2019t have health insurance that could get health insurance right away if the state of Texas decided to take advantage of it,\" Obama said at Temple Emanu-El to volunteers who helped people enroll via the act\u2019s insurance marketplace on Healthcare.gov. Texas consistently has the nation\u2019s highest percentage of residents without health insurance. The Census Bureau estimated 6.4 million Texans in 2012 had no health coverage. The state Health and Human Services Commission estimated that in January 2013, Texas had about 1 million adults on Medicaid. Under the health care law, the federal government offered to pay expansion costs during the first three years for states that extended Medicaid to adults earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Texas Gov. Rick Perry rejected that deal July 19, 2012. Medicaid is a federal-state insurance program that targets children and low-income families, elderly and disabled people, pregnant women and children in foster care. Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the state commission, which administers Medicaid in Texas, told us by email, \"We estimate that almost 1.4 million Texans would become eligible for Medicaid if the state opted to expand.\" The Urban Institute, a non-partisan research institute in Washington, D.C., reached a slightly larger figure in a July 2012 report that said, \"State decisions regarding whether to expand Medicaid under the ACA will directly affect the 15.1 million uninsured adults with incomes below 138 percent of FPL (federal poverty level) who are not currently eligible for Medicaid. Of these newly eligible uninsured adults ... 1.7 million live in Texas.\" The institute said its estimates were made using data from the Census Bureau\u2019s 2010 American Community Survey. In a March 18, 2013, report, the state agency contrasted how Texas\u2019 uninsured population might differ in two different Obamacare scenarios using Current Population Survey census data from March 2012. \"Current state\" populations included 19.5 million insured and 6 million uninsured (24 percent uninsured), the report said. The implementation of Obamacare alone, without Medicaid expansion in Texas, would shift that rate to 16 percent uninsured (4.2 million Texans), the agency estimated. Under Obamacare implementation with full Medicaid expansion, 12 percent (3.1 million Texans) would remain uninsured. Not all the newly eligible adults would be expected to sign up immediately, Goodman said, citing 2012 estimates from the agency that show Medicaid adult enrollment rising by 341,000 in 2014, by 776,000 in 2015 and by just over 1 million in 2016:"

    "doc": "As a longtime gun owner, New Hampshire Republican Jim Rubens made his support for Second Amendment rights one of the early themes of his campaign for U.S. Senate. Rubens launched a \"2nd Amendment Protection Tour\" earlier this year, traveling to gun shops around the state to pledge his support for firearms owners. It was a move that invited comparisons between himself and the man he views as his strongest challenger in the GOP primary, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown. Brown has voiced support for increased gun control after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., and has since faced blowback from gun owners in New Hampshire. During a stop at Lee\u2019s Gun Shop in Hudson, Rubens said he would oppose a ban on assault weapons or high-capacity magazines if voters send him to Washington to replace Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Rubens also provided recommendations to address gun violence and mass shootings, such as encouraging schools to hire armed security personnel. The presence of armed civilians would send the message that shooters won\u2019t achieve their aims, he said. \"In mass shooting incidents where you had a person inside the premises during the incident, you have an average of 2.5 people killed if there is someone with a firearm able to stop the crime in progress,\" he said. \"In similar instances where there\u2019s no such person with a firearm, you have an average of 18 people killed and dead as a result of it.\" This seemed like a sharp contrast, so we asked Rubens to back up his claim about shooting deaths. His campaign pointed us to an article by Davi Barker, who runs a website called Daily Anarchist. In July 2012, Barker wrote that he studied several mass shootings and determined the average number of people killed in mass shootings when the shooter is stopped by police is 18.25. \"I based it on 10 shootings I found listed on some timeline somewhere,\" he wrote. \"I honestly don\u2019t even remember where.\" Barker was challenged when he posted these statistics on Facebook, leading him to conduct a more thorough study, according to his website. After reviewing 100 \"rampage shooting\" incidents, Barker revised his calculations, claiming that the number of people killed when the shooter is stopped by police is really closer to 14.29. He pegged the average for incidents in which civilians stop the shooter at 2.33. The Rubens campaign acknowledged that the figures he provided were incorrect, saying that Rubens now stands behind Barker\u2019s latest figures. \"Bottom line remains: an on-premises armed citizen saves lives in a shooting rampage in a public place,\" communications director Brian Tilton wrote in an email. We looked for a separate analysis of shooting incidents to determine whether those casualty figures are accurate. One of the best sources we found is an academic study published in January in an FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin by Dr. Pete Blair, director of research for the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center (ALERRT) and an associate professor of criminal justice at Texas State University. Blair and two other researchers examined more than 100 shootings between 2000 and 2012, investigating factors such as the average response time of law enforcement and the outcomes based on the actions taken by civilians at the scene. Looking at \"active shooter\" incidents, the study found the median number of people shot is five (excluding the perpetrator). Blair said shooting incidents that lead to deaths in the range of 18 people -- the number Rubens initially offered -- are rare. \"Eighteen would be really out there,\" he said. The study documented only nine incidents in which the number of people killed or wounded was 14 or higher. Blair also pointed out problems with the terminology Rubens used in his statement. The term \"mass shooting\" is widely understood to mean an incident in which four or more people are shot, he said. Therefore, incidents in which only two or three people are shot -- the average Rubens offered when civilians take action -- would generally be excluded from the category of mass shootings. Blair said it\u2019s logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun. Roughly half of all active shooter events Blair studied ended before law enforcement officers arrived. The most common occurrence was that the shooter stopped the attack spontaneously on their own. The decision was often made after an initial burst of violence, in which the shooter attacked everyone who was in the immediate area, Blair said. When those who remained either ran away or barricaded themselves in secure areas, shooters often made the decision to leave the attack site or commit suicide, he said. Blair said he also documented cases in which civilians took direct action. Civilians stopped about one out of every six active shooter events, but their actions rarely involved the use of firearms, he said. The most common method was tackling the attacker, as was the case during a campus shooting in Seattle this week. Blair said he found only three cases in which an armed civilian shot the attacker, and in two of those incidents, the civilian who took action was an off-duty police officer. Blair said it would be difficult to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of armed civilians in stopping active shooter events based on the limited data that exists. In general though, Blair said, fewer people were killed or injured in the events that ended before police showed up at the scene -- either because civilians took action, or because the shooter spontaneously stopped or committed suicide. Data suggests the best course of action for civilians is first to avoid the attacker, and if that\u2019s not possible, to deny access by barricading themselves in locked rooms or other secure areas. Blair teaches training courses for law enforcement and civilians on how to respond to active shooter events through ALERRT, which receives funding from the Bureau of Justice Administration at the U.S. Department of Justice and from the Texas governor\u2019s office. Blair said he encourages civilians to take physical action to defend themselves only when it\u2019s impossible to escape. \"We see the firearm as being an adjunct to that part,\" he said. Blair said there are pros and cons to having armed civilians at the scene of a shooting. Confronting the shooter with a gun would likely provide the fastest resolution, he said. But if multiple civilians are wielding guns at the scene, it could also create confusion about who the shooter is -- particularly for police who are arriving to render aid."

Greg Salisbury, editor ofCity & State PA, said the line about death row was a copy editing error. He said the story was corrected Monday. The above sentence now reads, \"With nothing but the rest of his life in prison ahead of him,\" and a correction is noted at the end of the piece. But another client of El-Shabazz, infamous drug dealer Kaboni Savage, presents a murkier picture. In 2013, Savage was given a federal death sentence for 12 counts of murder, six of which stemmed from a 2004 retaliatory fire bombing in North Philly. El-Shabazz, however, did not represent Savage during the federal case for which he received the death penalty. Salima Suswell, a spokesperson for El-Shabazz, said he was disqualified from representing Savage because of a conflict of interest and couldn\u2019t represent him. The conflict arose because of the earlier case in which he repped Savage. In federal court filings, El-Shabazz is not listed as an attorney for Savage in the case. The earliest motion by the defense comes from Christopher Warren, who was a court-appointed attorney. Savage wasn\u2019t El-Shabazz\u2019s client in that matter, Suswell said. \"So the statement stands as true.\" A 2004Inquirerarticle indicates El-Shabazz was representing Savage when the drug dealer was already being suspected \u2014 but not yet charged \u2014 in the fire bombing. The article explains that the FBI was targeting Savage, lists El-Shabazz as his lawyer and quotes him as saying Savage had nothing to do with the firebombing \"directly or indirectly.\" So the fact-check comes down to this question: Is it fair for a lawyer to say none of his clients have ever been sentenced to death when a major client of his received a death sentence in a case he didn\u2019t litigate after being disqualified from representing him? Two legal experts say yes. Claire Finkelstein, director of the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at Penn, said given the context, El-Shabazz\u2019s statement is not incorrect. \"He\u2019s trying to prove he\u2019s a good lawyer,\" Finkelstein said. \"If you look at the spirit of it, it doesn\u2019t falsify the claim. He\u2019s not responsible for that guy getting the death penalty.\" Said Jules Epstein, a longtime trial lawyer and a professor at Temple Law, who disclosed that he knows El-Shabazz: \"The fact that a former client got the death penalty with a different attorney is no reflection on this lawyer whatsoever.\""

While the report prepared before Obama took office did feature projections for the effect of a stimulus plan, including a projected jobless rate around 5.6 percent in mid-2012, the caveats and uncertainties surrounding these estimates are not adequately addressed by the ad.\n\nFirstly, the report was labeled as a \"projection\" rather than a \"promise,\" indicating that it was not a formal commitment made by President Obama. Secondly, the ad selectively quotes from Obama's speech introducing the report, taking out of context statements that do not necessarily support the claim being made. For instance, while Obama does say \"we'll create jobs,\" he also explicitly states that the projections are subject to margins of error and considerable uncertainty.\n\nFurthermore, the ad ignores the fact that the report was prepared before Congress had written a stimulus plan, and therefore any jobless rate projections were based on hypothetical scenarios rather than an actual policy implemented by President Obama. This context is crucial in evaluating the accuracy of the claim being made.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be some correlation between the evidence provided and the claim being made, the ad's assertions are not supported by a thorough analysis of the evidence.

    "doc": "A new ad claims President Barack Obama broke his promise about the impact of the economic stimulus plan.The ad uses a familiar Republican talking point, that Obama \"promised\" low unemployment if the stimulus was passed. We've checked many claims it would stay below 8 percent, but this ad says it would drop to 5.6 percent.It's a flashy ad from pro-Republican super PAC American Crossroads, using gleaming Minority Report-style graphics manipulated by a narrator in an empty warehouse. The version we've seen still running this week uses an outdated number, saying unemployment is \"actually\" 8.1 percent. The latest monthly report, which came out Friday, says it is now 7.8 percent.In this fact-check, we\u2019re focusing on what Obama said the jobless rate would be if Congress passed a stimulus plan.Separately, we are checking the ad\u2019s claim that \"Obama\u2019s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt.\"Here\u2019s the full narration: The screen displays the line, \"We can\u2019t afford 4 more years.\" What Obama saidWe asked American Crossroads for material to support the ad. Spokesman Jonathan Collegio referred us to a Jan. 9, 2009, report prepared before Obama took office, and a speech by the president-elect.The report, designed to help Obama argue for an aggressive response to the burgeoning jobs crisis, featured projections for the effect of a stimulus plan.Those estimates include a chart, \"Unemployment Rate With and Without Recovery Plan,\" that displays a post-stimulus jobless rate around 5.6 percent in mid 2012, like the chart in the American Crossroads ad.But Christina Romer, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser, also wrote that their estimates were \"subject to significant margins of error,\" and \"considerable uncertainty.\"We\u2019ve previously ruled that the report was not a promise, but a projection, noting its several caveats.How about the president-elect\u2019s speech introducing the report?Here, too, we find it's a stretch to describe it as a promise. It doesn\u2019t get into specific jobless rates, but does talk about projected job gains if a stimulus plan \u2014 which Congress had yet to write \u2014 were to pass.Collegio pointed out that Obama:\u2022 Said the report presented \"what this plan will mean,\" not \"roughly what this plan might mean.\"\u2022 Said \"we\u2019ll create jobs\" not \"could create jobs.\"\"Obama did promise it,\" Collegio said.But Obama\u2019s speech first presents the report\u2019s findings as \"projections,\" and later says that a stimulus plan would \"likely\" save or create 3 million to 4 million jobs. Only then does he simplify his language to say, \"we\u2019ll create\" as he talks about a focus on jobs in energy, health care and infrastructure.Here\u2019s how he sets it up: And as we mentioned, the report carried Romer and Bernstein\u2019s warnings about the uncertainty of their projections, including that \"the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.\"As we now know, as the pair prepared their estimates, the economy was already far worse than the best numbers at the time captured. The unemployment rate hit 8 percent even before Obama signed a stimulus package into law in February 2009."

    "doc": "During an Oct. 11, 2014, debate, Republican Joni Ernst and Democrat Bruce Braley -- who are facing off in one of the nation\u2019s most pivotal Senate races -- sparred over the economy. At one point in the debate, Ernst compared \"Washington, D.C., ways\" with \"Iowa values.\" She pointed to \"records of failure coming from this administration, and followers like Congressman Braley, versus our Iowa values and the way we have conducted business in the last four years. With my good supporter, (Republican Gov.) Terry Branstad, we have implemented strong economic policy here in Iowa -- lower taxes, reduced job-killing regulations, and a balanced budget, and we are putting more of our hard-working Iowans back to work with new, good-paying jobs. Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States, while nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years that Congressman Braley has been there by 2.7 percent.\" But we wondered: Is her statistical comparison between Iowa and the United States valid? We took a closer look. (Ernst\u2019s campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) 'Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States.' On the first part of the claim, Ernst has a point, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the federal government\u2019s official source of data about personal income. In the most recent quarter for which data is currently available -- the second quarter of 2014 -- personal income in Iowa increased by 2.4 percent over the previous quarter in Iowa. Only three states had faster growth -- Nebraska (2.7 percent), North Dakota (2.7 percent) and Idaho (2.5 percent). But some context serves to undercut the significance of this achievement. The statistics for such short periods of time tend to be \"noisy\" -- that is, the numbers bounce around a lot. As an illustration, let\u2019s look at the statistics for the couple of quarters before the 2.4 percent increase. Moving backward one quarter at a time, personal income growth in Iowa clocked in at -0.6 percent, -0.5 percent, 1.0 percent, 0.0 percent, and -0.2 percent. This paints a very different picture of personal income growth in Iowa. To effectively detect genuine trends, you need to study a longer period of time. Let\u2019s take a look at how Iowa did for full-year periods rather than quarters. Between full-year 2012 and full-year 2013, Iowa had the 18th-highest percentage change in personal income among the 50 states, which is quite a bit weaker than the fourth-place finish Ernst cited. Iowa fared even more poorly between 2011 and 2012, when the state ranked 43rd nationally. This, too, is quite a different picture than the one she painted in the debate. 'Nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years \u2026 by 2.7 percent.' Not if you look at median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly wage nationally in 2013 -- the most recent full year available -- was $776, up from $671 in 2008. Once you adjust the 2006 figure for inflation in 2013 dollars, it works out to be $775.37 -- meaning there was basically no change at all between 2006 and 2013. It\u2019s virtually the same if you inflation-adjust the data for 2005 -- there\u2019s no significant change in median weekly earnings between 2005 and 2013. \"What I always say when writing about wage developments, at least after the number of employed Americans started rising again in 2010, is that real wages are basically flat,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. Meanwhile, the comparison Ernst offered -- of strong Iowa growth amid national stagnation -- is flawed, for two reasons. \u2022 She\u2019s comparing two different statistics. Personal income and real wages aren\u2019t the same thing. Real wages are a component of personal income, but not the only one. They are derived from separate data sources, and they use very different methodologies. \u2022 She\u2019s comparing two different periods of time. You can\u2019t simply compare the most recent quarter with the past eight years and get a meaningful contrast. It\u2019s comparing apples and oranges. All this said, Ernst does have a point: Real wages have grown faster in Iowa over the past eight years then they have nationally. If you start the clock in 2005, real wages in Iowa increased by 1.6 percent by 2013, and if you start the clock in 2006, they increased by 1.8 percent by 2013. And she also has a point that stagnant real earnings growth over eight years is nothing to be proud of, even if she exaggerates by blaming this situation on Braley. (Lots of factors shape the economy beyond just one minority-party member of Congress.)"

Today, that same worker would earn less than the poverty line for a family of two\" is true.\n\nThe article provides a graph that shows the minimum wage over the years against household poverty levels. In 1968, the minimum wage was $1.60 an hour, and an employee working full-time would have earned $3,328 annually, which was above the poverty thresholds for a three-person household. However, there was a dual minimum wage system in place at that time, where certain groups of employees, such as those working in schools, public hospitals, laundries, hotels, and motels, were paid as little as $1.15 an hour. These employees, working full-time every week of the year, would have earned $2,392 annually and fallen below the poverty line for a three-person household.\n\nFast forwarding to modern times, the article states that the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour was established in 2009, and a full-time minimum wage earner makes $15,080 a year.

    "doc": "Pro and con, about a dozen speakers came forward last month when the House of Delegates Commerce and Labor Committee invited comment on bills to raise Virginia\u2019s minimum wage. Robin Gahan, the director of programs at the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, urged an increase, saying families can\u2019t get by on the bottom rate of $7.25 an hour, which is also the national floor. \"In 1968, a full-time worker earning minimum wage could actually support a family of three above the poverty line,\" Gahan said. \"Today, that same worker would earn less than the poverty line for a family of two.\" The Republican-controlled committee went on to kill three bills this winter that would have increased the minimum wage, maintaining that raising the rate would force employers to cut jobs. But the issue remains alive in Washington, where the U.S. Senate this spring is expected to vote on legislation that would raise the national minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. So we looked into the Interfaith Center\u2019s claim. Gahan pointed us to a December 2013 report by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that advocates boosting the wage. A graph measures the minimum wage over the years against household poverty levels. In 1968, the minimum wage for most workers was $1.60 an hour. An employee working at that rate for 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, would have earned $3,328. That was above the poverty thresholds that year for a three person-household: $2,817 annually for a home headed by a man and $2,516 for a home headed by a woman. The minimum wage was bifurcated back then, however, and a small group of employees -- including workers at schools, public hospitals, laundries, hotels and motels -- could be paid as little as $1.15 an hour. Those employees, working full time every week of the year, would have earned $2,392 annually and fallen below the poverty line for a three-person household. Congress ended the dual minimum wages in 1978. Now, let\u2019s move forward to modern times. The $7.25 hourly minimum was established in 2009. A full-time minimum wage earner makes $15,080 a year. That falls slightly below the average 2013 poverty threshold for a family of two, which is $15,156. There are a few details about all these numbers that should be noted:"

    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim \"Technology coming to Virginia allows COVID-19 personal protection equipment to be 'decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading performance'\" is labeled as \"Conflicting\" due to the inconsistencies in the provided evidence. While the Battelle Memorial Institute's decontamination system has been shown to effectively sanitize N95 masks up to 20 times, there are several reasons why reusing them beyond that limit may not be practical or effective.\n\nFirstly, research on how effective this type of decontamination is is limited, and the long-term effects on the masks' filtration quality are not well understood. N95Decon, a research collaborative, has found that hydrogen peroxide appears to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask's filtration, but the impact of repeated decontamination cycles on mask integrity is still being studied.\n\nSecondly, even if the decontamination process itself does not significantly affect the mask's fit quality, reusing the masks multiple times can lead to a decline in fit quality due to loss of shape. This is according to an N95Decon report on hydrogen peroxide, which found that fit quality declined substantially after five uses and even more so after 15 wears.\n\nThirdly, the process of decontamination requires hospitals to have other protocols in place, such as safely collecting used masks and having a plan to move them to and from the sanitization facility. This adds complexity to an already challenging situation.\n\nIn light of these factors, while Battelle's technology can help with decontamination, it is important to recognize that reusing N95 masks beyond 20 times may not be the most effective or practical solution. As PolitiFact National noted in their fact-check, government authorities and healthcare researchers are clear that this is a crisis measure and should not be seen as a substitute for ordering new masks.\n\nTherefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim, as the evidence suggests that while decontamination technology can help with the reuse of N95 masks, there are limitations to how many times they can be safely reused without compromising their effectiveness or integrity.",
    "doc": "Gov. Ralph Northamannounced that Virginia has received decontamination systems that will help provide front-line health workers with protective equipment against COVID-19. Each of the systems can massively sanitize for reuse much-sought-after N95 face masks. The systems were developed by the Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit technology company in Ohio, and received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been sending the equipment, free of charge, to various locations. Northam announced during a May 1 news conference that Virginia has gotten three of the systems, to be located in Chesterfield County, Newport News and Blacksburg. \"These systems have multiple units that are each the size of a storage container and can clean up to 80,000 masks per day using a hydrogen peroxide vapor,\" Northam said. \"(Personal protective equipment) can be decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading.\" Traditionally, N95 masks have been designated for only single use. So we fact-checked Northam\u2019s statement that the system allows the masks to be \"decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading.\" The Battelle process Hospitals send the masks to N95 sanitization centers Battelle has helped set up, including in coronavirus hot spots such as New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Workers wearing protective gear load the respirators into a sealed container. Masks are cleaned with vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, aerated and then sent back to the originating hospitals. The decontamination process takes about 12 hours. Battelle says the masks can withstand the decontamination process up to 20 times. But, as PolitiFact National recently noted, that\u2019s not a best practice. The FDA, in its letter designating emergency approval, specified that Battelle\u2019s decontamination system \"may be effective\" safely recycling masks 20 times, but it advised that recycling should only be done \"when there are insufficient supplies.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends reuse \"only be practiced as a crisis capacity strategy.\" There are several reasons. For one thing, research is limited on how effective this type of decontamination is. Also, masks vary in how they stand up to the procedure. And it\u2019s not as simple as doing a load of laundry. \"Decontamination is a complicated process,\" said Hana El-Samad, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San Francisco, who researches N95 sanitization. \"Assessing how well it works and which N95 makes and models remain unaffected is an area of active research.\" N95Decon, a research collaborative with which El-Samad works, has examined Battelle\u2019s hydrogen peroxide approach and found the chemicals appear to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask\u2019s filtration. Mask integrity Performance is only part of the equation. Another is mask structure: N95s work only when properly fitted to the face. When workers reuse the masks, they can lose their shape, which undermines the quality of fit and renders them less protective. For some masks, per an N95Decon report on hydrogen peroxide, fit quality declined substantially after just five uses. For others, it took 15 wears to see a meaningful difference. In addition, decontamination itself can in some cases worsen the respirator\u2019s fit. \"If [an N95] doesn\u2019t fit well, then air will leak around the sides and it doesn\u2019t matter how good a filter it is,\" said Patrick Kenney, medical director of the Yale-New Haven Health\u2019s corporate supply chain. Plus, using this technology requires hospitals to have other protocols in place. Used masks must be safely collected \u2015 since they could be COVID-contaminated and pose a biohazard \u2014 and a plan must be in place to move them to and from the sanitization facility. \"These are all complicated processes that need to be done right,\" El-Samad said. She offered a key takeaway: Technology like Battelle\u2019s can help. But nothing substitutes for new N95s. We should note the PolitiFact Nationalfact-checked an April 23 statement by President Trump. He said, \"We\u2019re also using a sterilization process \u2015 some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask. So that\u2019s like ordering 20 times more masks.\" PolitiFact rated the statement Half-True, saying, \"Government authorities and health care researchers are clear that this is a crisis measure and it is in no way as effective as \u2018ordering 20 times more masks.\u2019\""

So this doesn\u2019t apply to seniors on Medicare, or people between 50 and 64 years old who have employer-sponsored coverage. Under current law, insurance companies can charge older adults up to three times as much as younger people based on their age. This is known as 3-to-1 \"rate banding.\" The House bill increases the ratio up to five times starting in 2018, unless states set a different age ratio. Before the Affordable Care Act, premiums for older adults were typically four or five timesthe premiums charged to younger adults, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That more accurately reflects the actual higher costs spent for older adults\u2019 health care, said Linda Blumberg, health policy expert at the Urban Institute. So the lower 3-to-1 age ratio in the ACA was a better deal for older adults. The goal was to make coverage more affordable for older adults regardless of their health status. If the House bill with the 5-to-1 rate banding were to become law, older adults would pay more than current law, according to an estimate by the Rand Corporation, which evaluated an earlier version of the American Health Care Act, or AHCA. (The research was funded by the Commonwealth Fund, which aims to increase health care access for the poor.) The increased costs would occur, Rand Corporation said, as a result of tax credits in the House bill not increasing with age as steeply as premiums. Young people, however, would get a break on premiums. Older Americans could get hit with other costs, too The change in age ratios is just one of many provisions of the House proposal that could change the costs for older adults. The legislation would replace the current income-based tax credits with a credit based on age. For adults over 60, that would mean a $4,000 credit. For adults under 30, the credit would be $2,000. The legislation phases out tax credits for individuals who make more than $75,000 annually (or a couple who files jointly earning $150,000). Kaiser created an interactive map to show that the cost impact varies based on several factors. \"Generally, people who are older, lower-income or live in high-premium areas (like Alaska and Arizona) receive less financial assistance under the AHCA,\" Kaiser concluded about the House bill. A Congressional Budget Office analysis of an earlier version of the legislation (the final legislation did not receive a CBO score) concluded that it would disproportionately increase the number of uninsured ages 50-64 with incomes less than 200 percent of the poverty limit. For an example: Under current law, a 64-year-old with an income of $26,500 would pay a net premium of $1,700 after factoring in a tax credit. Under the House bill, according to CBO, that person\u2019s premium rises to $14,600. (See table 4) Older Americans could see more changes if states choose to redefine essential health benefits for coverage in the individual market. \"I cannot imagine a scenario where the AHCA is not worse for older adults than the ACA,\" Blumberg said. Curbelo\u2019s spokeswoman told us Curbelo has called for improving the bill that he voted for. \"The congressman is continuing to work to ensure that all Americans have access to coverage options they can afford, focusing specifically on making sure we increase the amount of the tax credits for lower income Americans and for those nearing the age of retirement,\" Joanna Rodriguez told PolitiFact."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for Newt Gingrich's claim that \"Gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected\" because while there is some credibility to Gingrich's statement based on federal statistics, there are also several concerns and issues of uncertainty that arise from the source of the information.\n\nFirstly, the FBI study used by Gingrich to support his claim acknowledges that there may be some duplication or underreporting of gang members due to how each state and local law enforcement agency measures gang activity in their area.

    "doc": "More than a week after a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in the shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin, CNN\u2019s State of the Union hosted a roundtable that included a discussion of crime and race in America. Among the panelists was Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker from Georgia. \"Gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected,\" Gingrich said. \"There is no federal program to stop it. No one wants to have an honest conversation about it.\" It wasn\u2019t the first time Gingrich had made this point. In an op-ed, Gingrich wrote, \"Although the president does not acknowledge the gangs' role as a major cause of the epidemic of violence, the FBI does. The FBI estimated in 2011 that there are roughly 1.4 million active gang members in the U.S., an astonishing 40 percent increase from 2009. These gangs, the FBI says, are responsible for \u2018an average of 48 percent of violent crime in most jurisdictions, and much higher in others.\u2019 \" We were able to locate the FBI study Gingrich referred to in the op-ed -- the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment. Gingrich accurately quoted the report, which said, \"Approximately 1.4 million active street, (outlaw motorcycle) and prison gang members, comprising more than 33,000 gangs, are criminally active\" in the United States, which \"represents a 40 percent increase from an estimated 1 million gang members in 2009.\" (The 1 million figure came from the 2009 edition of the same FBI study.) Because Gingrich\u2019s 40 percent figure comes from federal statistics, we agree that it has some credibility. But we will raise two issues of concern. Uncertainty about the statistics Because gang activity is illegal, it\u2019s difficult to get solid numbers. So the FBI estimated as best it could. To do this, the FBI used a combination of data from a survey of law enforcement agencies by the National Drug Intelligence Center, along with additional interviews with law enforcement officials. The survey the FBI used randomly sampled roughly 3,000 state and local law enforcement agencies to gauge how prevalent gangs are in their jurisdiction. This is a reasonable approach to tackling a challenging question, but it\u2019s not gospel. Criminologists warned PolitiFact to be wary of several factors. \u2022 The survey is not just an estimate -- it\u2019s an estimate of estimates. All surveys are subject to sampling error -- that is, the possibility that the people being surveyed aren\u2019t actually random, thus biasing the results. But at least many surveys sample something that the respondent will find easy to quantify -- say, whether they approve of the job President Obama is doing, or how many cars they own. The survey the FBI used, however, has uncertainty not just about whether the sample was truly random, but also about whether the answers given are actually accurate. The report itself \"acknowledges that there may be some duplication or underreporting of gang members\" because of how each state and local law enforcement agency measures gang activity in their area. \u2022 The smell test. A jump of 40 percent in just two years is an enormous increase, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. \"If there were really a 40 percent increase in two years, you would see a big impact on crime statistics generally, but we haven\u2019t,\" he said. \"Crime rates are fairly level.\" \u2022 Who counts as a gang member? There\u2019s no universal definition of who counts as a gang member. \"Actual gang members can deny membership, and wanna-bes can claim membership,\" said Eugene O\u2019Donnell, a criminologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"In both cases it is difficult to discern for sure.\" \u2022 Institutional bias. Local law enforcement officials have an interest in overstating -- or at least not understating -- the number of gang members in their jurisdiction, since a bigger gang problem can help them secure more federal assistance, O\u2019Donnell said. This wouldn\u2019t be so much of a problem for the soundness of the data if an independent assessment was also factored in, but none is. The estimate is based solely upon the opinions of state and local law-enforcement officials. All in all, O\u2019Donnell said, \"there are multiple grounds for being skeptical\" about the estimate. Making significant public policy decisions based on them would be manifestly unsound.\" Does Obama deserve blame? Gingrich said, \"Gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected.\" If he had said \"between 2009 and 2011,\" we wouldn\u2019t have addressed the issue of whether he was blaming the president. But Gingrich chose to use Obama\u2019s presidency to mark time. The Gingrich camp firmly disagrees that the former House speaker was blaming Obama for an increase in gang activity. They point to previous op-eds -- including the one we mentioned earlier -- as evidence that Gingrich was simply saying that crime issues that inspire a lot of media attention -- such as mass shootings and the Martin case -- obscure a more far-reaching crime concern, gangs. \"Newt mentioned Obama to make that contrast \u2013 in other words, \u2018Is a Trayvon Martin-type occurrence really what is most important to be focused on when it comes to the personal safety of African-Americans?\u2019\" said Joe DeSantis, a spokesman for Gingrich. \"After all, the president had just held a press conference to talk about the Martin verdict. Newt did not say that Obama was to blame for the increase in gang violence.\" The Gingrich camp is correct that he has made that argument in previous op-eds, but we didn\u2019t see him mentioning it in the CNN discussion. And because a CNN viewer most likely wouldn\u2019t have read Gingrich\u2019s past op-eds, we think it\u2019s fair to rate him in part for bringing Obama into the discussion of gang growth. There are, in fact, some things that an administration can do to bolster law enforcement generally and gang activity specifically. Contrary to Gingrich\u2019s claim that \"there is no federal program to stop\" gangs, the Justice Department does have an Organized Crime and Gang Section, which was established under Obama in late 2010 as a consolidation of several existing offices. However, while federal funding and technical assistance can help, Fox said that \"there\u2019s relatively little that the president can do to discourage a 12-year-old from joining a gang.\" Most gang activity is handled by local law enforcement departments, and both demographics, including the number of young people in an area, and economic conditions are important drivers of gang membership. \"Gangs are always hiring, even when legitimate employers aren\u2019t because the economy is in bad shape,\" Fox said. And in recessions, he added, \"younger, inner-city people are hit especially hard.\""

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is an appropriate label for the claim that Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt is unsustainable and caused by the greed of Wall Street vulture funds, based on the evidence provided. Here's why:\n\n1. The article acknowledges that Puerto Rico has been accumulating debt for decades, long before Wall Street got involved. This suggests that the island's debt problem is not solely caused by outside actors, but rather a combination of factors including local mismanagement and economic decline. (Paragraph 3)\n2. The article mentions that hedge funds and other non-traditional buyers \"eyeing fat yields and possible trading gains\" purchased $3.5 billion worth of junk bonds at a tax-free interest rate of just under 9 percent, which helped Puerto Rico dig itself into a bigger hole. This suggests that while Wall Street has certainly profited off of the situation, it is not the sole cause of Puerto Rico's debt problem. (Paragraph 7)\n3. The article highlights that Puerto Rico was already knee-deep in debt by the time the financial industry got involved, and that the island was already experiencing economic depression and population decline before Wall Street got involved. This suggests that the island's debt problem is not solely caused by outside actors, but rather a combination of factors including local mismanagement and economic decline. (Paragraph 4)\n4. The article notes that while Wall Street should be held accountable for its opportunism, the exact figure of fees received by banks like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and UBS for managing Puerto Rico's bond sales is $1.4 billion for $61 billion worth of bond sales since 2006, which is a relatively modest role in creating the need for a comprehensive debt solution. (Paragraph 8)\n\nBased on these points, it can be argued that while Wall Street has certainly profited off of Puerto Rico's debt crisis, the island's debt problem is not solely caused by outside actors and is instead the result of a combination of factors including local mismanagement and economic decline. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "Bernie Sanders condemned Wall Street for creating and now profiting off Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis during a campaign stop on the island. Puerto Rico is currently $72 billion in debt and, in the words of its governor, in \"a death spiral.\" Unlike other states and cities, it cannot legally declare bankruptcy. So Sanders called for the Federal Reserve to help the U.S. territory out, just as it bailed out the financial sector responsible for imperilling 3.5 million Puerto Ricans in the first place. \"I think all of us understand and your government understands that Puerto Rico\u2019s $70 billion debt is unsustainable and it is unpayable,\" Sanders said May 16 at a town hall in San Juan. \"And the reason why it is unsustainable has everything to do with the greed of Wall Street vulture funds.\" So is Wall Street to blame for the island\u2019s economic woes? Sanders has a point that hedge funds and banks are certainly exacerbating the situation and, in some cases, attempting to block a solution. However, experts told us and the research showsthat Puerto Rico has been accumulating debt long before Wall Street got involved. Origins of the debt This $72 billion debt did not appear solely thanks to the maneuvers of Wall Street. Rather, it\u2019s been building up for decades, resulting from a combination of U.S. policy, local mismanagement and economic decline. The local government has essentially maxed out a very special credit card given to it and other U.S. territories. When the island became a commonwealth in 1917, Congress also made bonds issued by the Puerto Rican government \"triple tax-exempt\" (meaning they can\u2019t be taxed at the federal, state or local level) and thus very attractive to investors. For decades, this allowed the government to overspend, in part out of necessity and in part out of sheer irresponsibility. Puerto Rico has had to pick up a disportionate chunk of the tab for federal social programs. More than 60 percent of its residents receive Medicare or Medicaid, but federal funding is considerably lower than the states. (For example, $3 billion for Oklahoma\u2019s Medicaid program and $3.6 billion for Mississippi\u2019s compared to $373 million for the island, a fraction of its $2.9 billion in expenses.) Disparities in funding aside, the local government has also made some poor management and spending decisions. Inefficient public utilities have been running up the tab since the 1940s and now account for the largest portion of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt ($20 billion). Meanwhile, the state-run power authority continues to dole out free electricity. Similarly, public employees enjoy \"lavish pension benefits\" like holiday bonuses and loans for international travel but the pensions remain severely underfunded ($1.9 billion in assets versus $45.5 billion in liabilities). Now add in changes in federal policy, economic depression and population decline and you\u2019ve got a recipe for even less revenue and total debt unsustainability. For decades, U.S. businesses operating in Puerto Rico received significant tax breaks, an economic boon for the island. But that all ended in 1996, when President Bill Clinton signed legislation phasing out the incentives over 10 years. By 2006, Puerto Rico was already $43 billion in debt and fell into a recession that, compounded by the global financial crisis, continues to this day. Marc Joffe, the principal consultant at Public Sector Credit Solutions, tracked Puerto Rico\u2019s debt from 1910 to 2015. Here\u2019s a chart we made using his data: Wall Street\u2019s role The island was already knee-deep in debt by the time the financial industry got involved, but Wall Street is certainly profiting off of the situation. According to Sanders in his San Juan address and his campaign, hedge funds now hold about 50 percent of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt. This is the high end of estimates we found, which range from 20 percent to 50 percent. But this is a relatively recent development. Prior to 2014, most of Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds were owned by traditional mutual funds and retail investors, according to Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who previously worked in the Obama administration's Treasury Department. Morningstar, the research investment firm, estimated that some 180 mutual funds had Puerto Rican bonds in their portfolios in 2013. In 2014, multiple credit ratings agencies downgraded Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds to junk status. Because of the high risk associated with this low grade, most traditional investors were unable or unwilling to invest. Enter Wall Street. Hedge funds and other non-traditional buyers \"eyeing fat yields and possible trading gains\" purchased $3.5 billion worth of junk bonds at a tax-free interest rate of just under 9 percent (the high rate reflecting the high risk). As Puerto Rico\u2019s debt had already topped $70 billion in 2013, $3.5 billion wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference. \"The combination of Puerto Rico\u2019s decision (to sell more bonds) and the availability of Wall Street financing helped Puerto Rico dig itself into a bigger hole,\" said Setser. In fact, if the hedge funds hadn\u2019t purchased these bonds, which were after all issued to pay off old debt, \"the crisis would have come a little earlier since the level of debt was already unsustainable,\" said Joffe of Public Sector Credit Solutions. That being said, Wall Street should be held accountable for its opportunism as some hedge funds and banks have certainly chosen to take advantage of the situation, said Rafael Fantauzzi of the National Puerto Rican Coalition. Since 2014, hedge funds have been buying up bonds on the cheap in the secondary market (those previously owned by traditional investors). Sanders\u2019 campaign provided PolitiFact an example of bonds bought for 29 cents on the dollar yielding an interest of 34 percent. Bloomberg has reported yields ranging from under 10 percent to as high as 80 percent. Sanders in his San Juan speech and his campaign also noted that banks like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and UBS have received hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to manage the island\u2019s bond sales. The exact figure, according to the Wall Street Journal, is $1.4 billion for $61 billion worth of bond sales since 2006. That\u2019s the equivalent of a service charge of 2.3 percent, double the average rate for municipal bond sales but quadruple the rate for corporate bond sales. Exacerbating the situation The most damning evidence for \"the greed of vulture funds\" is Wall Street\u2019s efforts to prevent Puerto Rico from digging itself out of the hole. As we\u2019ve previously reported, Puerto Rico is legally unable to declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy. But there is currently legislation in motion to allow the island to restructure the debt. The Sanders campaign forwarded us a New York Times report of a letter representatives of BlueMountain, a hedge fund that holds Puerto Rican bonds, sent to Republican staff members urging against allowing debt restructuring. The Center for Individual Freedom, a dark money group, has also spent $2 million on issue ads against debt relief efforts in Congress, supporting the hedge funds\u2019 position. \"That\u2019s very concerning that financial interests, specially these so-called \u2018vulture funds,\u2019 are disrupting the political process and preventing Puerto Rico having a smoother landing in this situation they got themselves into,\" said Joffe, adding that that\u2019s what they did in Argentina as well. In lieu of debt restructuring, Wall Street recommends cutting spending. A report commissioned by 34 hedge funds advises Puerto Rico to raise taxes, lay off teachers, close schools, and cut wages and worker benefits, Medicaid, and welfare. (About 45.4 percent of Puerto Ricans live below the poverty line and the commonwealth already closed 150 schools in the last five yearsand increased its sales tax.) So while the hedge funds and banks \"have played a relatively modest role in creating the need for a comprehensive debt solution,\" said Setser, they are \"playing a more important role in hindering a bipartisan solution.\""

    "doc": "One of the most prevalent attacks against Florida Gov. Charlie Crist is that he abandoned the Republican Party and decided to run for the U.S. Senate as a no-party candidate out of political expediency and nothing more.He heard it from both Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Kendrick Meek in their Oct. 24, 2010, debate on CNN.But Crist countered that his decision had more to do with a far-right shift in the Republican Party. \"The Republican Party and the right wing of that party went so far right. It's exactly why Marco Rubio stayed there (and) it's exactly the same reason that I left,\" Crist said. \"He wants to overturn -- listen to me, women watching -- overturn Roe v. Wade. He does not support stem cell research. You know, these are extreme views that I am not comfortable with.\"The line produced one of many heated exchanges between Rubio and Crist. Rubio, in his rebuttal, tried to point out Crist's hypocrisies.\"We don't need to go down the long and torturous road of the governor's change on positions and so forth. That's been well-documented,\" Rubio said. \"I mean, I do think it's curious that he attacks me for positions he held, like, six months ago, (when) he was running in the Republican primary and we were debating together on Fox News.\"We previously have analyzed Crist's flip-flopping on things like oil drilling, the federal health care bill and even a controversial education bill that Crist vetoed in 2010. But what struck us in this case was that Rubio not only accused Crist of flipping on issues, but then brazenly criticizing Rubio for positions Crist himself held not too long ago. Our gameplan is to start the search where Rubio suggested, a Fox News debate back on March 28, 2010. But we also think it's fair to at least examine other Crist attacks that didn't come up in the March Fox debate.Looking back at Crist-R, circa March 2010Much of the Fox debate, moderated by Chris Wallace, focused on Crist and Rubio arguing about Rubio's personal finances. (Some things never change).But when it came to policy issues, the debate largely covered four topics -- jobs and the economy, Social Security, health care and immigration. What we found might actually surprise you -- Crist's statements then and now are very consistent.Both in March and this month, he said he would support the idea of raising the eligibility age for Social Security. Then and now, he said he supported the federal stimulus program. Then there's his answers on immigration. They are nearly identical. He said both in March and during the October CNN debate that the country needed to first secure or seal the border and enforce the laws now on the books. Then, in both instances, he talked about a way to gain citizenship for people now living here illegally. \"If they have the opportunity to gain citizenship, they should go to the back of the line, go through the regular process, what the law requires, in order to attain their citizenship,\" Crist said on March 28 as a Republican. Then on Oct. 24 as an independent: \"People should have to get in the back of the line, pay a fine if necessary, their back taxes, and be able to become productive members of the American economy. It's a compassionate way.\" In matters of policy, the closest PolitiFact Florida could come in finding a difference between March and now comes in discussing the federal health care bill. On March 28, Crist he would vote to repeal the bill. In an Oct. 6 ABC debate, Crist said he was against the health care bill and said it needed to be fixed (health care wasn't discussed during the CNN debate). In other cases, he said the health care bill should be repealed but be accompanied by a responsible substitute.Meek is attacking Rubio for wanting to repeal the health care bill, but Crist isn't.Claims about abortion, stem cell research Without much to go on from the Fox News debate, we turned to two attacks Crist levied against Rubio directly during the CNN/St. Petersburg Times debate -- that Rubio wants to overturn Roe v. Wade and that he opposes embryonic stem cell research. Did Crist once oppose stem cell research? Did Crist once want to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion in America?On embryonic stem cell research, Crist generally has been supportive of it. When he ran for governor as a Republican in 2006, Crist said he favored embryonic stem cell research. The position put him at odds with former President George W. Bush. And in May 2010, Crist vetoed state budget language banning tax dollars from being used to support human embryonic stem cell research.Crist's record on abortion, however, is more difficult to decipher. But not necessarily on overturning Roe vs. Wade.When he was running for the U.S. Senate in 1998, Crist said that he was pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. \"I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government,\" he said. In a subsequent debate, he said he would not support a constitutional amendment banning abortion -- essentially overturning Roe vs. Wade.In 2006, when he was running for governor, Crist said he was pro-life. But he would not support repealing Roe vs. Wade. \"I don't think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians, and I think it's very important to respect the medical profession,\" said Crist, whose father is a doctor.In the 2010 Republican U.S. Senate primary, Crist said he would support \"pro-life\" legislation like tax credits and subsidies for parents who adopt. He didn't answer questions about Roe vs. Wade.So Crist is attacking Rubio on both stem cell research and Roe vs. Wade, but there is no evidence his position has changed on those issues since the spring.Gay adoption Rubio has used this line about Crist attacking him before. During an ABC News debate earlier in October, Crist chastised Republicans like Rubio and South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint for telling people \"who they should love and who they shouldn't.\" In that context, Crist said he supported a court's decision to lift a ban in the state on gay couples adopting a child. That prompted Rubio to respond. \"I think it\u2019s always funny to listen to the Governor attack me for positions he himself held just six months ago, when he was trying to be the biggest conservative in the world and win the Republican primary.\" Crist's accusation meets our definition of an attack.And it turns out Crist himself in the past has supported the gay adoption ban.That's our definition of a flip.Back in 2006, when he running for governor as a Republican, Crist said that \"my position is the traditional family is the best to adopt.\" The comments came after earlier comments suggested he might support lifting the ban and allegations from Republicans like former state Rep. Dennis Baxley that he supported gay adoptions.And then on one day in July 2009, he told reporters two different things. When one group of reporters asked if he would support legislation to change the law, he said, \"I'd have to think about it.\" Later in the day, he said he supported the ban. \"I think Florida has it right right now,\" he said.In February 2010, just eight months ago, Crist's office confirmed to the Orlando Sentinel that he supported the ban.Crist defends the differing positions by saying he was simply enforcing the laws on the books of the state. That's a weak argument. Laws change all the time. At the behest of leaders.Rubio's responseTo add to its case, the Rubio campaign sent us back to that Fox News debate, and the discussion of Social Security. One of the criticisms Crist consistently has made against Rubio, and a claim that PolitiFact has analyzed, is that Rubio wants to cut Social Security benefits.Crist said during the Fox debate that he would not raise the retirement age or change cost-of-living adjustments for beneficiaries and proposed one of the ways to help keep Social Security solvent is to cut waste and fraud. But the moderator didn't think eliminating waste and fraud was a practical solution and pressed further.\"Don't you actually have to make some benefit changes if you're going to deal with this debt issue?\" Fox's Wallace asked.\"Well, I think you might have to make some,\" Crist answered. \"But I think what you want to do first is get the waste and the fraud out.\"Crist clearly was against raising the retirement age and against benefit adjustments based on his answers. When he was pressed about the effectiveness of his plan to fix Social Security, he said some benefits changes might be needed. But then quickly said his plan \u2014 get the waste and fraud out \u2014 could work. We think it's a stretch to use an answer he was pressed into giving as evidence of a flip-flop.Rubio's campaign also noted that Crist went from being a proud Republican to essentially attacking much of the Republican Party for a far-right ideological shift. We won't disagree with that. But we're focusing on policy issues here."

I\u2019m loving watching these GOP Senators and members of Congress saying the same old stuff concerning gun violence and listening to them get their asses handed to them by citizens that are tired of seeing 75-100 folks killed a month and over 200 wounded by senseless gun violence. Is the number that large? When we reached out to Ojeda, he said we should look at the federal statistics and \"just do the research.\" We did, and we found that his numbers were actually an understatement. The official data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides the number of gun-related deaths nationally. The most recent year for which data is available is 2017. Here are the figures: Homicides: 14,542 deaths by guns Suicides: 23,854 deaths by guns Other: 1,377 deaths by guns Total deaths by guns: 39,773 That works out to 3,314 total gun-related deaths nationally per month, and 1,212 gun-related homicides per month. Both figures are much higher than Ojeda\u2019s estimate of 75 to 100 per month. However, Ojeda\u2019s figures would have been in the ballpark if he had been talking about gun-related deaths per day. There are about 109 gun-related deaths per day, about 40 of which are homicides and 65 of which are suicides. We also checked to see if the numbers work for firearm deaths in West Virginia alone. They don\u2019t -- in this case, the number is too small. West Virginia saw 348 total deaths from guns in 2017, which works out to 29 per month, or close to one a day. What about injuries? The CDC has data on that as well. In 2015, the most recent year available, there were 84,997 non-fatal injuries by guns nationally. That works out to 7,083 per month, a number well above the 200 Ojeda cited. Here, too, the data fits better if it\u2019s calculated on a per-day basis. There were about 233 non-fatal injuries per day. That\u2019s not far off from the number Ojeda offered. All told, though, his numbers are far off from what he said in the tweet."

    "justification": "The claim that Mitch McConnell voted \"three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas\" is misleading because it implies that these tax breaks specifically incentivized companies to move jobs out of the country, when in fact they did not. The evidence provided shows that the votes McConnell cast were on legislation that sought to close already-existing corporate tax deductions, rather than create new incentives for outsourcing. These deductions did not pertain to outsourcing specifically because under current law, there is no special provision that gives corporations a deduction or any kind of tax break for moving employees out of the country.\n\nThe claim is also simplistic and misleading because it ignores the context of the votes McConnell cast. The legislation he opposed was not aimed at creating incentives for outsourcing, but rather at stopping existing deductions that benefited all businesses, both those that insource and those that outsource. The amount of money associated with these standard deductions is minuscule compared to corporate tax revenue overall, and eliminating them would not have a significant impact on companies' decision-making regarding outsourcing.\n\nTherefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the claim does not accurately reflect the context of the votes McConnell cast or the content of the legislation he opposed. While it is true that McConnell voted against measures that could have resulted in a small amount of lost revenue for companies that outsource, this does not mean that he voted to send jobs overseas. In fact, the evidence suggests that these votes were primarily focused on closing existing loopholes and deductions, rather than creating new incentives for outsourcing.",
    "doc": "Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic Senate candidate from Kentucky, says that as Mitch McConnell\u2019s wealth has grown, he has hindered Kentucky\u2019s prosperity. Recently, we looked at an ad in which Grimes said McConnell, the incumbent Senate minority leader, made millions while in public office. We rated that claim Mostly False. But that was only one of several claims in the ad that attacked McConnell for being out-of-touch with average Kentuckians and biased toward the wealthy. Another claim caught our attention: McConnell voted \"three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas.\" We\u2019ve noticed that this claim -- that a candidate voted for tax breaks that send jobs overseas --is a trending talking point among Democratic candidates, and we\u2019ve found that often the claim is simplistic and misleading. So we decided to see whether or not Grimes\u2019 claim about McConnell stacks up. The votes The ad makes it sound as if McConnell voted three times to approve corporate tax breaks that incentivize outsourcing specifically. This is not the case. Forevidence for its claims, the Grimes campaign pointed us to informationon their website. All three \"no\" votes were on legislation that sought to close already-existing corporate tax deductions. These deductionsdid not pertain to outsourcing specifically because under current law, there is no special provision that gives corporations a deduction or any kind oftax breakfor moving employees out of the country. McConnell\u2019s first \"no\" vote was in 2010 on the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act. The second and third \"no\" votes were on the Bring Jobs Home Act, which was proposed in 2012 and again in 2014. These votes, split almost exclusively along party lines, were on procedural measures that ultimately prevented the bills from receiving a final passage vote. Both laws would have given a tax benefit to companies that insourcejobs and denied an already-existing tax break to companies that outsourcethem. The tax breaks that the law would have stopped are actually standard business expense deductions. Companies can write off many business-related expenses as tax-deductible -- including relocation. But this isn\u2019t a special provision just for businesses that move outside of the United States. A business would get the same deductions for money spent moving from New York to California. Tax experts we spoke with said the law was almost entirely symbolic. The amount of money associated with these standard deductions is minuscule, compared to corporate tax revenue overall. So minuscule, in fact, that getting rid of deductions for business expenses associated with outsourcing would not be nearly enough to affect a company\u2019s decision to engage in foreign activity. \"It adds up to a trivial amount of money,\" said James Hines, a professor of law and economics at the University of Michigan. \"Given how many big multinational firms we have, it\u2019s impossible that it has any effect on their behavior.\" Eliminating standard deductions for costs associated with outsourcing would result in an average $14.2 million a year in revenue, according to Joint Committee on Taxation estimates. That\u2019s not much in the grand scheme of things. For some perspective, the Internal Revenue Service took in $273.5 billion in corporate income taxes in 2013 alone, according to the Tax Policy Center, a research group, based on Office of Management and Budget data. Revenue from eliminating that deduction would amount to 0.005 percent of total revenue. Among Republicans\u2019 reasons for opposing the Bring Jobs Home Act, the policy would have lost revenue and added to the deficit, according to Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation. The government would have spent more money on the tax credit for insourcing than it would have raised by eliminating deductions related to outsourcing. Overall, the policy would have resulted in an estimated $214 million loss over 10 years."

Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. The article cites a letter written by Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, in which he compares the earnings of the portion of the Permanent School Fund managed by the land office to the earnings on the state\u2019s savings account, otherwise known as the Economic Stabilization Fund. According to Patterson, the GLO-managed PSF earned 22 percent last year, while the rainy day fund earned only 1 percent. This comparison suggests that the portfolio managed by the land office outperformed the state\u2019s emergency reserve account.\n2. The article provides an agency report to the Legislature stating that through March 2012, the market value of the agency\u2019s investments made from the Permanent School Fund was $3.077 billion, with nearly half of that reflecting \"externally managed direct real estate investments\" and nearly $1.2 billion \"attributable to short-term investments\" in the state\u2019s treasury. The report shows that gross time-weighted returns on the portfolio in the 12 months through March amounted to nearly 23 percent, which is higher than the 1 percent gain experienced by the emergency reserve account.\n3. The article also provides information on the earnings of the real estate investments through March 2012, which generated nearly 14 percent in market value in the 12 months through March 2011, but lost about 15 percent in the 12 months through March 2010. This suggests that the real estate investments have been consistently generating returns, although they may not always be positive.\n4. The article quotes Patterson as saying that he does not count the cash-on-call funds as part of the investment portfolio, which supports the conclusion that the earnings on the real estate investments are higher than the earnings on the cash-on-call funds.\n\nBased on these points, it can be concluded that the claim is true and that the portfolio managed by the Texas General Land Office did indeed earn 22 percent last year while the state\u2019s emergency reserve account experienced a 1 percent gain.",
    "doc": "Criticizing a poke at his not releasing millions of dollars to support public schools, Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said that doing so might cut into double-digit returns on investments managed by the General Land Office.In a letter he made public Aug. 22, 2012, Patterson, a Republican, said that those who want him to transfer $300 million in investment earnings to the State Board of Education for school needs do not understand the value of keeping such money invested so the state\u2019s education endowment, the Permanent School Fund, continues to gain value.A pro-Democratic group, Progress Texas, accuses Patterson of inappropriately hoarding the millions. Patterson counters that the School Land Board, which he chairs, has discretion over whether to transfer the money and, he told us by telephone, it has until September 2013 to decide. His spokesman, Jim Suydam, also told us by email that the board approved a resolution in early 2011 to release $250 million of earnings in both 2012 and 2013 to the State Board of Education.In his letter, Patterson said that draining off additional earnings as Progress Texas says he must is a \"bad choice... because last year the GLO-managed PSF earned 22 percent and, due to statutory liquidity requirements, the rainy day fund earned just 1 percent.\" He was comparing the portion of the Permanent School Fund managed by the land office to earnings on the state\u2019s savings account, otherwise known as the Economic Stabilization Fund. \"If your family needed a quick infusion of cash,\" Patterson wrote, \"would you withdraw cash from the investment account earning 22 percent or the account earning 1 percent?\"We\u2019re not venturing that question, but wondered if Patterson made an accurate earnings comparison.Starting in 2005, the land office was given the authority to invest in real estate using proceeds received from selling lands or drawing on revenue from Permanent School Fund mineral leases and royalties, the agency notes on a web page. Professional fund management firms oversee the investments, the agency says, while the land board, consisting of the commissioner and two citizen appointees, manages the sale of Permanent School Fund land and mineral leases.To our inquiry, Suydam provided an agency report to the Legislature stating that through March 2012, the market value of the agency\u2019s investments made from the Permanent School Fund was $3.077 billion, about half of that reflecting \"externally managed direct real estate investments\" and nearly $1.2 billion \"attributable to short-term investments\" in the state\u2019s treasury, which Suydam later said means money set aside so it\u2019s on call for the agency\u2019s real estate investments.The report, dated Sept. 1, 2012, says that gross \"time-weighted\" returns on the portfolio in the 12 months through March amounted to nearly 22.9 percent, though that is without considering the short-term investments. Counting the cash-on-call portion, the report says, the time-weighted returns on the portfolio were 13.03 percent.\"Time-weighted\" returns?By email, Suydam told us the term describes a \"complex calculation that uses values for every day in the period being measured\" which, he said, explains why the 23 percent return shown for the real estate investments does not align with the 30 percent return that we calculated by comparing the market value of those investments at the end of March 2012 to the comparable figure at the end of March 2011.Asked how the earnings on real estate through March 2012 compare to recent 12-month periods, Suydam said such investments generated nearly 14 percent in market value in the 12 months through March 2011, but lost about 15 percent in the 12 months through March 2010.We checked on the rainy day fund\u2019s earnings with Lauren Willis, spokeswoman for State Comptroller Susan Combs, who oversees state finances.Willis said by email that money in the reserve fund, created in 1988, is invested like other funds in the state\u2019s treasury in stable, high-quality investments. In 2011, Willis said, the average yield on all those funds was 0.74 percent -- generating nearly $194 million in interest income including $51.9 million added to the rainy day fund. R.J. DeSilva, another Combs spokesman, said by email the rate of return might or might not have been about the same through the 12 months running through March 2012.In a telephone interview, we asked Patterson about why his letter mentions the higher returns on the real estate investments alone rather than also taking into account the lower returns influenced by the agency\u2019s cash-on-call funds.\"I don\u2019t count the cash,\" Patterson replied, \"because it\u2019s not part of our investment portfolio.\"The land office, Patterson noted, is limited by law to managing just part of the overall education endowment. Suydam later said by email that as of the end of March, the market value of the agency\u2019s portion of the PSF, not including the value of minerals or state-owned land, was nearly $3.1 billion. He said the State Board of Education oversaw the fund\u2019s remaining $25.6 billion."

PolitiFact's investigation found that his salary information from the public school system in Stokes County shows that his annual salary is $44,472 before taxes, health insurance, and childcare costs are taken out. This is lower than the most recent median income calculated for Stokes County and all North Carolina residents. Additionally, PolitiFact's calculation of Brandes' monthly paycheck shows that he takes home around $2,752 per month, which works out to $688 per week and $137 per day. This is significantly less than the $53 per day figure he claimed on Facebook. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that Brandes' claim of being paid $53 per day to educate children is exaggerated and False.",
    "doc": "For the hottest debate in North Carolina politics, look no further than teacher pay. Gov. Roy Cooper often talks about the need for higher teacher pay. Meanwhile, Republicans in the GOP-controlled legislature brag about raising teacher salaries each of the past five years. Now, with teachers scheduled to rally in Raleigh on May 16 to raise awareness about the need for more education funding, one teacher\u2019s story has gained traction in the politisphere. Nick Cols, a teacher from Western North Carolina, posted on Facebook that his \"take home pay\" for April was $1,715 after insurance and child-care and taxes were deducted. \"I am roughly being paid $53 a day to educate your child,\" he posted. PolitiFact usually sticks to fact-checking politicians, pundits, fake news sites and prominent organizational leaders. But this claim quickly gained traction not only in North Carolina news butacross the country. His story was shared by Cooper and others to emphasize their position that state lawmakers aren\u2019t properly funding education. With that in mind, PolitiFact found it necessary to review his claim. We reached out to the teacher for comment on specifics of his salary, but didn\u2019t hear back. He also deleted the post. So we then reached out to the public school system in Stokes County, where he works. What records show Wage information for public school teachers \u2014 and all government employees \u2014 is public record. So Melisa Jessup, executive director of human resources for Stokes County Schools and the district\u2019s lead spokeswoman, provided PolitiFact with the teacher\u2019s information. The teacher \u2014 whose full name is Nicholas Brandes \u2014 works at North Stokes High School and has been a teacher for nine years and eight months, Jessup said. That means, under thestate\u2019s salary schedule for teachers with bachelor\u2019s degrees, he qualifies for an annual salary of $40,550 from the state. (A first-year teacher with a bachelor\u2019s degree would receive a $35,000 salary, which would jump above $40,000 after 10 years, $45,000 after 15 years, and $50,000 after 23 years.) North Carolina\u2019s public school teachers also receive supplements from their county governments. In Stokes County, that means Brandes getsabout 4 percent of his annual state salaryadded to his pay from the county. That would mean a teacher with his level of experience makes about $42,172 per year before taxes. On top of that, Brandes is currently an assistant coach for the football and wrestling teams. So he receives an additional $2,300 for each year that he coaches those teams. How his pay compares So that puts his annual salary at $44,472 before taxes, health insurance and childcare costs are taken out. That $44,472 salary is slightly higher than the most recent median income calculated for Stokes County \u2014$42,489\u2014 but lower than the most recent median income calculated for all North Carolina residents,$48,256. The average salary for North Carolina teachers across the board (including all levels of experience) is$51,214. Some teachers choose to only accept checks during the school year, which runs from mid August to early June. Brandes chose to have his salary spread out over 12 months, so his monthly income is about $3,706. And, according to Jessup, his deductions for \"optional supplemental insurances and various other pre-tax deductions, as well as health insurance costs\" come out to about $954 a month. That includeschildcare. That leaves him with about $2,752 a month. Now let\u2019s look at weekly and daily pay. Excluding holidays or days off, there are typically four five-day work weeks in a month. A monthly $2,752 paycheck spreads out to $688 a week and $137 a day. Checking the check Rather than speak hypothetically, let\u2019s return to the $1,715 paycheck Brandes posted on Facebook. There appear to be problems with the teacher\u2019s math. To arrive at the $53-per-day figure for April, Brandes would\u2019ve had to divide $1,715 by 32 days. However, there were 30 days in April. More importantly, the school system told PolitiFact that Brades worked approximately 21.5 days in April. So his check for that month \u2014 $1,715 \u2014 divided by 21.5 equals $79.76 per day. That difference of $26.76 per day doesn\u2019t sound like much. But extrapolated over 21.5 days, there\u2019s a $575 difference between what readers might think Brandes earned in April versus what he actually made. Apply the same math ($575 times 12) over a year and there\u2019s a difference of $6,906 between what Brandes could be taking home annually compared with what could be derived from Facebook and in the media."

According to the latest actuary report released in January 2014, the Providence pension fund had $336 million in assets as of June 30, 2013, which is significantly lower than the $1.2 billion needed to cover its current and future pension obligations. This means that the claim is accurate in terms of the funding shortfall faced by the pension system.\n\nSecondly, the article provides a detailed explanation of why up-to-date data on the city's pension obligations were not available at the time the statement was made. The city was withholding this information as part of an ongoing dispute with its actuary, Buck Consultants, which suggests that the delay in providing accurate data was not due to any intentional misrepresentation by the mayor or his predecessor.\n\nFinally, the article includes a defense of Harrop's figures, stating that he cited two blog postings from reporter Ted Nesi of WPRI.com, which provided the necessary information at the time the statement was made. This suggests that Harrop's figures were based on reliable sources and were not simply pulled out of thin air.\n\nBased on these factors, it can be concluded that the claim \"\"We see a quarter-billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion.\"\" is accurate and deserves the label \"True\".",
    "doc": "Providence Mayor Angel Taveras had to deal with near bankruptcy in the capital city after he took office in 2011. As the city struggled to fix its budget problems, he won union concessions to reduce pension costs. But critics question how far the pension deal negotiated by Taveras, now a candidate for governor, went to fix the problem. The most recent figures released last month show the plan is only 31.4-percent funded. Republican mayoral candidate Daniel Harrop raised the issue during the Dec. 15, 2013, edition of WPRI's \"Newsmakers\" program. Asked why he wants to run again, he said the city needs a mayor who will stay around to solve the city's long-term problems and not have aspirations for higher office, like Taveras and his predecessor, David Cicilline, now a member of Congress. \"We see a quarter billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion,\" Harrop said. That would mean that the city, at the time, had a pension system that was only 20 percent funded. (The U.S. Government Accountability Office says public pension plans should be at least 80 percent funded.) First, we need to explain why we're ruling on a seemingly-straightforward statement two months after it was made. We began work on this item in December but getting up-to-date numbers about the city's pension fund turned out to be maddeningly difficult. The city was often slow to respond and listed different amounts in different reports over different time frames. We decided to wait for the completion of the latest estimate of the city's accrued liability, in part because the city has refused to release an earlier actuary report for the year ending June 30, 2012, citing a dispute over its accuracy. Finally, a week ago, the city released the latest actuarial report, for the year ending June 30, 2013, allowing us to proceed. So let\u2019s go back to December, when Harrop made his statement. At that point, we asked Harrop about his figures. He cited two blog postings on the Providence pension system from reporter Ted Nesi of WPRI.com. One, published Oct. 30, reported that the fund had $283 million in assets on Oct. 22. The other, published Dec. 7, said the fund had a liability of \"almost $1.2 billion.\" Harrop also cited a 2011 city report saying the liability as of June 30, 2010, was $1.256 billion, with assets of $316 million. We don't know the precise status of the pension system the day Harrop made his statement. But now that we have the up-to-date financial reports, we do have a snapshot of what the system's assets and liabilities were as of June 30, 2013. According to that latest actuary report, released Jan. 31, 2014, on June 30 the city needed $1.2 billion to cover its current and future pension obligations. On that point, Harrop turns out to have been right on the money. At the same time, according to both the actuary report and the city's latest annual financial report, released about a month after Harrop made his statement, the Providence pension fund had $336 million in investments and other assets, a lot more than what Harrop stated. The amount in the city's investment account was $247 million. In addition, there was $3 million in cash and $59 million the city paid into the fund that year. Finally, the report counted as an asset $26 million owed to the fund from loans made to people in the retirement system at a rate of 9.25 percent, according to David Ortiz, spokesman for Mayor Taveras. Add all those together and you get the $336 million. In Harrop\u2019s defense, at the time he made his statement, up-to-date data on the city\u2019s pension obligations were not available. The city was withholding it as part of an ongoing dispute with its actuary, Buck Consultants, who the city accused of making \"fundamental and inexcusable errors\" in its 2012 pension calculations. This year Providence used a different firm, Segal Consulting."

    "justification": "The claim that Donald Trump was \"forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times\" is supported by the evidence provided. According to the article, Trump's businesses have filed for Chapter 11 reorganization four times: in 1991 for the Trump Taj Mahal casino, in 1992 for the Trump Plaza Hotel, in 2004 for Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, and in 2009 for Trump Entertainment Resorts.\n\nThe evidence provided suggests that Trump's businesses filed for bankruptcy as a result of financial difficulties, rather than as a result of poor decision-making or unethical behavior. For example, the article states that the Trump Taj Mahal casino accumulated $3 billion in debt by 1991, and that Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts missed a $53.1 million bond interest payment in 2008. These financial problems were likely beyond Trump's control, and filing for bankruptcy was a way to restructure the companies' debt and avoid liquidation.\n\nFurthermore, the article quotes experts who argue that filing for bankruptcy is a common business decision that can be a sound choice when a company is facing serious financial problems. For example, Michael Venditto, a partner at the ReedSmith law firm, states that bankruptcy can be a \"sound business decision\" when the company is facing serious financial problems, and that it's better than the business shutting down completely.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label Donald Trump as having filed for bankruptcy four times. The label accurately reflects the information presented in the article, and does not make any unfair or unsubstantiated claims about Trump's business practices.",
    "doc": "In an effort to take out frontrunner Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidates have pelted Trump with criticism over his multiple trips to federal bankruptcy court. That criticism was on full display in CNN\u2019s Republican debate Sept. 16. Most notably, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina criticized Trump\u2019s history of bankruptcies in his businesses. \"You know, there are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other people's money,\" Fiorina said. \"That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos. You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people's money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times.\" Trump doesn\u2019t deny that four of his businesses have filed for bankruptcy. He argues, however, that filing for bankruptcy is a common business decision, and he was smart to make the moves when he did. \"Hundreds of companies\" have filed for bankruptcy, Trump said earlier in the debate. \"I used the law four times and made a tremendous thing. I'm in business. I did a very good job.\" Trump\u2019s four bankruptcies were Chapter 11 reorganizations (named for its location in federal bankruptcy code), which are designed to restructure businesses without shutting them down completely. The purpose is to \"save\" the business, as opposed to other forms of bankruptcy which would liquidate the company, said Michael Venditto, a partner at the ReedSmith law firm who has extensive experience with Chapter 11. Because they keep coming up, we decided to outline Trump\u2019s four bankruptcies. We also talked to some finance experts, who told us Trump is correct that Chapter 11 reorganization is not always the result of bad business decisions. Bankruptcy 1: The Trump Taj Mahal, 1991 The first bankruptcy associated with Trump was perhaps the most significant in terms of his personal finances, according to news reports at the time. He funded the construction of the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, which opened in 1990. By 1991, the casino was nearly $3 billion in debt, while Trump had racked up nearly $900 million in personal liabilities, so the business decided to file for Chapter 11 reorganization, according to the New York Times. As a result, Trump gave up half his personal stake in the casino and sold his yacht and airline, according to the Washington Post. Bankruptcy 2: Trump Plaza Hotel, 1992 Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in New York for $390 million in 1988. By 1992, the hotel had accumulated $550 million in debt. As a result of the bankruptcy, in exchange for easier terms on which to pay off the debts, Trump relinquished a 49 percent stake in the Plaza to a total of six lenders, according to ABC News. Trump remained the hotel\u2019s CEO, but it was merely a gesture -- he didn\u2019t earn a salary and had no say in the hotel\u2019s day-to-day operations, according to the New York Times. Bankruptcy 3: Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, 2004 Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004 when his casinos -- including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City and a riverboat casino in Indiana -- had accrued an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to the Associated Press. Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he was still the company\u2019s largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that the company represented less than 1 percent of his net worth. Bankruptcy 4: Trump Entertainment Resorts, 2009 Trump Entertainment Resorts -- formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts --was hit hard by the 2008 economic recession and missed a $53.1 million bond interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News. After debating with the company\u2019s board of directors, Trump resigned as the company\u2019s chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trump\u2019s name in licensing. So four Trump companies filed for Chapter 11 reorganization. Is that as big a deal as Fiorina says? Risky business While it would be better to avoid a situation where Chapter 11 reorganization is necessary, filing for bankruptcy can be a \"sound business decision\" when the company is facing serious financial problems, Venditto said. It\u2019s better than the business shutting down completely. \"However, the source of the financial problems varies from case to case,\" he said. \"Sometimes it is the result of circumstances beyond the control of the business. Sometime it caused by poor judgment. More frequently, it is a combination.\" Trump\u2019s four bankruptcies all happened within the past 25 years. That\u2019s a lot, said Stephen Lubben, a leading expert in corporate finance and professor at Seton Hall School of Law. But to be fair, the gaming industry has been struggling the past few years, he added, and three out of four of Trump\u2019s bankruptcies were tied to casinos. It\u2019s not fair to put all the blame on Trump for the four bankruptcies because he\u2019s acting as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, said Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University. He added that people typically wouldn\u2019t personally blame former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney or investor Warren Buffett for individual failures within their investment companies, Bain Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, respectively. \"The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space,\" Levitan said. \"These bankruptcies were not defining moments for Trump and shouldn't color our view of him.\""

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it is appropriate to label Harry Reid's claim that Mitt Romney did not pay taxes for 10 years as False. The article provides several reasons why this claim is unlikely to be true:\n\nFirstly, according to an IRS study of nearly 4 million 2009 tax returns of filers reporting more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, only 0.529 percent had no U.S. income tax liability. This suggests that it is unlikely for Romney to have paid zero taxes for an extended period of time.\n\nSecondly, the article notes that Romney's recent income has been substantially higher than $200,000, which means that the size of his deductions and credits would need to be even larger than those of the filers included in the IRS study if his tax liability was going to fall to zero.\n\nThirdly, the article quotes two tax experts who conclude that it is highly unlikely that Romney paid nothing in taxes for 10 years. They note that while it's possible he paid very little in taxes, it's hard to believe he paid none.\n\nFinally, the article mentions that Romney released an estimate of his 2011 taxes, which showed income of $20.9 million and a tax payment of $3.2 million. This suggests that he has been paying taxes in recent years, which further undermines the claim that he did not pay any taxes for 10 years.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is unlikely that Romney did not pay taxes for 10 years, and therefore Harry Reid's claim should be labeled as False.",
    "doc": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., touched off a firestorm last week after he claimed that an unnamed investor in Mitt Romney\u2019s company, Bain Capital, told him that Romney hadn\u2019t paid any taxes for 10 years. In a July 31, 2012, interview with the Huffington Post, Reid attacked Romney for refusing to publicly release tax returns prior to 2010. Reid said, \"His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son,\" referring to George Romney's decision to release 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late 1960s. Reid told the website that about a month earlier, a person who had invested with Bain Capital called his office and said, \"Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years.\" Reid continued, \"He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain,\" said Reid. \"But obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look? \u2026 You guys have said his wealth is $250 million. Not a chance in the world. It's a lot more than that. I mean, you do pretty well if you don't pay taxes for 10 years when you're making millions and millions of dollars.\" On Aug. 2, Reid repeated the allegation on the Senate floor, saying, \"As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a person coming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet officer, he couldn't be if he had the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns. So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove he has paid taxes, because he has not.\" And later that day, Reid tripled down on the accusation, releasing a statement that said in part, \"I was told by an extremely credible source that Romney has not paid taxes for 10 years.\" Romney and his allies pushed back hard against the accusation, saying it was not only substantively incorrect but also ethically out of bounds. \"Harry Reid really has to put up or shut up,\" Romney said following a speech in North Las Vegas, Nev., according to CBS News. Romney added, \"Let me also say, categorically, I have paid taxes every year -- and a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong. And that is why I am so anxious for him to give us the names of the people who put this forward. I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear the names are people from the White House or the Obama campaign.\" Other Republicans leaped to Romney\u2019s defense, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., (who told CNN\u2019s State of the Union that \"I think he\u2019s lying\") and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who called Reid a \"dirty liar\" on ABC\u2019s This Week. Outside commentators, including liberals, have slammed Reid as well. The New York Times\u2019 Frank Bruni called Reid\u2019s charges part of an \"unbecoming, corrosive game.\" \"Spew first and sweat the details later, or never,\" Bruni wrote. \"Speak loosely and carry a stick-thin collection of backup materials, or none at all. That\u2019s the M.O. of the moment, familiar from the past but in particularly galling and profuse flower of late.\" Many readers asked us to put Reid\u2019s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. We conclude that Reid, despite repeating the claim on at least two occasions, has not produced any solid evidence it is true. An anonymous source? On Aug. 6, a Reid spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that the majority leader still maintains the information came from the anonymous Bain investor. Our Truth-O-Meter guidelines say we hold officials accountable to back up their words. By those standards, Reid has not proven his allegation. Still, we wondered how likely it was that Romney didn\u2019t pay taxes for 10 years. In an Internal Revenue Service study of nearly 4 million 2009 tax returns of filers reporting more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, 20,752 of these taxpayers -- or just 0.529 percent -- had no U.S. income tax liability. About half of those did have income tax liability in other countries. But Romney\u2019s recent income has been substantially higher than $200,000, meaning that the size of his deductions and credits would need to be even larger than for many of those included in this IRS study if his tax liability was going to fall to zero. According to the one full return he\u2019s released, for tax year 2010, he and his wife Ann reported an adjusted gross income of $21.6 million and paid taxes of about $3 million. He's also released an estimate of his 2011 taxes, which showed income of $20.9 million and a tax payment of $3.2 million. To gauge tax patterns for even higher-income earners, the best we can do is to look at another IRS study detailing the taxes paid by the top 400 earners in the nation in 2008. To make this list, you would have to have earned roughly $109 million that year. Among those 400 top taxpayers, 30 -- or 7.5 percent -- had an effective tax rate of between 0 and 10 percent. Given how the statistics are calculated, it\u2019s impossible to know how many paid no taxes, but it\u2019s safe to assume it\u2019s well below 7.5 percent. Neither study directly addresses Romney\u2019s situation -- he falls somewhere in the middle of the two studies -- but the data does show that for earners both below and above him, it's unlikely they paid zero taxes for one year, and it\u2019s even more far-fetched to think they did so for 10 years. Salon.com -- which is generally considered a liberal media outlet, thus no friend to Romney -- asked two tax experts whether they thought it was likely that Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. They concluded, \"probably not.\" The article quoted David Miller, a tax attorney with the firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York, saying it\u2019s \"highly unlikely\" that he paid nothing. \"It would be easier for someone like Steve Jobs to pay zero, as most of his wealth was in company stock, which isn\u2019t taxed until sold and may never be sold,\" Miller told Salon. The Salon article continued, \"But Romney\u2019s arrangement with Bain is different. He would have earned management fees, and when Bain sold the underlying companies that it invested in, Romney would have been subject to tax on his share. 'It\u2019s possible he paid very little in taxes, but I find it hard to believe that he paid none,' Miller said.\" Salon also quoted Joshua Kamerman, a lawyer and CPA in New York, who said while it\u2019s theoretically possible, it\u2019s also \"preposterous.\" \"Charitable donations can shield up to only 50 percent of tax liability, while other means can lower the rate,\" the article said. \"But to pay nothing, Romney would have to sustain business operating losses, Kamerman said. The IRS lets people carry over losses for up to 20 years until they make a profit from which to deduct them. But Kamerman said this is almost certainly not the case for Romney.\" We asked Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, for his view, and he concurred with Miller and Kamerman. \"I agree that it's extremely unlikely that Mr. Romney paid no income taxes for 10 years,\" White said."

    "claim": "Kelly Ayotte \"has voted to defund Planned Parenthood\" six times.",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it can be concluded that Kelly Ayotte has indeed voted to defund Planned Parenthood six times. The article provides specific votes taken by Ayotte in 2015 and 2011, including a bill to block federal funding to Planned Parenthood, an amendment to strip a provision from the bill that would have provided federal funding to Planned Parenthood, and a resolution to prohibit federal dollars from funding Planned Parenthood. While some of these votes were procedural or did not offer a clean up-or-down funding decision, the overall pattern of Ayotte's votes shows consistent opposition to funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is accurate to label Kelly Ayotte as having voted to defund Planned Parenthood six times.",
    "doc": "Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces a competitive reelection bid in New Hampshire and Democrats are already taking aim at her record on abortion and women\u2019s health. Gov. Maggie Hassan, the only Democratic candidate in the race, is one of the latest to lob those criticisms. \"She has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, which provides healthcare to about 12,000 Granite State women,\" Hassan said in a recent interview with the Concord Monitor, referring to Ayotte. \"She\u2019s voted to defund them six times.\" Planned Parenthood, a women\u2019s health care provider that also offers abortions, has become a lightning rod in recent years as elected officials in Washington and in New Hampshire have taken steps to cut the organization\u2019s funding. The organization is no fan of Ayotte: Planned Parenthood\u2019s political arm took out its first ad of the 2016 cycle this month targeting New Hampshire\u2019s junior Senator. We decided to take a closer look at Hassan\u2019s claim. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England runs five health centers across New Hampshire -- in Manchester, Claremont, Derry, Exeter and Keene. And roughly half of the patients who visit a Planned Parenthood clinic across the border in Vermont -- in White River Junction -- are from New Hampshire. The Planned Parenthood centers in New Hampshire all provide contraception, annual exams, STI testing and treatment, and pregnancy testing. The Manchester location, which saw 4,779 patients in 2014, provides surgical and medical abortions. The Keene location, visited by 1,871 patients in 2014, offers medication abortions, according to Kayla McCarthy, with Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. Altogether Planned Parenthood clinics in New Hampshire served just over 11,000 patients during 2014, according according to Vice President for Public Policy Jennifer Frizzell. Another 1,750 were seen in the White River Junction, VT clinic. That would mean Planned Parenthood clinics together saw roughly 12,000 New Hampshire patients in 2014, in line with Hassan\u2019s claim. Now let\u2019s look at how many times Ayotte has voted against Planned Parenthood funding. Ayotte, elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, has been a consistent opponent of abortion and critic of Planned Parenthood. We checked with Hassan\u2019s campaign and they pointed us to six votes. Three votes took place all on the same day, Dec. 3, 2015. 1) That day the Senate voted 52-47 to block federal funding to Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act in one bill. Ayotte voted for it. 2) Ayotte voted against an amendment that would have stripped a provision from the bill to defund Planned Parenthood. (The amendment was defeated.) 3) Another amendment, proposed by Democrats, sought to continue federal funding for Planned Parenthood, but it was tabled (that is, set aside) and Ayotte voted in favor of tabling it. (President Obama ultimately vetoed the bill.) 4) Ayotte voted to advance a bill last August that sought to prohibit federal funding for Planned Parenthood. But the legislation failed to get the 60 votes it needed to move forward. 5) Ayotte voted in April 2011 for a resolution to prohibit federal dollars from funding Planned Parenthood. It failed, 42 to 58. 6) And in March 2011 Ayotte voted for a bill to fund the federal government, that included dozens of other spending items, but blocked federal funding to Planned Parenthood. The bill failed, 44 to 56. Ayotte said at the time: \"Our country is in a fiscal crisis\u2026 Everyone is going to have to make sacrifices, including many private organizations that have relied on federal resources,\" according to her office. In all, these six votes show some level opposition to funding for Planned Parenthood. However, some of them were procedural, and not all offered a clean up-or-down funding decision, as Hassan\u2019s statement suggests. Ayotte\u2019s office said she supported several other government spending bills that did not defund Planned Parenthood. And in September 2015, Ayotte voted not to move forward with a temporary government spending bill that sought to block federal funds for Planned Parenthood. Ayotte said at the time she supported defunding Planned Parenthood, but didn\u2019t want to shut the government down to do it. \"Kelly Ayotte has voted to direct federal funding away from Planned Parenthood in an effort to better use federal dollars to fill gaps in women's health services for low-income women and preserve access to women\u2019s health services,\" spokeswoman Liz Johnson said."

    "claim": "Says a young Texas rapper charged with capital crimes faces the death penalty but the alleged Santa Fe High School shooter faces prison and then parole after 40 years.",
    "taxonomy_label": "interval",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that the young Texas rapper faces the death penalty while the Santa Fe High School shooter faces prison and then parole after 40 years is false. The Supreme Court ruling in Roper vs. Simmons (2005) prohibits the execution of juveniles under the age of 18, making it impossible for the rapper to face the death penalty. According to Section 8.07(c) of Texas' penal code, no person can be punished by death for an offense committed while they were younger than 18 years old. Additionally, legislative action in response to a Supreme Court ruling in Miller v. Alabama (2012) mandated that all juveniles convicted of capital offenses be sentenced to prison for 40 calendar years before qualifying for consideration for parole. However, Texas law solely permits juveniles sentenced to life in prison to apply for parole after 40 years, and does not guarantee automatic parole. Therefore, the rapper cannot face the death penalty and will have to serve at least 40 years in prison before being eligible for parole.",
    "doc": "A U.S. Supreme Court ruling keeps the admitted shooter in a Santa Fe, Texas, school from facing the death penalty. Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, would have had to be 18 to qualify. Still, a meme brought to our attention by readers suggests he's getting a special lift up. The meme shows an African-American 17-year-old Texas rapper, Taymore \"Tay-K 47\" McIntyre, and says that he faces the death penalty if convicted of capital charges pending against him. Meantime, the meme says, Pagourtzis--who admitted to the May 18, 2018, mass shooting at Santa Fe High School that killed 10 and wounded at least 10 others, according to court documents--faces no death penalty plus \"parole in 40 years.\" Rapper T.I. recently shared the meme on his Instagram, saying, \"So the question is how is the D.A. seeking the death penalty for Tay K & not the other guy?\" T.I. went on to note that McIntyre is a minor, like Pagourtzis. They\u2019re \"the same age!!!!!!,\" T.I. wrote. According to a May 10, 2018, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story, McIntyre has been charged in two capital murders \u2014 one in Mansfield and one in San Antonio \u2014 as well as in an aggravated robbery that left an Arlington, Texas, man seriously injured. The story said he remained in jail. After the Santa Fe shootings, the Houston Chronicle, a Houston TV station and the Star-Telegram each declared that the disparity for capital crime convictions suggested by the meme lacks factual footing because of the 2005 Supreme Court ruling. To get our fix on the meme\u2019s accuracy, we turned first to the court decision. Supreme Court acts On March 1, 2005, the court held by 5-4 that the Constitution\u2019s bar on cruel and unusual punishment means the death penalty could no longer be imposed on juvenile offenders under 18. The Eighth Amendment provides: \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\" The ruling, in Roper vs. Simmons, stemmed in part, the majority wrote, from 30 states already prohibiting the juvenile death penalty. The ruling removed 72 people from death rows in a dozen states, according to a March 2005 news story in the New York Times, and \"represented an about-face for a court that only 16 years ago rejected the argument that the execution of those who kill at the age of 16 or 17 violated\" the constitutional bar on cruel and unusual punishments. By phone, Sarah Guidry, who directs the Earl Call Institute for Legal and Social Policy at Texas Southern University\u2019s Thurgood Marshall School of Law, said that after the high court acted, Texas lawmakers amended state law. Section 8.07(c) of the state\u2019s penal code states: \"No person may, in any case, be punished by death for an offense committed while the person was younger than 18 years.\" Before the Supreme Court ruled, Texas was among 12 states with juveniles on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that compiles information and statistics about the death penalty. From 1976 until the court acted, the center says, 22 defendants were executed for crimes committed as juveniles. By phone, the center\u2019s Robert Dunham told us 13 of the death penalties were carried out in Texas. Dunham, calling the meme false, said the Roper ruling left no room for states to sentence to death any individuals younger than 18 at the time of their crimes. By phone, Texas state senators versed in criminal justice told us the court\u2019s ruling in Roper means no juvenile can be sentenced to death. Sen. Juan \"Chuy\" Hinojosa, D-McAllen, said the ruling \"changed the lay of the land when it came to the death penalty and juveniles.\" Parole in 40 years? Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, vice chair of the Senate Committee on Criminal Justice, said state law otherwise backs up the meme\u2019s indication that Pagourtzis could be imprisoned yet paroled after 40 years. That's so, she said,thanks to legislative action in the wake of a June 2012 Supreme Court ruling. The majority opinion in Miller v. Alabamastates: \"By requiring that all children convicted of homicide receive lifetime incarceration without possibility of parole, regardless of their age and age-related characteristics and the nature of their crimes, the mandatory sentencing schemes before us violate this principle of proportionality, and so the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\" In 2013, Texas lawmakers reacted to the ruling by passinginto law a measure mandating that all juveniles convicted of capital offenses be sentenced to prison for 40 calendar years before qualifying for consideration for parole. Previously, juveniles 17 to 18 convicted of capital offenses faced life-without-parole sentences. We asked Dunham to speak to the parole part of the meme. He cautioned that Texas law solely permits juveniles sentenced to life in prison to apply for parole after 40 years; the lawdoesn\u2019t say anyone automatically gets paroled. Summing up, Dunham said: \"If you are age 17, the most you can get for capital murder in Texas is life with the possibility of parole after 40 years.\""

However, the evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim. According to the inspector general's report, 72 of the 298 groups selected for special scrutiny had \"tea party\" in their title, 13 had \"patriot,\" and 11 had \"9/12.\" This adds up to 96 groups, or 32.2% of the total number of groups. The article does not provide information on the political views of the remaining 202 groups, but it is clear that a significant proportion of them were conservative.\n\nFurthermore, the acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller confirmed during Congressional hearings that the criteria used by IRS employees to identify groups for scrutiny included broad descriptions such as \"educating Americans about the Constitution,\" which is a stated goal of the 9/12 Project, an activist organization founded by conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck. This suggests that the IRS was targeting groups with conservative views, rather than non-conservative groups as the claim suggests.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim \"Says two-thirds of groups targeted for IRS scrutiny were not conservative\" is false, and that a significant proportion of the groups targeted by the IRS were conservative.",
    "doc": "Amid fallout from the IRS\u2019s admission that it improperly targeted conservative groups, Democratic-leaning Progress Texas suggested the agency\u2019s net was cast wider, tweeting that \"2/3 of groups scrutinized were not conservatives.\" That May 31, 2013, statement wasn\u2019t the first time the nonprofit advocacy group made such a claim; a May 17 post on its website said, \"Two-thirds of those groups that received extra scrutiny from the IRS were not conservative.\" Context: The IRS apologized May 10, 2013, for singling out tax-exemption applications from groups whose names included \"tea party,\" \"patriot\" or \"9/12.\" The organizations were seeking exemption from federal taxes either as charitable groups with IRS designation 501(c)3 or as social welfare groups, which are allowed to engage in limited political activity without disclosing donors, under IRS designation 501(c)4. Since then, groups of varied political stripes including Progress Texas have spoken up to say their own applications drew extra scrutiny. We asked how Progress Texas concluded that most of the groups were not conservative. Political director Phillip Martin told us by email that the statement was based on a May 12, 2013, Washington Post news story about a leaked report from the U.S. Treasury inspector general that the government released two days later. The Post story said that according to the report, \"Of the 298 groups selected for special scrutiny ... 72 had \u2018tea party\u2019 in their title, 13 had \u2018patriot\u2019 and 11 had \u20189/12.\u2019 \" That equaled 96 groups, Martin said, or 32.2 percent of the declared 298. Were the other 202 groups nonconservative? Neither the report nor the story described those groups, and Progress Texas did not reply to our follow-up requests for relevant information. The IRS said in a May 15, 2013, press release that the groups without \"tea party\" in their names \"included organizations of all political views.\" Precisely what happened from May 2010 through May 2012 at the agency\u2019s Cincinnati, Ohio, office, where all such tax-exemption applications are processed, has not become clear. But according to the inspector general\u2019s report, IRS workers were instructed to look for indications of applicants\u2019 political views and activities, including some broad descriptions but also others aimed at conservatives. For instance, the report says staffers were asked to flag groups educating Americans about the Constitution, which is a stated goal of the 9/12 Project, an activist organization founded by conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck. According to the report, the IRS criteria included: In U.S. House hearings May 17 and 22, 2013, lawmakers questioned acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller and the Treasury\u2019s inspector general, J. Russell George, about the 202 unlabeled groups. On May 22, Miller said that \"202 non-Tea Party cases... were reviewed for indications of significant political campaign intervention, which was our key criteria,\" helping to determine whether a group\u2019s activities affected its eligibility for the 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) designations. \"We did not evaluate whether or not they were conservative groups, or -- or progressive groups, or liberal groups, or whatever term you want to use,\" Miller said. Asked May 17 whether liberal buzz words such as \"progressive\" or \"organizing\" also were used to identify groups for scrutiny, Miller said they were not. IRS employees, Miller said May 17, were grouping similar applications together for efficiency. The method they used, he said, \"while intolerable, was a mistake and not an act of partisanship.\" George said his report did not break out the political makeup of the 202 groups because it looked only at the names of the organizations: \"Certain names were so generic that we were unable to determine whether or not they had a particular point of view.\" A full breakdown of the scrutinized groups, or even types of groups, might not surface. On May 20, 2013, Senate Finance Committee leaders asked the IRS for information including the names of the 298 targeted groups; they had not received the names as of June 6, 2013, committee spokeswoman Julia Lawless told us via email."

Republican State Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez claimed in a press release and on Twitter on May 11, 2017 that a large chunk will be siphoned off for anything but roads. \"Governor Brown and his fellow Democrats are already diverting funding to their own pet projects,\" she said in the press release. \"In this budget proposal, they are diverting 30 percent of funding from the gas tax to non-road related projects like building parks and job training for felons. That\u2019s money from the very gas tax the Democrats promised would go solely to fixing our decrepit roads and providing relief for traffic congestion.\" The gas tax increase is part of a larger transportation funding legislation signed by Brown in April 2017. In common speech, some politicians simply call this \"the gas tax.\" It includes an initial 12 cent per gallon gas tax increase that starts in November; a diesel tax hike; and a new \"transportation improvement fee\" ranging from $25 to $175 per year, depending on the value of one\u2019s vehicle. We wrote about how this new tax will affect the state's already high gas tax rate hereand gas prices here. It passed the Legislature with the help of Democrats and one Republican state senator. Melendez, who represents Riverside County, strongly opposed it. There\u2019s no doubt roads are the main focus of the funding package. The measure was even called The Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017. We decided to examine two key parts of Melendez\u2019s claim: Did Brown\u2019s budget \u2018divert\u2019 30 percent of the transportation funding? And was this money being siphoned off for \u2018non-road\u2019 related projects? We buckled up for a fact check. Our research Melendez\u2019s spokesman Sam Spencer showed us a chart in the governor\u2019s revised May budget that he said backs up the claim. It shows proposals for spending $2.8 billion of the new transportation revenue in the next fiscal year on various programs. Local streets and roads would get $445 million; bridges and culverts would receive $400 million and congested corridors would get $250 million. Spencer highlighted other categories he said \"are clearly not programs intended to fix our crumbling roads.\" Those, Spencer said, include rail, transit, active transportation such as bikeways and pedestrian paths, parks and recreation, food and agriculture, university research and workforce development programs. Brown\u2019s budget calls for spending $818.7 million on those. That\u2019s about 29 percent of the overall $2.8 billion in new funding from the transportation package. It just about matches Melendez\u2019s claim that 30 percent of the new revenue is being set aside for what appear to be non-road projects. Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez's office said this chart from the governor's May budget backs up the claim. Response from Brown Administration We asked the governor\u2019s staff about Melendez\u2019s claim and about the categories that seem to have little to do with roads. Malcolm Dougherty, director of the California Department of Transportation, took issue with Melendez\u2019s characterization that the budget \"diverts\" any money from its intended purpose. \"The dollars are being used exactly the way SB 1 presented them,\" Dougherty said, referring to the number of the Senate transportation funding bill that was signed into law. \"The funding package was always intended to include transit and rail.\" Transit, rail and active transportation programs represent about one-quarter of the proposed new spending. Paul Golaszewski, who researches transportation funding at the nonpartisan California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office, agreed the governor\u2019s budget \"adheres to SB1.\" He also noted that in future years, the share of money devoted purely to road projects, increases under the state\u2019s funding plans. Why parks and job training? But that still leaves the question of why parks, universities, workforce and farm programs are getting any gas tax money. And whether those categories have anything to do with road projects. Dougherty, the Caltrans director, said that before SB1 was signed, existing laws required some gas tax revenue go to state parks and food and agriculture programs. Parks collect a portion of the tax on gasoline sales for off-road vehicles using the parks. Likewise, Dougherty said, food and agriculture programs get a slice of gas tax revenue when farmers purchase fuel for their vehicles, also under an existing law. Both laws remain in place after SB1. Dougherty added that the revenue for the parks and workforce training, the two categories cited by Melendez in her statement, represent less than 3 percent of the transportation revenue. The University of California and California State University systems will get a combined $7 million of the new revenue for what Dougherty called \"transportation related research.\" Finally, he said, the state\u2019s workforce development board will get $5 million to prepare workers for jobs created by the transportation spending. Melendez\u2019s spokesman pointed to a state workforce board budget document that proposes using that money for \"pre-apprenticeship training programs, focused on formerly incarcerated, women and minorities.\" SB 1 calls for the workforce board to create those programs. It also authorized the money for the universities."

Therefore, it is plausible that a student working a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay for tuition only, which would be $688 in this case.\n\nThe meme's wording is the only notable failing, as it implies that the student could attend any university of their choice, when in fact the data refers to in-state tuition rates. However, this limitation does not affect the overall accuracy of the claim.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the claim \"In 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year's full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice\" is True.",
    "doc": "Everything was better in the old days, apparently -- including the chore of paying for college, at least according to a social media meme sent to us recently by a reader. The meme -- created by OurTime.org, an advocacy group for young Americans -- said, \"In 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year's full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice.\" Really? We figured this was worth a look. First, the minimum wage. Starting on Jan. 1, 1978, the minimum wage was $2.65. Someone working at the minimum wage for 13 weeks, and 40 hours per week, in the summer of 1978 would have ended up with $1,378 for their labors. For the tuition they would have faced in the 1978-79 school year, we turned to figures from the National Center for Education Statistics, the federal government\u2019s repository of education data. The cost of tuition and fees (in that year\u2019s dollars, not adjusted for inflation) was $688 for in-state residents attending a four-year, public university. So the meme\u2019s claim is correct except for a few caveats -- two minor and one more significant: \u2022 The cost of tuition and fees plus room and board was significantly higher that year -- $2,145 -- but the meme was careful to cite \"tuition\" only, so we\u2019ll ignore the impact of room and board. \u2022 The tuition-and-fees figure we used is a national average, so some states may have had in-state tuition rates out of reach of minimum wage workers. \u2022 The meme\u2019s only notable failing has to do with overly broad wording -- specifically its use of the phrase \"of their choice.\" The data we used refers to in-state tuition, meaning that the student would have access to this sweet tuition rate only at their home-state university. That\u2019s not the same thing as \"of their choice.\""

Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.",
    "doc": "Anything that has to do with jobs captures the scribes\u2019 eyes here at PolitiFact Georgia. And it was an eye-popping number of jobs that the American Petroleum Institute attributed to the oil and gas industry in a recent press release. \"The oil and natural gas industry provides or supports 141,600 jobs in Georgia,\" according to the blog posting designed to highlight the economic and job impact the energy industry has on the Peach State. This for a state that has yet to produce a single drop of commercially produced gas or oil, we wondered? The numbers The API cited a 2013 report that it commissioned, Economic Impacts of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry on the U.S. Economy in 2011, from PricewaterhouseCoopers. The report includes state-by-state breakdowns on how many jobs have been created, as well as the overall economic impact of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry. The analysis arrives at the 141,600 job estimate first with data from the U.S. bureaus of Economic Analysis and of Labor Statistics for a dozen job codes. The report breaks that job tally into three categories. It says 42,638 jobs were directly involved in the oil and natural gas industry. That includes the expected extraction and production jobs and \u2013 as we will get to in a moment \u2013 a total of 29,146 jobs at gas stations with and without convenience stores. If that were the only category, those jobs would account for just 0.8 percent of all Georgia jobs. But the report classifies another 33,502 workers as indirectly involved in the oil and gas industry, or with positions in activities in outside industries that supply those fields. Drew Lyon, principal and leader of the national economics and statistics group at PwC and the author of the report, said care was taken to eliminate double counts so that some suppliers who would have been in the direct jobs tally were removed. Then the largest number of jobs -- 65,490 -- are counted as \"induced\" jobs. Lyon said those are the positions that are created to meet the demand from the spending of employees in the direct and indirect jobs. In that category, the general \"service\" field has by far the most indirect and induced jobs, with 43,349 workers \u2013 or 711 more employees than work directly for the oil and natural gas industries. Considering those jobs are apt to be in professional services, healthcare, education and the like \u2013 all known powerhouses in metro Atlanta\u2019s economy -- those numbers are not surprising. And to Lyon, they show how many of those back office jobs -- say in human resources -- owe their existence to an industry thought of as minor in the Peach State. \"It\u2019s no surprise, for example, that a significant amount of employment in Texas is directly related to oil and gas,\" Lyon said. \"But it\u2019s of interest in how other states, either as suppliers to in-state or out-of-state producers, or through some of these other industries, are impacted by the oil and gas industry.\" Taken together, that brings the total to 141,600 jobs, or 2.7 percent of the Georgia workforce. But is it fair to count all of those jobs, knowing that two thirds of the positions in question are outside the oil and gas industries? Bruce Seaman, an economist at Georgia State\u2019s Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, said he was not troubled with the methodology of the study. The report took care not to count jobs twice and also used commonly accepted input-output models to show the known relationships between industries (Basically, the output from one industry become inputs in another but must be adjusted not to exaggerate the impact). That said, Seaman wondered about the service station employees, who primarily are not working as pump attendants or mechanics. Especially at stations with stores, those workers are apt to run the cash registers, do janitorial work or even cook. \"Those jobs are more accurately convenience store retail jobs,\" Seaman said. The BLS codes back up that assessment, listing those positions as retail, versus the mining or production jobs expected in oil and gas. Lyon said PwC included those gas station positions as a best estimate of companies and jobs that exist only because of the gas and oil industry. Reid Porter, a spokesman at API, agreed, adding \"What happens in the oil and natural gas industry reverberates throughout the entire economy.\""

    "doc": "Central Florida U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson is digging on some 1970s Led Zeppelin in his first ad attacking Republican opponent Daniel Webster.The ad is called \"Dan Webster's Stairway to Nowhere.\" See where this is going, Zeppelin fans?It opens with someone ripping off Jimmy Page's recognizable guitar introduction to \"Stairway to Heaven.\" A narrator talks over a black-and-white image of Webster, a longtime state legislator and former House speaker.\"When career politician Daniel Webster became speaker of the House, he wasted $32,000 of our money on a spiral staircase for his office,\" the narrator says, before moving on to a claim that he used tax money for private flights.The ad then finishes with a spin off of Robert Plant's vocals.\"And he's charged us for a stairway to nowhere.\"To be honest, it's a pretty poor rendition.But we're PolitiFact Florida, not American Idol, so we'll stick to the factual claims in the ad -- specifically about the stairwell.Stepping stones to the staircaseWebster was elected to the state House in 1980. In 1996, he became the first Republican state House speaker in more than 100 years after the GOP seized power.That also put him in charge of improvements and renovations to House offices and facilities. Each new speaker traditionally has made changes, upgrades, or renovations. In 1999, Speaker John Thrasher, now a state senator and chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, approved nearly $7 million for the House chamber -- now adorned in mahogany -- the Speaker's Office, and House office building.In 2002, leaders of the House and Senate spent about $1.5 million on furniture, structural changes, even a private bathroom. On the other hand, former Speaker Allan Bense spent only about $1,500 on changes in 2004, according to the St. Petersburg Times.According to newspaper accounts Webster spent about $100,000 in taxpayer dollars on improvements to House facilities in his first months as speaker, including $31,983 on a spiral staircase.The staircase connected the Republican Majority Office on the Capitol's third floor with the Speaker's Office above it on the fourth floor. The staircase was intended to make it easier to move back and forth between the two offices -- namely, it allowed legislators and Webster as speaker to avoid walking through the public hallways filled with lobbyists, reporters and members of the public. The staircase \"will allow us to better coordinate things between the Speaker's Office and the Majority Office,\" Webster said at the time. He also noted that he took the idea from Democrats, who previously had drawn up plans for a spiral staircase of their own. It was built in a spiral style because it was the only way it could work given the space. The Grayson ad includes an image of an elaborate white spiral staircase to help make its point about Webster. But that's not the Webster staircase, said Todd Reid, staff director for the Florida House Majority Office. The staircase was closed off in 2006 during more than $500,000 of renovations ordered by then-Speaker Marco Rubio. The stairway's fourth-floor landing became the new offices of the speaker's chief of staff. \"It was a standard black metal staircase,\" Reid said. \"It certainly wasn't heavy on the accouterments.\" Reid described the staircase as noisy and said whenever someone walked up or down it, people could hear the staircase rattling from both offices. He said the bottom half of the staircase remains in place; a closet was built around it. \"If you were in Tallahassee, I'd take you in to see it,\" Reid told PolitiFact Florida. Your humble fact-checker didn't have time to jump in a car for the five-hour trip to Tallahassee, but we were able to send the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald's Lee Logan for an exclusive tour. Cribs: Staircase to Nowhere-edition Logan filed the following report, complete with a picture. Behind a door labeled \"No Entry\" in the House Majority Office is the famed Webster staircase. The small closet without lights is used so rarely that Reid had to hunt down someone in the House Sergeant at Arms office to get a key to the door. The bottom half of the black spiral staircase is still bolted to the floor. (Stairs are simple black metal, with a black metal railing.) Pieces of the top half are also in the closet, including a large piece that rests on top of the lower portion.The ceiling of the closet is now covered over with concrete, forming the floor of the chief of staff's office on the fourth floor. Reid says it's unlikely the stairway would be re-installed because the fourth floor spot is \"prime real estate\" -- now the House speaker and his chief of staff have direct access to one another through a door.Before Rubio made the space into the chief of staff's office, the staircase came up through a hole in the floor and emptied into a common area that also housed a few supplies.Reid said the closet could be used for supplies if the stairs were removed. But he speculated that they weren't taken out because they're simply too big. Also, a speaker sometime in the future might find a use for the stairs.The stairs were used \"irregularly,\" Reid said, usually on peak days when the Capitol was crowded. He also recalled former Gov. Jeb Bush occasionally using the stairs.Currently, if a staffer (not Joe Public) wanted to go from the Majority Office to the Speaker's Office, he or she could go up a back stairwell and cut through the Member's Lounge, which requires a key card and is reserved for lawmakers. Speaker Larry Cretul has said staffers can cut through the area if they don't loiter or disturb the lawmakers."

Therefore, Yoest's specific claim about 1,270 infants who die after abortion procedures is unsubstantiated and likely exaggerated.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence provided also highlights that there is no federal requirement to report the number of infants born alive during an attempted abortions, which raises questions about the accuracy and reliability of any claimed figures. Therefore, Yoest's claim cannot be verified or substantiated based on the evidence provided.\n\nIn conclusion, based solely on the evidence provided, the claim made by Charmaine Yoest that \"In 2010 alone, 1,270 infants were reported to have died following attempted abortions\" is False.",
    "doc": "A bill requiring physicians to treat infants who survive abortion attempts is moving through the Legislature without the usual partisan fight, though some lawmakers have questioned whether it addresses an ongoing problem. An anti-abortion activist used a specific figure in a recent committee hearing to reassure lawmakers HB 1129/SB 1636 is necessary. \"The tragedy of infants born alive following attempted abortions is real,\" said Charmaine Yoest, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, on April 9. \"It is not the hypothetical that is sometimes reported. In 2010 alone, 1,270 infants were reported to have died following attempted abortions and notably that is only one year.\" Yoest said without elaborating there are two cases in Florida. After the meeting, reporters asked Yoest about the number she used. Yoest told them the figure came from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the CDC, which collects data from most state health departments on the number of legal induced abortions performed each year, does not collect data on infants who die after surviving abortion attempts. Neither does the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy group that supports women\u2019s access to abortions and collects abortion data. Neither Guttmacher nor the CDC has published its 2010 data for abortions. \"We have no idea where this number comes from,\" said Rebecca Wind, Guttmacher Institute spokeswoman. A committee analysis says there is no federal requirement to report the number of infants born alive during an attempted abortions. So Rep. Cary Pigman, R-Avon Park, included in his legislation a requirement for physicians who perform abortions in Florida to report cases of infants born alive to the state. \"If in two years time or four years time we find that there are zero cases, it\u2019s a prayer answered,\" Pigman said at an April 4 committee hearing of his bill. \"If we find in two years time that there\u2019s a half dozen cases a year, then we have some issues.\" If there are no statistics or reporting requirements, where did Americans United for Life find this figure? We dug in. Twenty-eight states have laws protecting infants born alive. \"Infants Born Alive\" mirrors a federal law signed by President George W. Bush in 2002. Supporters say it is necessary to enact a state law so there is no doubt that an infant \"born alive\" -- defined as an infant who breathes or has heartbeats or muscle movements, regardless of whether the extraction method was natural or induced -- must be taken to a hospital for treatment appropriate for gestation age. A failed abortion could result in a live birth in a late-term abortion, which can only be performed if two physicians agree the mother's life is at risk, or if the mother was further into her pregnancy than thought. Physicians under the Florida proposal would have to provide medical care for an infant born alive after an abortion or face a first-degree misdemeanor charge. Pigman, an emergency physician, has referenced similar or exact figures as Yoest in committee hearings, but he characterized them differently and stressed the lack of exact data. In the bill\u2019s first hearing, Pigman mentioned CDC data on deaths for infants from 22 weeks of gestation to seven days after birth called \"other perinatal conditions.\" This category -- which totaled 1,270 deaths in 2010 -- is further broken down into categories of international medical codes for causes of death, including cardiovascular disorders (838 deaths), digestive system disorders (92 deaths), undefined cerebral problems (183 deaths) and \"other conditions originating in the perinatal period\" (130 deaths). \"I don\u2019t know which portion of that 1,270 were due to abortions or some other rare circumstances,\" Pigman said in the April 4 committee. Inside that latter subcategory -- \"other conditions originating in the perinatal period\" -- is a designation called \"termination of pregnancy, affecting fetus and newborn.\" The CDC doesn\u2019t have numbers for that designation for 2010 yet. In 2008, the CDC reported 33 deaths using that designation. Whether the abortion was elective or performed to save the life of the mother is unclear. Americans United for Life spokeswoman Kristi Hamrick said any number is problematic because abortion data is always incomplete. California, for instance, is one of a few states that does not report the number of abortion procedures that happen there. Hamrick directed us to a blog post written by the group's legal team about limited CDC data and anecdotal evidence of infants born alive, including two Florida cases of infants surviving abortion procedures (one died, one survived with catastrophic injuries) and the trial of Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell. The post does not support Yoest's specific claim about 1,270 infants who die after abortion procedures, offering instead the more nuanced breakdown for the 1,270 figure that we heard from Pigman."

The evidence shows that Hernandez has not restricted the flow of information about inmate-immigrants as intimated by Abbott, and her policy complies with 8 USC 1373.\n\nFirstly, the evidence states that Hernandez's policy does not restrict the flow of information about inmates to or from federal agencies, including ICE. According to Priddy, the Travis County official overseeing the county\u2019s correctional complex, each suspect booked into the jail continues to be fingerprinted, and the identifying characteristics of more than 4.8 million individuals are stored in the Automated Fingerprint Information System. This means that ICE agents can continue to contact the department directly about an inmate, for instance seeking to interview a jailed individual subject to an ongoing investigation.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that Hernandez's policy allows ICE to interview inmates and provides them with information on their requests, just as it does with any other agency. This contradicts Governor Abbott's claim that Hernandez is refusing to enforce 8 USC 1373 by limiting the flow of information about inmate-immigrants.\n\nThirdly, immigration experts consulted in the article agree that Hernandez's policy complies with the intent of 8 USC 1373. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for less immigration, suggests that the sheriff's policy against employees inquiring into immigration status or providing information on a person's release date or address conflicts with the intent of the statute noted by Abbott. However, Lena Graber, an attorney with the San Francisco-based Immigrant Legal Resource Center, argues that the sheriff's policy is limited to limiting detainer requests honored by the department and doesn't extend to restricting information flow, which would conflict with 8 USC 1373.\n\nFinally, the evidence shows that Hernandez revised her policy to clarify that nothing in it prohibits or restricts sending information to or requesting or receiving information from ICE regarding an individual's immigration or citizenship status. This further undermines Governor Abbott's claim that Hernandez is refusing to enforce 8 USC 1373.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that Governor Greg Abbott's claim that Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez is refusing to enforce 8 USC 1373 is False.

    "doc": "Greg Abbott, who shut off about $1.5 million in grants to Travis County out of concern that the county\u2019s Democratic officials unduly shield unauthorized immigrants, subsequently accused the local sheriff of breaking a federal law. The Republican governor said in a Feb. 6, 2017, tweet: \"Sheriff violates oath by refusing to enforce 8 USC 1373 & not giving ICE info about drugs cartels & armed robbers.\" ICE is Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that focuses on battling the illegal movement of people and trade. Abbott didn\u2019t offer factual back-up for his charge. Separately, Wes Priddy of the sheriff\u2019s department told us by phone there\u2019s been no change in operations that would violate the cited law. \"I don\u2019t know where the governor is getting his information or his point of view. I suspect it\u2019s just conjecture,\" Priddy said. Let\u2019s recap the federal provisions singled out by Abbott before getting to the policy put in place by Sheriff Sally Hernandez and whether she\u2019s not enforcing the law. Federal law Abbott did not single out any law pertaining to local police agencies accepting or refusing \"detainer\" requests from federal authorities seeking a hold on inmates so agents can consider them for deportation. Instead, the governor\u2019s tweet refers to a 216-word law that\u2019s focused on easing the flow of information between federal immigration authorities and local law agencies. Titled \"Communication between government agencies and the Immigration and Naturalization Service,\" the 1990s law bars federal, state or local agencies or officials from restricting any agency or official from sending to, or receiving from, federal immigration authorities \"information regarding the citizenship status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.\" Also, the law bars any person or agency from restricting another government entity from sending, requesting, receiving or maintaining information about any individual\u2019s immigration status or exchanging such information with a government entity. Travis County policy We don\u2019t know why Abbott concluded Hernandez isn\u2019t enforcing those provisions. He didn\u2019t say and an aide, Matt Hirsch, didn\u2019t reply to our inquiry. But Abbott posted his tweet about three hours after a commentary piece by Hernandez was posted by the Austin American-Statesman. In the commentary, Hernandez, a Democrat elected sheriff in November 2016, defended her policy of not automatically honoring every federal request to detain immigrant inmates for up to 48 hours\u2014with the exception of inmates charged with murder, aggravated sexual assault or human trafficking or if agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant. Other inmates, she said, would be allowed to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status. Hernandez wrote: \"Our policies at the Travis County sheriff\u2019s office are centered on all legal statutes and principles that are applicable to all. We proudly stand by our Constitution and our laws and plan to continue doing so. We will also continue to legally comply with\" ICE, she wrote. A few days later, Hernandez posted a statement on the office\u2019s website saying in part: \"I am following all state and federal laws, and upholding constitutional rights to due process for all in our criminal justice system. Our community is safer when people can report crimes without fear of deportation. I trust the court system and our judges to assess the risks and set appropriate bonds and conditions for all who are incarcerated.\" Travis County official We asked Priddy, who oversees the county\u2019s correctional complex,if thenew policy restricts the flow of information about inmate-immigrants as intimated by Abbott. Priddy told us there\u2019s been no change in the flow of each inmate\u2019s vital information to other law enforcement agencies including ICE. That is, Priddy said, each suspect booked into the jail continues to be fingerprinted and that information along with the person\u2019s name and date of birth is conveyed electronically to the Texas Department of Public Safety and then, he said, to federal agencies including ICE, whose officers can then determine if a suspect merits their attention. According to the DPS, its Automated Fingerprint Information System stores the identifying characteristics of more than 4.8 million individuals. Also, Priddy said, ICE agents can continue to contact the department directly about an inmate, for instance seeking to interview a jailed individual subject to an ongoing investigation. \"If so, we share and allow,\" Priddy said, though he said ICE officers don\u2019t have unfettered access to inmates in the jail\u2019s intake area, which they once did. \"We are complying\" with 8 USC 1373, Priddy said, adding: \"We are allowing ICE the opportunity to interview inmates; we are providing them information on their requests, just as we are with any other agency.\" We noticed, though,the sheriff\u2019s policy includes a provision that seemingly could fetter information flow. It states that sheriff\u2019s office \"officials shall not conduct or initiate any immigration status investigation into individuals in TCSO custody or provide information on an inmate\u2019s release date or address to ICE.\" Asked about that, Priddy said by email: \"The segments you are referring to are there to ensure TCSO staff do not conduct their own investigation regarding someone\u2019s immigration status. Information regarding citizenship or immigration status is readily shared with ICE upon that agency\u2019s request.\" ICE focuses on detainers Next, we asked an ICE spokeswoman, Nina Pruneda, to evaluate Abbott\u2019s claim. Prunedo, by email, sent an agency statement that didn\u2019t touch on any law explicitly: \"ICE would welcome any changes to current policy that would allow local authorities to more fully cooperate with ICE toward achieving the shared goal of protecting public safety and national security while balancing important community policing needs,\" ICE said.\"When law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders onto the streets, it undermines ICE\u2019s ability to protect public safety and carry out its mission,\" ICE said. Immigration experts We also asked immigration experts from different vantage points about the accuracy of Abbott\u2019s claim. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for less immigration, suggested the sheriff\u2019s policy against employees inquiring into immigration status or providing information on a person\u2019s release date or address conflicts with the intent of the statute noted by Abbott. By email, Vaughan pointed out a 2016 Justice Department memo that led us to an explanation of 8 USC 1373 by the Republican-majority House Judiciary Committee. That 1996 explanation says the panel\u2019s intent was to \"give state and local officials the authority to communicate with the INS regarding the presence, whereabouts and activities of illegal aliens.\" (After 9/11, Congress dissolved the Immigration and Naturalization Service with ICE assuming some of its duties.) \"This section,\" the committee said, \"is designed to prevent any state or local law, ordinance, executive order, policy, constitutional provision or decision of any federal or state court that prohibits or in any way restricts any communication between state and local officials and the INS.\" We also heard back from Lena Graber, an attorney with the San Francisco-based Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which has as its mission working with and educating immigrants, community organizations and the legal sector to continue to build a democratic society that values diversity and the rights of all people. Generally, Graber commented by email, the sheriff\u2019s policy is limited to limiting detainer requests honored by the department and doesn\u2019t extend to restricting information flow, which would conflict with the law highlighted by Abbott, she said. Sheriff revised policy Graber also underscored a section of the sheriff\u2019s policy that wasn\u2019t initially there, we noticed. The added section, point No. 10 in the policy, tracks with 8 USC 1373, stating: \"This policy in no way prohibits or restricts sending information to or requesting or receiving information from ICE regarding an individual\u2019s immigration or citizenship status, and nothing in this policy shall be construed to prohibit or restrict TCSO personnel from exchanging information regarding the immigration or citizenship status of any individual with ICE.\" We asked the sheriff\u2019s office why the section was added. By email, spokeswoman Kristen Dark replied that the provision was added Jan. 31, 2017 \"in the interest of clarity.\" Simultaneously, Dark wrote, another part of the policy was expanded, in part with: \"Information regarding incarceration status of inmates is available on the TCSO website. Information regarding court dates is available on the Travis County Courts\u2019 website.\" Those sentences were inserted in front of an existing declaration about department personnel not using resources to help enforce federal immigration laws."

    "claim": "Says 50 percent of millennials don\u2019t associate with \"any political party.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim that \"50% of millennials don't associate with any political party\" because the evidence presented in the article suggests that while 50% of millennials identify as political independents, a substantial proportion of these independents vote consistently Democratic or Republican. The article cites a survey conducted by Pew Research Center that found 44% of independent millennials lean Democratic and 31% lean Republican, indicating that they behave like Democrats and vote like Democrats despite not using the party label. Additionally, other surveys have shown that millennials tend to vote Democratic in elections. Therefore, while it is true that half of millennials do not associate with any political party, it is also true that a significant portion of these independents have partisan leanings and voting behavior that align with the Democratic Party.",
    "doc": "Millennials are not big fans of professing commitment, according to a recent poll. They\u2019re not ready to declare a lifelong love for a political party (or a spouse, for that matter). In Facebook lingo, they might say \"It\u2019s complicated\" or claim to be in an open relationship with political parties. \"They should call us the \u2018party pooper\u2019 generation,\" tweeted Rock the Vote, an organization focused on increasing young registered voters, on March 11, 2014. \"50% of #millennials don't associate w/ any political party.\" After hearing about the youth vote helping elect President Barack Obama, we wondered if that statistic could be correct: Do half of millennials not associate with a political party? Identification and voting aren\u2019t the same In the tweet, Rock the Vote linked to a study released by Pew Research Center in March. Pew conducted the telephone survey of 1,821 adults nationwide in February, including 617 millennials ages 18 to 33, and analyzed previous surveys. This survey asked a variety of questions, ranging from whether they know what a \"selfie\" is to their thoughts on the tea party. As for millennials, Pew concluded: \"They are relatively unattached to organized politics and religion, linked by social media, burdened by debt, distrustful of people, in no rush to marry \u2014 and optimistic about the future.\" The survey showed that 50 percent of millennials describe themselves as political independents, up from 38 percent in 2004. Meanwhile, 27 percent identify as Democrats and 17 percent as Republicans. But a follow-up question shows how they tilt: The 50 percent who self-identified as independents were then asked if they leaned more to either party. Among those 50 percent, 44 percent lean Democratic and 31 percent lean Republican. That leaves about 25 percent who either mentioned another party or say they are independents and don\u2019t lean. When Pew included \"leaners,\" they found that half of millennials identify as Democrats or say they lean toward the Democratic Party, which is 16 points greater than the percentage who identify or say they lean Republican. A Democratic leaner \"behaves like a Democrat, thinks like a Democrat, votes like a Democrat,\" John Petrocik, a University of Missouri political science professor, told PolitiFact Florida. Many voting experts told us that when stated in isolation, describing half of millennials as independents is misleading because it omits their partisan leanings and voting behavior. \"A substantial proportion of self-described independents vote consistently Democratic or Republican; they just don\u2019t like to use a party label,\" said Peter Levine, professor of citizenship and public affairs at Tufts. \"True independents -- those who really don\u2019t know which party they\u2019ll support -- are few, and they tend to have low turnout.\" In the past, millennials have overwhelmingly voted Democratic. In 2008, 66 percent of voters age 18-29 voted for Obama -- that fell to 60 percent in 2012. Other surveys The Pew survey isn\u2019t the only recent poll to look at millennial party identification. A 2012 survey done by American National Election Studies, a collaboration of Stanford University and the University of Michigan, divided respondents into strong and not very strong Democrats and Republicans; independents who lean Democratic or Republican; and flat out independent. Not surprisingly the number of true independents drops -- and it\u2019s far below 50 percent for respondents ages 18-33. Strong Democrat 16.47% Not very strong Democrat 19.77% Independent-Democrat 11.81% All Democrats and leaners 48.05% Independent 16.36% Independent-Republican 11.26% Not very strong Republican 13.37% Republican 10.96% All Republicans and leaners 35.59% Partisan leanings and voting behavior, \"demonstrate quite clearly that millennials are by far the most Democratic age group in the American electorate today,\" said Alan I. Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University. Independents in Florida So what about here in Florida, where about 25 percent of the electorate is independent? In the ages 18-29 category, 40 percent were registered Democrat, 27 percent Republican and 29 percent no party affiliation as of August 2012, according to University of South Florida professor Susan MacManus. \"They see themselves as neither (Democrat or Republican) but when push comes to shove, depending on the candidate, they tend to lean Democratic,\" MacManus told PolitiFact Florida."

    "claim": "Says Libya \"Ambassador (Christopher) Stevens sent 600 requests for help\" in Benghazi.",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim made by Donald Trump that Ambassador Christopher Stevens sent 600 requests for help in Benghazi. The evidence provided in the article undermines Trump's statement. Firstly, the Republicans' count of 569 requests accumulated over nine months is significantly lower than the 600 figure cited by Trump. Secondly, Stevens was not yet the ambassador to Libya when the attacks occurred, which means that even if every request had been made by him and went directly to Clinton, the highest number Trump could cite would be around 205, not 600. Thirdly, the count is supposed to be the number of security requests or concerns from Benghazi to the State Department, not from Stevens to Clinton as Trump said. The article notes that it's common for such correspondence to be sent under the name of the ambassador, even if he/she never saw it, to the secretary of state, even though in the vast majority of cases it's handled by lower-level people and the secretary never sees it. Finally, the Washington Post Fact Checker found duplication in the data used by the GOP staff to come up with their total, which may have inflated the total number of requests. Based on these points, it is clear that Trump's claim is exaggerated and misleading, thus justifying the label \"Conflicting\".",
    "doc": "The death of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens came up as a topic during the second presidential debate Sunday night. When moderator Anderson Cooper asked Donald Trump if tweeting about a sex tape between 3 and 5 a.m. reflected the discipline of a good leader, Trump denied using those words and suddenly veered onto the subject of the 2012 attack on the mission compound in Benghazi, Libya. Security was inadequate and Stevens died of smoke inhalation from a fire during an attack by insurgents. Trump, apparently thinking that the drama unfolded at 3 a.m. in Washington, started referring to a famous Hillary Clinton commercial from her 2008 run for president, which argued that she was the best person for responding to a national emergency, as represented by a hypothetical 3 a.m. phone call to the White House. Trump: \"She said, 'Who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?' Guess what? She didn't answer because ... Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.\" It\u2019s hard to overstate how much is wrong here. The attack on the compound actually began at 9:42 p.m. in Libya, which was 3:42 p.m. in Washington. By 3 a.m. in Washington the following day, the attacks were over, and the people involved had either left Benghazi or were less than an hour from being flown out. So for this fact-check, we're going to focus on whether Stevens made 600 requests for help. Trump's cryptic comment might be heard as suggesting that Stevens made 600 \"requests for help\" during the attack. The investigations of Benghazi show that didn't happen. In fact, when we contacted the Trump campaign, they referred us to a graph that claimed something very different. First, there's no debate that security at the mission was inadequate and that requests for improvements stalled or rejected. Some security improvements were made the year of the attack, including \"heightening the perimeter wall, installing concrete Jersey barriers, mounting safety grills on the safe area windows, and other minor improvements,\" according to a 2014 Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report. But while the CIA was making significant upgrades to its nearby annex, similar improvements were not being done at the Benghazi mission. The CIA annex had nine security officers, but only three officers were assigned to the mission complex. A month before the attack, with the security situation deteriorating, Army Gen. Carter Ham, who was head of U.S. Africa Command, twice offered to give the U.S. embassy in Tripoli a special military security team. Stevens declined the offer. No reason was given, but it may have had to do with the State Department not wanting to aggravate the political instability in Libya with the presence of U.S. forces. When we contacted the Trump campaign, spokesman Dan Kowalski cited this chart, which was displayed during hearings by the Republican-led House Select Committee on Benghazi. But there's no reference to this chart in the report itself, released months later. Democrats on the committee, in their minority report, said that, \"During our hearing with Secretary Clinton, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan) argued that the Select Committee had obtained \u2018over 600 requests\u2019 for security from Benghazi, but he refused to provide the evidence for his claim.\" The minority report continues, \"Democrats have been unable to successfully reconstruct a list of 600 requests for additional security, and have been able to identify fewer than 200 requests, many of which were granted.\" A few things are worth noting right off the bat. \u2022 The Republicans\u2019 count is 569, not 600, accumulated over nine months. \u2022 Stevens wasn't sworn in as ambassador to Libya until May 2012. So even if every one of those requests/concerns originated from Stevens and went directly to Clinton, the highest number Trump could cite would be 205, not 600. \u2022 The count is supposed to be the number of security requests or concerns from Benghazi to the State Department, not from Stevens to Clinton, as Trump said. This can get ambiguous because such correspondence is often sent under the name of the ambassador, even if he/she never saw it, to the secretary of state, even though in the vast majority of cases it's handled by lower-level people and the secretary never sees it. As Clinton noted during her Jan. 23, 2013, testimony on the Benghazi attack, \"1.43 million cables a year come to the State Department. They are all addressed to me. They do not all come to me. They are reported through the bureaucracy.\" It's also not clear if all these requests were actually for Benghazi or were security-related requests involving the U.S. embassy in Tripoli as well. Earlier this year, the Washington Post Fact Checker looked into the 600 number, which was being cited by Trump and others. He found duplication. Once a request is made it can be followed by one or more statements of \"concern\" on the same topic, so there's a lot of overlap in the count. The Postwas given only a cursory look at the data used by the GOP staff to come up with their total, but he noted that one subject heading was repeated 17 times, suggesting that the same request was being repeatedly discussed. That alone may have inflated the total. To properly check whether the same security-related requests were being reported under different subject headings, the committee would have to release the documents. At the time, Kessler was reporting that the committee's final report \"is supposed to list the documents that formed the basis of the 600 figure.\" We contacted the committee twice and received no response. If we get additional information, we'll update this fact-check. In any event, Kessler noted, \"few if any\" requests were likely from Stevens. He called Trump's comment \"a whopper.\""
