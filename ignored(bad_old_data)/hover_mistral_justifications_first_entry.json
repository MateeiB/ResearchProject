    "justification": "1. Justification: The evidence mentions that Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer, Theodor Esbern Philipsen, and Kristian Zahrtmann were part of the Danish artistic generation in the late 19th century who favored naturalism and realism, breaking away from traditional Academicism. However, it does not explicitly state or imply that Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer studied with Ossian Elgstr\u00f6m or that they shared the same preference for naturalism along with Elgstr\u00f6m. It only mentions that Elgstr\u00f6m studied with Kristian Zahrtmann and Christian Krohg, not Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer. Therefore, while it is factual that these artists were part of the naturalist movement, there is no evidence to support that they shared a similar study experience or artistic preference with Ossian Elgstr\u00f6m.\n\n2. Label: NOT_SUPPORTED"
