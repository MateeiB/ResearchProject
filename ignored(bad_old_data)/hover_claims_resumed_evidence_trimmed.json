Released on 8\nJanuary 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday, the album was recorded in secret in New York City with his longtime co-producer\nTony Visconti\nand a group of local\njazz\nmusicians:\nDonny McCaslin\n,\nJason Lindner\n,\nTim Lefebvre\nand\nMark Guiliana\n.\nBen Monder\nand\nJames Murphy\ncontributed additional guitar and percussion, respectively. The album contains re-recorded versions of two songs, \"\nSue (Or in a Season of Crime)\n\" and \"\n'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore\n\", both of which were originally released in 2014.\nMore experimental than its predecessor\nThe Next Day\n(2013), the music on\nBlackstar\ncombines atmospheric\nart rock\nwith various styles of jazz. Bowie took inspiration from artists including\nKendrick Lamar\nand\nDeath Grips\n, listening to them during the album's production. The cover art, designed by\nJonathan Barnbrook\n, features a large black star with five star segments at the bottom that spell out the word \"BOWIE\".\nThe album was preceded by the singles \"\nBlackstar\n\" and \"\nLazarus\n\", both of which were supported by\nmusic videos\n. Two days after the album's release,\nBowie died\nof\ncancer\n; his illness had not been revealed to the public until then. Visconti described the album as Bowie's intended\nswan song\nand a \"parting gift\" for his fans before his death. Upon release, the album was met with commercial success, topping charts in a number of countries including the UK in the wake of Bowie's death, and became his only album to top the US\nBillboard\n200\n. It was the fifth-best-selling album of the year, worldwide, and has been certified Gold and Platinum in the US and the UK, respectively.\nCritically acclaimed,\nBlackstar\nwon three\nGrammy Awards\nat the\n59th Annual Grammy Awards\nin 2017 and awarded the\nBritish Album of the Year\nat the\n2017 Brit Awards\n. It was listed as one of the best albums of 2016 and later the 2010s decade by numerous publications.\nOuttakes\nfrom the recording sessions were released on the\nNo Plan\nEP in 2017. In the years following Bowie's death, commentators have named\nBlackstar\none of his best works, and was included in the 2018 edition of the book\n1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\n.\nBackground and recording\n[\nedit\n]\nDavid Bowie\nrecorded\nBlackstar\nwhile suffering from\ncancer\n.\n[\n2\n]\nLike his previous album\nThe Next Day\n(2013), recording took place in secret at the\nMagic Shop\nand Human Worldwide Studios in New York City, with production being co-handled by Bowie and longtime collaborator\nTony Visconti\n.\n[\n3\n]\nBowie began writing and making demos for songs that appear on\nBlackstar\nas soon as sessions for\nThe Next Day\nconcluded. Two songs, \"\nSue (Or in a Season of Crime)\n\" and \"\n'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore\n\", had been previously released, but were re-recorded for\nBlackstar\n.\n[\n4\n]\nThe title of the latter derives from\n'Tis Pity She's a Whore\n, a play by the 17th century English dramatist\nJohn Ford\n.\n[\n5\n]\nThe song \"\nLazarus\n\" was included in Bowie's\nOff-Broadway\nmusical\nof the same name\n.\n[\n6\n]\nThe backing band on\nBlackstar\n.\nTop:\nDonny McCaslin\n,\nJason Lindner\nBottom:\nTim Lefebvre\n,\nMark Guiliana\nBowie recruited a local New York jazz quartet led by saxophonist\nDonny McCaslin\n, and featuring other musicians including drummer\nMark Guiliana\n, pianist\nJason Lindner\nand bassist\nTim Lefebvre\n,\n[\n7\n]\n[\n8\n]\nas the backing band for the sessions.\n[\n9\n]\nMcCaslin and Guiliana previously played on the original version of \"Sue\".\n[\n10\n]\nThe musicians received demos from Bowie in December 2014 in preparation for the sessions at the start of the new year. Visconti told\nMojo\n: \"If we'd used [Bowie's] former musicians they would be rock people playing jazz...Having jazz guys play rock music turns it upside down.\"\n[\n9\n]\nLefebvre later said that the band's chemistry made the sessions much easier. Bowie knew exactly what he wanted, so Lefebvre felt special that Bowie chose a band that was a \"unit\" and not a random set of studio musicians. Bowie also encouraged the band to try new things and experiment with ideas; Lindner told\nRolling Stone\n, \"He gave us the freedom to really just play, sort of be ourselves, and if we were hearing anything in particular, to try it out.\"\n[\n11\n]\nVisconti gave consistent praise to the band, saying \"They can play something at the drop of a dime\".\n[\n12\n]\nRecording began at the Magic Shop in the first week of 2015. Most of the rhythm tracks were recorded in one or two takes. Tracks for both\nBlackstar\nand the\nLazarus\nmusical were recorded: \"Lazarus\", \"No Plan\", the re-working of \"'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore\" and \"When I Met You\".\n[\n12\n]\nDuring the week, Bowie celebrated his 68th birthday; his wife\nIman\nvisited him in the studio and the band played an avant-garde rendition of \"\nHappy Birthday\n\". Following the January sessions, further recording commenced in blocks; according to\nNicholas Pegg\n, they lasted four to six days each, in the first week of February and the third week of March. Bowie emailed demos to the musicians before each session.\n[\n13\n]\nThe backing band were reportedly unaware of Bowie's declining health \u2013 McCaslin said the band worked with Bowie \"essentially from 11 to 4 every day\", while Lefebvre stated that \"it never looked to us like he was sick\".\n[\n14\n]\nBen Monder\njoined the band for the March sessions as an additional guitarist.\nJames Murphy\nof\nLCD Soundsystem\nwas present during the second block of recording; his work on\nArcade Fire\n's\nReflektor\ninspired Bowie to create a remix of \"\nLove Is Lost\n\" for\nThe Next Day Extra\n.\n[\na\n]\nRecorded in early February was \"\nDollar Days\n\", \"\nGirl Loves Me\n\", \"Someday\" and the remake of \"Sue (Or In a Season of Crime)\".\n[\n17\n]\n\"Dollar Days\" was created without a preliminary demo being made for the song. McCaslin later stated that Bowie one day \"just picked up a guitar\n... he had this little idea, and we just learned it right there in the studio.\"\n[\n5\n]\nFor the March sessions, the band were joined by jazz guitarist\nBen Monder\n, who played on the original recording of \"Sue\". Songs recorded included \"\nBlackstar\n\", \"\nI Can't Give Everything Away\n\", \"Killing a Little Time\" and a remake of \"Someday\" (now retitled \"Blaze\"). Although Bowie performed his vocals live while the band were playing during the Magic Shop sessions, he and Visconti moved to Human Worldwide studios in April for proper recording. The majority of his vocals were recorded from scratch between April and May, although some vocals from the Magic Shop sessions, including part of \"I Can't Give Everything Away\" and the full vocal for \"No Plan\" were kept. The final master mix is credited to English engineer\nTom Elmhirst\n, although Bowie and Visconti oversaw the mixing sessions in general.\n[\n18\n]\nComposition and influences\n[\nedit\n]\nAccording to Visconti, he and Bowie deliberately attempted \"to avoid rock'n'roll\" while making the album. They listened to rapper\nKendrick Lamar\n's 2015 album\nTo Pimp a Butterfly\nduring the recording sessions and cited it as an influence.\n[\n19\n]\nDiscussing the album, Visconti said \"We wound up with nothing like that, but we loved the fact that Kendrick was so open-minded and he didn't do a straight-up hip-hop record. He threw everything on there, and that's exactly what we wanted to do.\"\n[\n20\n]\nAccording to Pegg, another album Bowie listened to during the sessions was\nD'Angelo\n's\nBlack Messiah\n(2014), which featured a fusion of soul, jazz and funk that was reminiscent of Bowie's work on \"Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)\".\n[\n20\n]\nElectronic duo\nBoards of Canada\nand experimental hip hop trio\nDeath Grips\nhave also been cited as influences.\n[\n19\n]\n[\n21\n]\nMusic\n[\nedit\n]\nJames Murphy\nof\nLCD Soundsystem\nplayed percussion on \"Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)\" and \"Girl Loves Me\".\n[\n20\n]\nThe music on\nBlackstar\nhas been characterised as incorporating\nart rock\n,\n[\n22\n]\n[\n23\n]\njazz\n,\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\nexperimental jazz\n,\n[\n25\n]\n[\n26\n]\nfree jazz\n,\n[\n22\n]\nand\nexperimental rock\n,\n[\n27\n]\nas well as elements of\nindustrial rock\n,\nfolk-pop\nand\nhip hop\n.\n[\n28\n]\nBryan Wawzenek of\nUltimate Classic Rock\nwrites that it was his most experimental album in years.\n[\n29\n]\nThe saxophone was the first instrument Bowie learned; he was an avid jazz listener in his youth\n[\n30\n]\n[\n31\n]\n[\n32\n]\nand had occasionally worked with jazz musicians in the past.\n[\nb\n]\nThe album's title track incorporates\nnu jazz\n[\n35\n]\nwhile progressing through a\ndrum and bass\n\u2013style rhythm, an\nacid house\n\u2013inspired portion of the instrumental, a saxophone solo, and a lower-tempo\nblues\n-like section.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\nTen minutes in length, it originally began as two separate melodies before being merged to one single piece.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n38\n]\nAndy Greene of\nRolling Stone\nsaid that the re-recording of \"'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore\" was \"powered by a hip hop beat and free-form sax\",\n[\n5\n]\nunlike the original, which was described by Dalton as \"a propulsive, roaring, heavily electronic wall of sound.\"\n[\n25\n]\n\"Lazarus\" is described by Pegg as \"an intense, brooding threnody\".\n[\n39\n]\nSome critics felt the track begins to drag across its six-minute runtime.\n[\n27\n]\n[\n25\n]\nAlthough the original version of \"Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)\" featured brass-heavy instrumentation and a\nbebop\n-jazz arrangement, Stephen Dalton of\nClassic Rock\nmagazine writes that the re-recorded version \"feels sharper, denser and heavier\", with added\nfunk rock\nguitar lines and \"percussive shudders\".\n[\n25\n]\n\"Girl Loves Me\" features synthesisers, \"acrobatic\" drumming, strings and \"bouncing\" bass.\n[\n27\n]\n[\n40\n]\n\"Dollar Days\", the sixth track, contains a sax solo and an arrangement that Dalton considers reminiscent of Bowie's work on\nYoung Americans\n(1975).\n[\n25\n]\nBiographer Chris O'Leary believes \"Dollar Days\" has \"the lushest arrangement\" on the album.\n[\n41\n]\nIn the final track, \"I Can't Give Everything Away\", Bowie plays a harmonica solo similar to one from his instrumental track \"\nA New Career in a New Town\n\" off his 1977 album\nLow\n.\n[\n42\n]\nLyrics\n[\nedit\n]\nBillboard\nand\nCNN\nwrote that Bowie's lyrics seem to address his impending death,\n[\n43\n]\n[\n44\n]\nwith CNN noting that the album \"reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality\".\n[\n43\n]\nThe title track features the lyrics: \"Something happened on the day he died / Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside / somebody else took his place, and bravely cried, 'I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar'\"; Jesse Kinos-Goodin of CBC Music felt these lyrics represented Bowie reflecting on his life and impending death.\n[\n22\n]\n\"Lazarus\" features the lines \"Look up here, I'm in heaven / I've got scars that can't be seen\", which appeared in many publications following Bowie's death on 10 January.\n[\n45\n]\n\"Girl Loves Me\" was notable for its inclusion of\nNadsat\n, a fictional language created by\nAnthony Burgess\nfor his 1962 novel\nA Clockwork Orange\n, where it was used very often.\n[\n46\n]\nIt also included\nPolari\n, a type of slang used commonly in England by homosexual men during the mid-20th century.\n[\n5\n]\nThe refrain, the explicit \"Where the fuck did Monday go?\", was interpreted by Pegg as the kind of desperation from a man who knows his time is running out.\n[\n40\n]\n\"Dollar Days\" contains the lyrics \"don't believe for just one second I'm forgetting you \u2014 I'm trying to, I'm dying to/too\", which Pegg and O'Leary note is a very dark pun.\n[\n41\n]\n[\n47\n]\n\"I Can't Give Everything Away\" contains the line \"Seeing more and feeling less / Saying no but meaning yes / This is all I ever meant / That's the message that I sent\", which led\nNeil McCormick\nof\nThe Daily Telegraph\nto think of the song as a point where \"Bowie sounds like he is grappling with his own mystery.\"\n[\n48\n]\nArtwork and packaging\n[\nedit\n]\nJonathan Barnbrook\ndesigned the album's artwork.\nThe artwork for\nBlackstar\nwas designed by\nJonathan Barnbrook\n, who filled the same role on\nHeathen\n(2002),\nReality\n(2003) and\nThe Next Day\n. The cover's star image is credited to\nNASA\nin the CD booklet.\n[\n3\n]\nThe five star segments below the main star form the word \"BOWIE\" in stylised letters.\n[\n49\n]\nThe vinyl cover, in black, features the star as a cutout, revealing the record (with an all-black picture label) beneath. With the record removed, the black paper behind the cutout reveals a hidden picture of a starfield when the foldout sleeve is held up to a light source. It took more than four months for fans to discover the effect. The designer claimed there were many other surprises hidden in the LP's artwork.\n[\n50\n]\n[\n51\n]\nMusic journalists noted that a \"black star lesion\", usually found inside a breast, suggests to medical practitioners evidence of certain types of cancer.\n[\n52\n]\n[\n53\n]\nThe sleeve is the first and only Bowie sleeve to not feature an image of the artist himself.\n[\n54\n]\nAfter Bowie's death, Barnbrook released the\nBlackstar\ndesign elements under a\nCreative Commons\nNonCommercial-ShareAlike license.\n[\n55\n]\nRelease\n[\nedit\n]\nThe title track was released as the album's\nlead single\non 19\nNovember 2015\n[\n56\n]\nand used as the opening music for the television series\nThe Last Panthers\n.\n[\n57\n]\nIts music video, shot in September 2015 in a\nBrooklyn\nstudio,\n[\n58\n]\nis a surreal ten-minute short film directed by\nThe Last Panthers\ndirector\nJohan Renck\n. It depicts a woman with a tail, played by\nElisa Lasowski\n,\n[\n59\n]\ndiscovering a dead astronaut and taking his jewel-encrusted skull to an ancient, otherworldly town. The astronaut's bones float toward a solar eclipse, while a circle of women perform a ritual with the skull in the town's centre.\n[\n60\n]\nThe short film won the award for\nBest Art Direction\nat the\n2016 MTV Video Music Awards\n.\n[\n61\n]\nThe second single, \"Lazarus\", was released on 17\nDecember 2015 as a digital download, and received its world premiere on\nBBC Radio 6 Music\n's\nSteve Lamacq Show\nthe same day.\n[\n62\n]\nA music video for \"Lazarus\", shot in November 2015 in a studio in Brooklyn and again directed by Renck,\n[\n63\n]\nwas released on 7\nJanuary 2016, the day before the album's release. It prominently features Bowie, appearing with a bandage and buttons sewn over his eyes, lying on a deathbed.\n[\n22\n]\nThe video was nominated for three awards: Best Direction,\nBest Cinematography\nand\nBest Editing\n, at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards.\n[\n64\n]\nBlackstar\nwas released on 8\nJanuary 2016, coinciding with Bowie's 69th birthday, through his ISO label,\nColumbia Records\nand\nSony Music\n.\n[\n65\n]\n[\n66\n]\n[\n67\n]\nTwo days later on 10\nJanuary,\nBowie died\nof cancer; his illness had not been revealed to the public until then. Visconti described the album as Bowie's intended\nswan song\nand a \"parting gift\" for his fans before his death.\n[\n2\n]\nWithin days of the album's release, online retailer\nAmazon.com\ntemporarily sold out of both the CD and LP editions.\n[\n68\n]\nThe third and final single, \"I Can't Give Everything Away\", was released posthumously on 6\nApril.\n[\n69\n]\nThe outtakes \"No Plan\", \"Killing a Little Time\" and \"When I Met You\" were included on an EP,\nNo Plan\n, released on 8\nJanuary 2017, which would have been Bowie's 70th birthday.\n[\n70\n]\nThe three songs had appeared on the\nsoundtrack album\nfor the\nLazarus\nmusical in October 2016.\n[\n70\n]\n[\n71\n]\nIn 2018,\nJon Culshaw\nplayed Bowie in the BBC radio play\nThe Final Take: Bowie in the Studio\n, an imagined account of Bowie as he works on the album and looks back over his life.\n[\n72\n]\nCritical reception\n[\nedit\n]\nProfessional ratings\nAggregate scores\nSource\nRating\nAnyDecentMusic?\n8.4/10\n[\n73\n]\nMetacritic\n87/100\n[\n74\n]\nReview scores\nSource\nRating\nAllMusic\n[\n75\n]\nThe A.V.

On\nMetacritic\n, the album has an average score of 87 out of 100 based on 43 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n[\n74\n]\nSeveral considered it a career highlight.\n[\n84\n]\nRolling Stone\ncritic\nDavid Fricke\ncalled\nBlackstar\n\"a ricochet of textural eccentricity and pictorial-shrapnel writing\".\n[\n82\n]\nAndy Gill of\nThe Independent\nregarded the record as \"the most extreme album of [Bowie's] entire career\", stating that \"\nBlackstar\nis as far as he's strayed from pop.\"\n[\n79\n]\nJon Pareles\nof\nThe New York Times\ndescribed the album as \"at once emotive and cryptic, structured and spontaneous and, above all, willful, refusing to cater to the expectations of radio stations or fans\".\n[\n85\n]\nThe Daily Telegraph\n'\ns Neil McCormick hailed\nBlackstar\nas an \"extraordinary\" album which \"suggests that, like a modern day\nLazarus\nof pop, Bowie is well and truly back from beyond.\"\n[\n48\n]\nAlexis Petridis\nof\nThe Guardian\npraised the album, calling it \"a rich, deep and strange album that feels like Bowie moving restlessly forward, his eyes fixed ahead: the position in which he's always made his greatest music.\"\n[\n78\n]\nIn a favourable review for\nExclaim!\n, Michael Rancic wrote that\nBlackstar\nis \"a defining statement from someone who isn't interested in living in the past, but rather, for the first time in a while, waiting for everyone else to catch up\".\n[\n86\n]\nReviewing for\nQ\nmagazine, Tom Doyle wrote, \"\nBlackstar\nis a more concise statement than\nThe Next Day\nand a far, far more intriguing one.\"\n[\n23\n]\nNME\ncritic Sam Richards stated that Bowie had maintained his \"formidable record of reinventing himself\" on a \"busy, bewildering and occasionally beautiful record\", adding that \"one of the few certainties we can take from this restless, relentlessly intriguing album is that David Bowie is positively allergic to the idea of heritage rock.\"\n[\n80\n]\nChris Gerard of\nPopMatters\ncalled the album \"singular in its unique sound and vibe,\" describing it as \"trippy and majestic head-music spun from moonage daydreams and made for gliding in and out of life.\"\n[\n87\n]\nLeah Greenblatt of\nEntertainment Weekly\nconsidered the album Bowie's best work in years. In a review published before his death, Greenblatt felt the album contained enough themes and imagery that could \"probably be dissected for days or even weeks.\"\n[\n77\n]\nIn a review before Bowie's death, Ryan Dombal of\nPitchfork\nwrote: \"This tortured immortality is no gimmick: Bowie will live on long after the man has died. For now, though, he's making the most of his latest reawakening, adding to the myth while the myth is his to hold.\"\n[\n81\n]\nBarry Walters of\nNPR\n, reviewing the album the day after Bowie's death, believed the album \"resonates precisely because it favors emotion over meaning.\" Walters felt that the album is \"so startling\" because it reminded listeners that even though Bowie was long past his golden years, it is almost as if he never left them. He concluded the review stating \"even while staring down death, [he] reversed his claim on \"\nStation to Station\n\" so many years ago: It's never too late to be grateful.\"\n[\n88\n]\nWriting for\nThe A.V. Club\n, which chose it as the best album of 2016, Sean O'Neal described\nBlackstar\nas \"a sonically adventurous album that proves Bowie was always one step ahead\u2014where he'll now remain in perpetuity.\"\n[\n89\n]\nSandra Sperounes of the\nEdmonton Journal\nstated that Bowie kept true to the artistic statement \"An artist must be willing to embrace failure as one step to evolving what it is he does. You have to be able to fail to accept it \u2013 otherwise you're not going to go anywhere. With\nBlackstar\n, he kept true to this artistic statement until his body failed. We have to accept it \u2013 the Starman is now returning to the heavens above.

The Rangers compete in the\nNational Hockey League\n(NHL) as a member of the\nMetropolitan Division\nin the\nEastern Conference\n. The team plays its home games at\nMadison Square Garden\n, an arena they share with the\nNew York Knicks\nof the\nNational Basketball Association\n(NBA). They are one of three NHL franchises located in the\nNew York metropolitan area\n; the others being the\nNew Jersey Devils\nand\nNew York Islanders\n.\nFounded in 1926 by\nTex Rickard\n, the Rangers are one of the\nOriginal Six\nteams that competed in the NHL before its\n1967 expansion\n, along with the\nBoston Bruins\n,\nChicago Blackhawks\n,\nDetroit Red Wings\n,\nMontreal Canadiens\nand\nToronto Maple Leafs\n. The team attained success early on under the guidance of\nLester Patrick\n, who coached a team containing\nFrank Boucher\n,\nMurray Murdoch\n, and\nBun\nand\nBill Cook\nto win the\nStanley Cup\nin only their second season.\n[\n3\n]\nThey were the first NHL franchise in the United States to win the trophy, and are still the fastest true expansion team in NHL history to do so. The team won two more Stanley Cups in 1933 and 1940.\nFollowing this initial grace period, the franchise struggled between the 1940s and 1960s, wherein playoff appearances and successes were infrequent. The team enjoyed a mini-renaissance in the 1970s, where they made the\nStanley Cup Finals\ntwice, losing to the Bruins in 1972 and the Canadiens in 1979. The Rangers subsequently embraced a rebuild for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, which eventually paid dividends in 1994, where the team, led by\nMark Messier\n,\nBrian Leetch\n,\nAdam Graves\n, and\nMike Richter\n, captured their fourth Stanley Cup.\nThe team was unable to duplicate that success in the years that followed, and entered into another period of mediocrity. They endured a franchise-record seven-year postseason drought from 1998 to 2005 and languished for the majority of the 2000s before enjoying another period of prosperity after the\n2004\u201305 NHL Lockout\n. After the arrival of goaltender\nHenrik Lundqvist\n, the Rangers thrived, missing the playoffs just once between 2006 and 2017. They reached the Stanley Cup Finals in 2014, falling to the\nLos Angeles Kings\nin five games.\nSeveral former members of the Rangers have been inducted into the\nHockey Hall of Fame\n, four of whom \u2013\nBuddy O'Connor\n,\nChuck Rayner\n,\nAndy Bathgate\n, and Messier \u2013 have won the\nHart Memorial Trophy\nwhile playing for the team.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHistory of the New York Rangers\nTex Rickard\n, president of\nMadison Square Garden\n, was awarded the Rangers in 1926.\nEarly years (1926\u20131967)\n[\nedit\n]\nGeorge Lewis \"Tex\" Rickard\n, president of\nMadison Square Garden\n, was awarded an NHL franchise for the\n1926\u201327 season\nto compete with the\nNew York Americans\n, who had begun play at the Garden the previous season. The Americans' early success in their inaugural season exceeded expectations, leading Rickard to pursue a second team for the Garden despite promising the Americans that they were going to be the only ice hockey team to play there.\n[\n4\n]\nThe team was originally incorporated under the name \"New York Giants Professional Hockey Club\" during a league meeting with NHL president\nFrank Calder\non April 17, 1926, but during the meeting the name was then changed to \"New York Rangers Hockey Club.\" The new team was quickly nicknamed \"Tex's Rangers\".\n[\n5\n]\nRickard's franchise began play in the 1926\u201327 season. The first team crest was a horse sketched in blue carrying a cowboy waving a hockey stick aloft, before being changed to the familiar \"RANGERS\" in diagonal.\n[\n6\n]\nFuture\nToronto Maple Leafs\nowner\nConn Smythe\nwas hired to assemble the team, however he had a falling-out with Rickard's hockey man,\nCol. John S. Hammond\n, and was fired as manager-coach on the eve of the first season \u2013 he was paid a then-hefty $2,500 to leave. Smythe was replaced by\nPacific Coast Hockey Association\nco-founder\nLester Patrick\n.\n[\n7\n]\nThe new team Smythe assembled turned out to be a winner. The Rangers won the\nAmerican Division\ntitle their first year but lost to the\nBoston Bruins\nin the playoffs.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n9\n]\nThe team's early success led to players becoming minor celebrities and fixtures in New York City's\nRoaring Twenties\nnightlife. It was during this time, playing at the Garden on 49th Street, blocks away from\nTimes Square\n, that the Rangers obtained their nickname \"The Broadway Blueshirts\". On December 13, 1929, the Rangers became the first team in the NHL to travel by plane when they hired the\nCurtiss-Wright Corporation\nto fly them to\nToronto\nfor a game against the Maple Leafs, which they lost 7\u20136.\n[\n10\n]\nIn only the\nsecond season\n, they won the\n1928 Stanley Cup\n, defeating the\nMontreal Maroons\nthree games to two.\n[\n11\n]\nOne of the most memorable stories that emerged from the finals involved Patrick playing in goal at the age of 44. At the time, teams were not required to dress a backup\ngoaltender\n. When the Rangers' starting goaltender,\nLorne Chabot\n, left a game with an\neye injury\n, Maroons\nhead coach\nEddie Gerard\nvetoed Patrick's original choice for an emergency replacement,\nAlex Connell\nof the\nOttawa Senators\n, who was in attendance. An angry Patrick lined up between the pipes for two periods in game 2 of the finals, allowing one goal to Maroons center\nNels Stewart\n.\nFrank Boucher\nscored the game-winning goal in overtime for New York.\n[\n12\n]\nAfter a loss to the Bruins in the\n1929 Stanley Cup Finals\n[\n3\n]\nand an early struggle in the early 1930s, the Rangers, led by brothers\nBill\nand\nBun Cook\non the right and left wings, respectively, and Frank Boucher at center, defeated the Maple Leafs in the\n1933 Stanley Cup Finals\nto win their second Stanley Cup. The Rangers spent the rest of the 1930s playing close to 0.500 hockey until their next Cup win. Lester Patrick stepped down as head coach and was replaced by Frank Boucher.\n[\n13\n]\nThe Bread Line was the Rangers' first notable\nline\n. Consisting of\nBill Cook\n,\nBun Cook\nand\nFrank Boucher\n, they played together from 1926 to 1937.\nIn the\n1939\u201340 season\n, the Rangers finished the regular season in second place behind Boston. The two teams then met in the first round of the playoffs. The Bruins gained a two-games-to-one series lead from New York, but the Rangers recovered to win three-straight games, defeating the first-place Bruins four games to two. The Rangers' first-round victory gave them a bye until the finals. The\nDetroit Red Wings\ndefeated the New York Americans in their first-round best-of-three series two games to one, and the Toronto Maple Leafs ousted the\nChicago Black Hawks\ntwo games to none. The Maple Leafs then swept Detroit a best-of-three series to advance to the finals. The\n1940 Stanley Cup Finals\ncommenced in Madison Square Garden. In game 1, the Rangers needed overtime to gain a 1\u20130 series lead, but they won game two more easily with a 6\u20132 victory. The series then shifted to Toronto, where the Maple Leafs won the next two games, tying the series at two games apiece. In games 5 and 6, the Rangers won in overtime, taking the series four games to two to earn their third Stanley Cup.\nHowever, the Rangers collapsed by the mid-1940s, losing games by scores as lopsided as 15\u20130. In\n1943\u201344\n, goaltender\nKen McAuley\nled the league with 39 losses and 310 goals allowed in 50 games played; his 6.24 goals-against average that year remains the worst in NHL history by a goaltender playing at least 25 games in a season.\n[\n14\n]\nThey missed the playoffs for five consecutive seasons before earning the fourth and final playoff spot in\n1947\u201348\n. They lost in the first round and missed the playoffs again in\n1948\u201349\n. In the\n1950 Stanley Cup Finals\n, the Rangers were forced to play all of their games, including \"home\" games, in Toronto, while the\ncircus\nwas held at the Garden. They lost to the Detroit Red Wings in overtime in the seventh game of the finals.\nDuring this time, Red Wings owner\nJames E. Norris\nbecame the largest stockholder in the Garden. However, he did not buy controlling interest in the arena, which would have violated the NHL's rule against one person owning more than one team. Nonetheless, he had enough support on the board to exercise de facto control. The Rangers remained a mark of futility in the NHL for most of the remainder of the\nOriginal Six\nera, missing the playoffs in 12 of the next 16 years. However, the team was rejuvenated in the late 1960s, symbolized by moving into the\nfourth version of Madison Square Garden\nin 1968. A year earlier, they made the playoffs for the first time in five years on the strength of rookie goaltender\nEddie Giacomin\nand 37-year-old former 1950s\nMontreal Canadiens\nstar right wing\nBernie \"Boom Boom\" Geoffrion\n, signed out of retirement in 1966.\nPost-Original Six era (1967\u20131993)\n[\nedit\n]\nJean Ratelle\nplayed with the Rangers from 1960 to 1975.\nThe Rangers made the finals twice in the 1970s, but lost both times to two 1970s powerhouses; in six games to the\nBoston Bruins\nin\n1972\n, who were led by such stars as\nBobby Orr\n,\nPhil Esposito\n,\nKen Hodge\n,\nJohnny Bucyk\nand\nWayne Cashman\n; and in five games to the Canadiens in\n1979\n, who had\nBob Gainey\n,\nGuy Lafleur\n,\nLarry Robinson\n,\nKen Dryden\n,\nGuy Lapointe\nand\nSerge Savard\n.\nThe Rangers reached the\n1972 Stanley Cup Finals\ndespite losing high-scoring center\nJean Ratelle\n(who had been on pace over Bruin\nPhil Esposito\nto become the first Ranger since\nBryan Hextall\nin 1942 to lead the NHL in scoring) to injury during the stretch drive of the regular season. The strength of players such as\nBrad Park\n, Jean Ratelle,\nVic Hadfield\nand\nRod Gilbert\n(the last three constructing the famed \"\nGAG line\n\", standing for \"goal-a-game\") carried them through the playoffs. They defeated the defending-champion Canadiens in the first round and the Chicago Black Hawks in the second, but lost to the Bruins in the finals.\nIn the 1972 playoffs, with Ratelle sidelined with a broken ankle and Gilbert hampered by injuries,\nWalt Tkaczuk\nplayed a key role as the Rangers defeated the defending champion Canadiens and the previous year's finalists, the Black Hawks, to reach the Stanley Cup Finals. While the Rangers lost to the Boston Bruins in six games, Tkaczuk earned much respect for holding the Bruins' Phil Esposito without a goal in the series.\nThe Rangers played a legendary conference semifinals series against the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nin the\n1974 playoffs\n, losing in seven games and becoming the first Original Six club to lose a playoff series to a 1967 expansion team. This series was noted for a game 7 fight between\nDale Rolfe\nof the Rangers and\nDave Schultz\nof the Flyers.\n[\n15\n]\nThe Rangers' new rivals, the\nNew York Islanders\n, who entered the League in\n1972\u201373\nafter paying a hefty territorial fee \u2013 some $4 million \u2013 to the Rangers, were their first-round opponents in the\n1975 playoffs\n. After splitting the first two games, the Islanders defeated the more-established Rangers 11 seconds into overtime of the deciding game 3, establishing a rivalry that continued to grow for years.\nIn a blockbuster trade with the\nBoston Bruins\n, the Rangers acquired Esposito and\nCarol Vadnais\nfrom the Bruins for Park, Ratelle and\nJoe Zanussi\nin\n1975\n, while Swedish stars\nAnders Hedberg\nand\nUlf Nilsson\njumped to the Rangers from the League's rival, the\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) in\n1978\n. In the\n1979 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, New York defeated the surging Islanders in the conference semifinals and advanced to the\n1979 Stanley Cup Finals\n, losing to the Canadiens. In four consecutive playoffs (\n1981\n\u2013\n1984\n), the Rangers were eliminated by the rival Islanders, who went on to win the Stanley Cup in 1981, 1982 and 1983.\nMarcel Dionne\n, who signed with Rangers in the 1986 off-season, in 1987\nThe Rangers stayed competitive through the 1980s and early 1990s, making the playoffs each year. In the\n1986 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, the Rangers, behind the play of rookie goaltender\nJohn Vanbiesbrouck\n, upended the\nPatrick Division\n-winning Flyers in five games followed by a six-game win over the\nWashington Capitals\nin the Patrick Division finals. Montreal, however, disposed of the Rangers in the\nWales Conference\nfinals behind a rookie goaltender of their own,\nPatrick Roy\n. For the\n1986\u201387 season\n, the team acquired superstar center\nMarcel Dionne\nafter almost 12 years with the\nLos Angeles Kings\n.\n[\n16\n]\nIn 1988, while a Ranger, Dionne moved into third place in\nNHL career goals scored\n. Dionne spent nine games in the minors before retiring during the\n1988\u201389 season\n.\nFrustration was at its peak when the\n1991\u201392 Rangers\ncaptured the\nPresidents' Trophy\n. They took a 2\u20131 series lead on the defending champion\nPittsburgh Penguins\nand then faltered in three-straight (some observers note a\nRon Francis\nslapshot from outside the blue line that eluded goaltender\nMike Richter\nas the series' turning point).\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\nThe following year, injuries and a 1\u201311 regular season finish landed the Rangers at the bottom of the Patrick Division after being in a playoff position for much of the season. Head coach\nRoger Neilson\ndid not finish the season.\nDuring this period, the Rangers were owned by\nGulf+Western\n, which was renamed to Paramount Communications in 1989, and sold to\nViacom\nin 1994. Viacom then sold the team to\nITT Corporation\nand\nCablevision\n, and a couple of years later, ITT sold their ownership stake to Cablevision, who owned the team until 2010, when they spun off the MSG properties as their own company.\nEnding the curse (1993\u201394)\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\n1993\u201394 season\nwas the Rangers' most successful in 54 years, as Mike Keenan coached the Rangers to the\n1994 Stanley Cup championship\n, winning their fourth Cup.\n[\n19\n]\nBy the 1993\u201394 season, the Rangers had acquired seven players who had been part of the\nEdmonton Oilers\n' Cup-winning teams: Oilers captain (and new Rangers captain)\nMark Messier\n,\nAdam Graves\n,\nKevin Lowe\n,\nJeff Beukeboom\n,\nEsa Tikkanen\n,\nCraig MacTavish\nand\nGlenn Anderson\n. Graves set a team record with 52 goals, breaking the prior record of 50 held by\nVic Hadfield\n. The Rangers clinched the Presidents' Trophy by finishing with the best record in the NHL at 52\u201324\u20138, setting a franchise record with 112 points earned.\n[\n20\n]\nThe Rangers successfully made it past the first two rounds of the playoffs, sweeping the New York Islanders, and then defeating the Washington Capitals in five games. However, in the conference finals against the third-seeded\nNew Jersey Devils\n, the Rangers lost the series opener at home in double overtime, but won the next two games before the Devils defeated them 3\u20131 and 4\u20131. The series headed back to the\nMeadowlands\nfor the sixth game, in which Messier, who had guaranteed a win to the press,\nscored three times\nin the final period to lead the Rangers to a 4\u20132 win and set up a seventh game back at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers won game 7, 2\u20131, when\nStephane Matteau\nscored a goal in double overtime, leading the team to the finals for the first time since\n1979\n.\nThe Rangers acquired\nWayne Gretzky\nas a free agent in the 1996 off-season.\nUp against the\nVancouver Canucks\n, the Rangers again lost the series opener at home in overtime. The Rangers bounced back and they won the next three games, allowing the Canucks just four goals. However, the Canucks won the next two 6\u20133 and 4\u20131 to set up a seventh game, for the second consecutive series, at home.\n[\n21\n]\nIn the seventh game, the Rangers took a 2\u20130 first period lead, with Messier scoring later to put the Rangers up 3\u20131, the eventual Cup winning goal as the home team won 3\u20132, becoming the first (and to this date, only) player to captain two teams to the Stanley Cup.\n[\n22\n]\nBrian Leetch\nbecame the first American-born player to win the\nConn Smythe Trophy\nas playoff MVP,\n[\n23\n]\nwhile\nAlexander Karpovtsev\n,\nAlexei Kovalev\n,\nSergei Nemchinov\nand\nSergei Zubov\nbecame the first Russians to have their names engraved on the Cup.\n[\n24\n]\nExpensive acquisitions and postseason drought (1995\u20132005)\n[\nedit\n]\nDespite having coached the Rangers to a regular season first-place finish and the Stanley Cup victory, head coach Mike Keenan left after a dispute with general manager\nNeil Smith\n. During the\nlockout\n-shortened\n1994\u201395 season\n, the Rangers won their first-round series with the\nQuebec Nordiques\n, but lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Philadelphia Flyers in four games with succeeding head coach\nColin Campbell\n. General manager Neil Smith orchestrated a deal that sent Sergei Zubov and center\nPetr Nedved\nto Pittsburgh in exchange for defenseman\nUlf Samuelsson\nand left-winger\nLuc Robitaille\nin the summer of 1995. The Rangers defeated the Canadiens in six games in the\n1996 playoffs\n, but lost their second-round series to the Penguins in five games.\nThe Rangers then acquired\nWayne Gretzky\nin 1996. Gretzky's greatest accomplishment with the Rangers was leading them to the\n1997 conference finals\n, where they lost 4\u20131 to the Flyers, who were then led by\nEric Lindros\n. Mark Messier, a former Oiler teammate of Gretzky's, left in the summer of 1997 and the team failed in a bid to replace him with\nColorado Avalanche\nsuperstar\nJoe Sakic\n.\n[\n25\n]\nThe Rangers missed the playoffs for seven consecutive seasons, finishing no higher than fourth in their division. Gretzky retired at the end of the\n1998\u201399 season\n.\nIn March 2000, Smith was fired along with head coach\nJohn Muckler\n, and that summer,\nJames Dolan\nhired\nGlen Sather\nto replace him.\n[\n26\n]\nBy the end of the\n2000\u201301 season\n, the Rangers had landed a significant amount of star power. Messier had returned to New York,\nTheoren Fleury\njoined the Rangers after spending most of his career with the\nCalgary Flames\n[\n27\n]\nand Eric Lindros was traded to the Rangers by the Flyers.\n[\n28\n]\nThe Rangers also acquired\nPavel Bure\nlate in\n2001\u201302\nfrom the\nFlorida Panthers\n.\n[\n29\n]\nIt was also the rookie season of goalie\nDan Blackburn\n, who made the\nNHL All-Rookie Team\neven as the Rangers fell back to last place in the Conference,\n[\n30\n]\nand finished out of the playoffs. Later years saw other stars such as Alexei Kovalev,\nJaromir Jagr\n,\nMartin Rucinsky\nand\nBobby Holik\nadded, but in\n2002\u201303\nand\n2003\u201304\n, the team again missed the playoffs. Blackburn started strongly in 2002\u201303, but burned out after 17 games. He missed 2003\u201304 due to\nmononucleosis\nand a damaged nerve in his left\nshoulder\n. Blackburn could not rehabilitate the damaged nerve, and was forced to retire at the age of 22.\n[\n31\n]\nTowards the end of the\n2003\u201304 season\n, general manager Glen Sather finally gave in to a rebuilding process by trading away Brian Leetch, Alexei Kovalev, and eight others for numerous prospects and draft picks. With the retirements of Pavel Bure and Mark Messier, as well as Eric Lindros signing with the Toronto Maple Leafs, the post-lockout Rangers, under new head coach\nTom Renney\n, moved away from high-priced veterans towards a group of talented young players, such as\nPetr Prucha\n,\nDominic Moore\nand\nBlair Betts\n.\nHenrik Lundqvist era (2005\u20132020)\n[\nedit\n]\nReturn to the playoffs (2005\u20132011)\n[\nedit\n]\nStellar performances by rookie goaltender\nHenrik Lundqvist\nduring the\n2005\u201306 season\nled to the Rangers' best record since\n1993\u201394\n.\nThe Rangers were expected to struggle during the\n2005\u201306 season\n, but behind stellar performances by Swedish rookie goaltender\nHenrik Lundqvist\n, the Rangers finished the season with a record of 44\u201326\u201312, their best record since 1993\u201394. Jagr broke the Rangers' single-season points record with a first-period assist in a 5\u20131 win against the New York Islanders on March 29, 2006.\n[\n32\n]\nThe assist gave him 110 points on the season, breaking\nJean Ratelle\n's record.\n[\n33\n]\nLess than two weeks later, on April 8, Jagr scored his 53rd goal of the season against the Boston Bruins, breaking the club record previously held by Adam Graves.\n[\n34\n]\nTwo games prior, on April 4, the Rangers defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 3\u20132, in a shootout, to clinch a playoff spot for the first time since\n1996\u201397\n.\n[\n35\n]\nIn the\n2006 conference quarterfinals\n, the Rangers drew a matchup with the Devils and were defeated in a four-game sweep. Jagr fell two points short of winning his sixth\nArt Ross Trophy\nas scoring champion in 2005\u201306, but did win his third\nPearson Award\nas the players' choice for the most outstanding player.\nJaromir Jagr\nwas named team captain at the start of the\n2006\u201307 NHL season\n.\nRealizing that the team had trouble scoring goals in the 2005\u201306 campaign, the Rangers signed\nTriple Gold Club\nwinner and 12-time 30-goal scorer\nBrendan Shanahan\nto a one-year contract. On October 5, 2006, opening night of the\n2006\u201307 season\n, Jagr was named the first team captain since Mark Messier's retirement.\n[\n36\n]\nThough the Rangers started slow in the first half of the 2006\u201307 season, the second half was dominated by the stellar goaltending of Henrik Lundqvist. On February 5, 2007, the Rangers acquired agitating forward\nSean Avery\nin a trade with the Los Angeles Kings, which brought further intensity to the team. Despite losing several players to injury in March, the Rangers went 10\u20132\u20133 in the month and clinched a playoff berth for the second consecutive season. Facing the\nAtlanta Thrashers\nin the first round of the\n2007 playoffs\n, the Rangers swept the series. However, they were eliminated in the next round by the\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\nAt the\n2007 NHL entry draft\n, the Rangers chose\nAlexei Cherepanov\n17th overall, who had been ranked by the\nNHL Central Scouting Bureau\nas the number one European skater.\n[\n37\n]\nDespite the departure of Michael Nylander, the 2007 free agency season started with a bang for the Rangers, with the signing of two high-profile centerman;\nScott Gomez\non a seven-year contract, as well as\nChris Drury\non a five-year deal.\n[\n38\n]\nThe moves, along with retaining most other key players, had been met favorably, and the Rangers made the playoffs for the third consecutive season and the second round for the second season in a row. Despite these streaks, the Rangers failed to meet expectations, losing their second-round series to the Pittsburgh Penguins. The following off-season saw the departures of captain Jaromir Jagr to the KHL, and alternate captains Martin Straka and Brendan Shanahan, who left to play in the Czech Republic and with the New Jersey Devils, respectively.\nJohn Tortorella\nwas named the team's head coach in 2009, maintaining the position until 2013.\nFollowing Jagr's departure, Chris Drury was named captain on October 3, 2008. The Rangers were one of four NHL teams to open the\n2008\u201309 season\nin Europe, being featured in the\nVictoria Cup\nfinal, defeating the European Champions Cup winner\nMetallurg Magnitogorsk\nin\nBern\n, Switzerland. This was followed by two NHL regular season games against Tampa Bay in\nPrague\non October 4 and 5, and the Rangers won both games. The Rangers tied the 1983\u201384 Rangers for the best start in franchise history with a 5\u20130 record, and set the franchise record for best start in a season through the first 13 games by going 10\u20132\u20131 for 21 points, with the 10 wins and 21 points each becoming franchise records. A successful start to the season, however, was tempered with by the news of the sudden death of 2007 first-round pick Alexei Cherepanov, which occurred during a KHL game in Russia on October 13.\n[\n39\n]\nA disappointing second half of the season followed. After the Rangers went 2\u20137\u20133 in 12 games, coach Tom Renney was fired, with\n2004 Stanley Cup\nand\nJack Adams Award\nwinner\nJohn Tortorella\nnamed as his replacement.\n[\n40\n]\nThe Rangers made the\n2009 playoffs\n, but lost their opening-round series to the Washington Capitals four games to three.\nOn June 30, 2009, the Rangers traded Scott Gomez,\nTom Pyatt\n, and\nMichael Busto\nto the Montreal Canadiens for\nRyan McDonagh\n,\nChris Higgins\n,\nPavel Valentenko\n, and\nDoug Janik\n. With Gomez's salary cap hit gone, the Rangers signed superstar\nMarian Gaborik\non the first day of free agency. In the\n2009\u201310 season\n, the Rangers failed to make the playoffs for the first time in five years. There was some criticism that the off-season acquisition of Gaborik had not paid off, despite Gaborik scoring 42 goals and 86 points in the season. The final two games of the season were a home-and-home against the Philadelphia Flyers, with both teams competing for the same playoff spot. The Rangers skated away with the victory in the first game, keeping their postseason hopes alive. In the second game, the Flyers peppered Henrik Lundqvist with 47 shots, but scored only once. The game went to a shootout, and the Flyers prevailed to move on to the playoffs.\nOn September 12, 2011,\nRyan Callahan\nwas named the 26th captain in Rangers history.\nFor the\n2010\u201311 season\n, the team waived defenseman\nWade Redden\nand brought in several players to achieve more balanced scoring. On November 12, the Rangers unveiled the new Heritage Jersey for the first time at the\nice rink at Rockefeller Center\nin a special ceremony featuring Rangers alumni and current players discussing the history of the storied franchise. The club wore the jersey for the first time on November 17 when they played the Boston Bruins at Madison Square Garden. The Rangers' playoff chances came down to the final day of the regular season for the second-straight year. The team defeated the New Jersey Devils and passed the\nCarolina Hurricanes\nin the standings, putting the Rangers in the playoffs after missing out the previous season. The Rangers faced Washington in the first round and lost the series in five games. It was the second time in three years that the Capitals eliminated the Rangers from the playoffs, fueling a rivalry that lasted several seasons.\nOn May 13, 2011, Rangers forward\nDerek Boogaard\nwas found dead in his\nMinnesota\napartment.\n[\n41\n]\nOn June 29, the Rangers bought out captain Chris Drury's contract. On July 3, the Rangers signed free agent\nBrad Richards\nto a nine-year contract.\n[\n42\n]\nOn September 12,\nRyan Callahan\nwas named the 26th captain in the Rangers' history.\n[\n43\n]\nHe became the fifth-youngest captain in team history.\n[\n44\n]\nBrad Richards and\nMarc Staal\nwere named alternate captains on the same day.\nReturn to the Finals and third Presidents' Trophy (2011\u20132016)\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the\n2011\u201312 season\n, the team finished as the top seed in the Eastern Conference, recording 51 wins and 109 points. Their leading scorer was Marian Gaborik, who finished the season with 41 goals and 76 points while playing all 82 games. In the first round of the playoffs, the Rangers faced the eighth-seeded Ottawa Senators. After falling behind 3\u20132 in the series, the Rangers bounced back to win game 6 in\nOttawa\nas well as game 7 at home. In the next round, the Rangers once again faced the Capitals. In game 3, Gaborik scored to win 14:41 into the third overtime, giving the Rangers a 2\u20131 lead in the series, but Washington came back to tie the series 2\u20132 in game 4. Washington was up by one during the final minutes of game 5 when\nJoel Ward\ncommitted a high-sticking double-minor. Richards scored to tie with just 6.6 seconds remaining, and in overtime, defenseman Marc Staal scored on the second penalty of the double-minor just 1:35 into overtime. Rangers went on to win the series 4\u20133, sending them to the conference finals for the first time since 1997. In the conference finals, they faced the New Jersey Devils, a major divisional rival. After leading the series 2\u20131, the Rangers lost three games in a row, losing game 6 in New Jersey with a goal by Devils forward\nAdam Henrique\nat 1:03 in overtime, giving the Devils a 4\u20132 series win and ending the Rangers' season.\nOn July 23, 2012, the Rangers traded\nBrandon Dubinsky\n,\nArtem Anisimov\n,\nTim Erixon\nand a\n2013\nfirst-round draft pick to the\nColumbus Blue Jackets\nin exchange for\nRick Nash\n,\nSteven Delisle\n, and a 2013 conditional third-round pick.\n[\n45\n]\nAt the 2013\nNHL trade deadline\non April 3, the Rangers then traded Marian Gaborik and Steven Delisle to Columbus for\nDerick Brassard\n,\nDerek Dorsett\n,\nJohn Moore\n, and a 2014 sixth-round draft pick.\n[\n46\n]\nAfter the Rangers were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs by Boston, management fired head coach John Tortorella, and on June 21, 2013, general manager Glen Sather formally introduced former Canucks head coach\nAlain Vigneault\nas Tortorella's replacement.\n[\n47\n]\nThe Rangers acquired\nRick Nash\nin a multi-player trade with the\nColumbus Blue Jackets\nin 2012.\nA trade late in the\n2013\u201314 season\ncontributed to the Rangers reaching the\n2014 Stanley Cup Finals\n. On March 5, 2014, the Rangers traded their captain Ryan Callahan, along with a first-round draft pick in\n2015\n, a conditional second-round pick in\n2014\n, and a conditional seventh-round pick in 2015, for Tampa Bay captain\nMartin St. Louis\n. The trade occurred both due to the Rangers' and Callahan's inability to reach a contract extension, as well as St. Louis' growing tension with the Lightning organization and subsequent request to be traded to New York. The\n2013\u201314 Rangers\nwere already a strong team, setting a new franchise record of 25 road game wins. New York defeated Philadelphia in seven games in the first round of the\n2014 playoffs\n, and in the next round rallied from a 3\u20131 series deficit for the first time in their history to defeat Pittsburgh in seven games. They then defeated the Montreal Canadiens in six games to become the Eastern Conference champions, moving on to the Cup Finals, their first visit in 20 years, to face\n2012\nchampions\nLos Angeles Kings\n. The Rangers led the first two games by two goals but lost each game in overtime, and were then shut-out at home 3\u20130 in game 3. The Kings outshot the Rangers in game 4, but the Rangers staved off elimination by winning the game 2\u20131. They had another lead in game 5, but after the game was tied and subsequently sent to overtime, Kings defenseman\nAlec Martinez\nscored with 5:17 left in the second overtime period to win the game for Los Angeles, 3\u20132, as well as the Stanley Cup.\n[\n48\n]\nOn June 20, 2014, a week after their season ended, the Rangers\nbought-out\nthe remaining six years of Brad Richards' contract in order to free up\nsalary cap space\n.\n[\n49\n]\nOn October 6, defenseman\nRyan McDonagh\nwas named the Rangers' 27th captain in team history, with\nDerek Stepan\n, Dan Girardi, Marc Staal and Martin St. Louis serving as alternates. In\n2014\u201315\n, the Rangers won the Presidents' Trophy for the third time in franchise history and their seventh division title by finishing with the best record in the NHL at 53\u201322\u20137. The 53 wins and 113 points both set franchise records. The team also won 28 road games in the regular season, breaking the franchise record set the previous season. In the\n2015 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, the Rangers dispatched the Pittsburgh Penguins in five games in the first round. The Rangers then came back from a 3\u20131 series deficit to win their second-round series against the Capitals in seven games, becoming the first team in NHL history to battle back from a 3\u20131 deficit in back-to-back seasons and sending the Rangers to the conference finals for the third time in four years. However, after winning the first game against the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Rangers lost game 2 by four goals. The two teams split the first four games of the series, but the Rangers lost game 5 by a 2\u20130 scoreline at home. In game 6, Derick Brassard scored a hat-trick and assisted on two other goals in an emphatic 7\u20133 victory to force game 7 in New York.\n[\n50\n]\nThere, the Lightning shutout the Rangers 2\u20130, ending the Rangers' season, and marking the first occasion the Rangers had ever lost a game 7 at home in franchise history as well as the first time they lost an elimination game at home since they lost to Buffalo in\n2007\n.\n[\n51\n]\nOn June 27, 2015, the Rangers traded\nCarl Hagelin\nto the Anaheim Ducks,\nCam Talbot\nand a draft pick to the Edmonton Oilers, and prospect\nRyan Haggerty\nto the Chicago Blackhawks for\nAntti Raanta\n, who replaced Talbot as Lundqvist's backup goaltender.\n[\n52\n]\n[\n53\n]\nSubsequently, on July 1,\nGlen Sather\nresigned as the general manager, with\nJeff Gorton\ntaking his place to become the 11th general manager in team history.\n[\n54\n]\nOn July 2, Martin St. Louis announced his retirement.\n[\n55\n]\nThe team then re-signed\nJesper Fast\n,\nJ. T. Miller\n, and Derek Stepan.\n[\n56\n]\n[\n57\n]\n[\n58\n]\nThe Rangers started the\n2015\u201316 season\nwith a 14\u20132\u20132 record after 18 games, including a nine-game winning streak. However, the team lost their momentum and floundered, posting a 4\u20137\u20132 record in December for only ten points. After the holiday break, the team gradually improved their play, going on a 10\u20133\u20131 run without any back-to-back losses in February. The Rangers finished the season with 101 points for back-to-back 100+ point seasons. Despite high hopes, the Rangers were eliminated in the first round of the\n2016 Stanley Cup playoffs\nby a Penguins team that would go on to win the Stanley Cup. That summer, the Rangers extended Antti Raanta's contract,\n[\n59\n]\nsigned\nPavel Buchnevich\nto an entry-level contract,\n[\n60\n]\nand re-signed J. T.

In the first round of the\n2017 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, they won their series with the Montreal Canadiens in six games. In the second game of their second-round series with the Ottawa Senators, the Rangers held a two-goal lead on three different occasions, but lost in double overtime, putting themselves in a 2\u20130 series deficit. The team responded with consecutive 4\u20131 home wins in games 3 and 4 to tie the series, but lost the next two games and were eliminated.\nOn June 14, 2017, the Rangers announced a buyout of Dan Girardi's contract.\n[\n64\n]\nJust over a week later, the Rangers traded Derek Stepan and Antti Raanta to the\nArizona Coyotes\nin exchange for a first-round draft pick (seventh overall) and former first-round pick\nTony DeAngelo\n.\n[\n65\n]\nRangers' management also signed top free agent defenseman\nKevin Shattenkirk\nto a four-year deal.\n[\n66\n]\nHowever, injuries sidelined Shattenkirk, Kreider, and Zibanejad, and the Rangers struggled to compete.

The following day, the Rangers traded captain\nRyan McDonagh\nand\nJ. T. Miller\nto the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nfor picks and prospects.  With the team missing the playoffs for the first time since\n2010\n, finishing under .500 for the first time since\n2004\n, and placing last in the Metropolitan Division, head coach Vigneault was fired at the conclusion of the season.\n[\n67\n]\nOn May 23,\nDavid Quinn\nwas hired as the team's new head coach.\n[\n68\n]\nDuring the off-season, Hayes, Vesey,\nBrady Skjei\nand Spooner all filed for salary arbitration and all were re-signed.\n[\n69\n]\nGorton and his team remained committed to a rebuild in the\n2018\u201319 season\n, and with their playoff chances slim, the Rangers once again traded away veteran players at the deadline, including\nKevin Hayes\nand fan-favorite\nMats Zuccarello\n, who was sent to the Dallas Stars in exchange for two draft picks.\n[\n70\n]\n[\n71\n]\nThe Rangers received the second overall pick in the\n2019 NHL entry draft\n,\n[\n72\n]\nand subsequently used it to select forward\nKaapo Kakko\n.

By early March 2020, the Rangers were within striking distance of the second wild-card position when the\ncoronavirus pandemic\nhalted the regular season. In May 2020, the league announced a\n24-team playoff tournament\nto complete the season, where the Rangers were seeded 11th and faced the Carolina Hurricanes; the Hurricanes swept the Rangers. After being eliminated from the playoffs the Rangers were entered into the second phase of the NHL draft lottery where the team won the lottery and were awarded the first pick in the\n2020 NHL entry draft\n, which Gorton used to select\nAlexis Lafreniere\n.\n[\n80\n]\nLater in the off-season, the team traded veteran defenseman\nMarc Staal\nto the Red Wings.\nIn September 2020, the Rangers bought out the final year of\nHenrik Lundqvist\n's contract, ending his tenure in New York after 15 years.\n[\n81\n]\nThe Drury years (2020\u2013present)\n[\nedit\n]\nContinued team struggles (2020\u20132021)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn January 31, 2021, defenseman Tony DeAngelo was placed on waivers, following reports that he had an altercation with teammate\nAlexandar Georgiev\nfollowing an overtime loss.\n[\n82\n]\n[\n83\n]\nAccording to\nThe Athletic\n,\nhis continued \"maturity\" issues, combined with a marked decline in his play, led the Rangers to put him on the market; there were no takers.\n[\n84\n]\nIn a game against the\nWashington Capitals\non May 3, 2021, Capitals forward\nTom Wilson\ncross-checked\nPavel Buchnevich\nin the head and slammed\nArtemi Panarin\ninto the ice, ending his season.

Originally, the uniform was light blue, before it switched to a darker classic Rangers \"Broadway Blue\" in 1929. In addition, the original versions neither had a drop shadow nor were serifed. During the 1946\u201347 season, the word \"RANGERS\" was arranged in an arch form above the sweater number. It adopted its current form the next season, along with dropshadowed numbers, except for a brief period where the city name was used, a tie-down collar was not used and the tail and sleeve stripes were separated by thin blue stripes. Red pants have been used with the uniform since the 1929\u201330 season.\n[\n104\n]\nThe white jerseys were first unveiled in the 1951\u201352 season, as part of a mandate that regulated NHL teams to have a dark home jersey and a light away jersey. The\nserifed\nword \"RANGERS\" is also arranged diagonally, but in blue with red drop shadow. A quinticolor of blue, white and red stripes accentuate the tail and sleeves, while a blue shoulder yoke with white and red stripes completes the look. The white sweaters, with minor changes such as a tie-down collar and arched player names, have remained virtually unchanged since.\n[\n104\n]\nDuring the tenure of general manager\nJohn Ferguson Sr.\n, he sought to modernize the Rangers sweater by featuring rounded numbers, a darker shade of blue and the shield logo, which was unveiled in the 1976\u201377 season. A blue and red stripe (white and red stripe in the blue sweaters) extend from the yoke to the sleeves, while blue pants were used. However, it proved unpopular with the fans, and following the 1977\u201378 season it was replaced by an updated version of their classic uniforms. Ferguson used this similar design when he became general manager of the original\nWinnipeg Jets\n.\n[\n105\n]\nFrom 1996 to 2007 the Rangers' alternate jersey featured the head of the Statue of Liberty with the team abbreviation below it.\nThe modernized classic uniforms introduced in 1978 featured some subtle changes. Both jerseys featured a V-neck collar in a red-white-red pattern, and bolder stripes on the sleeves and waistline. On the blue jersey, the red and white stripes were separated by thin blue stripes, along with the waistline stripes being raised above the hemline so that the patterns on both jerseys matched. From 1978 to 1987, the blue jersey (then the road jersey) featured \"NEW YORK\" diagonally across the front instead of the traditional \"RANGERS\" wordmark, similar to their 2010s heritage alternate jerseys.\n[\n106\n]\nIn 1997, the Rangers reverted the blue jersey's design, restoring the old striping pattern, and becoming the first team to re-introduce lace-up collars.\n[\n107\n]\nThe white jerseys followed suit in 1999,\n[\n108\n]\nand the design was carried over to the Reebok Edge template in 2007.\n[\n109\n]\nOn October 7, 2001, the Rangers wore a modified version of their blue jerseys in a home game against the\nBuffalo Sabres\n. This design combined the current/traditional striping with the \"NEW YORK\" wordmark of the 1978\u20131987 uniforms. The uniforms were worn in the wake of the\nSeptember 11 attacks\n.\n[\n110\n]\nThe Rangers previously had a navy alternate jersey featuring the head of the\nStatue of Liberty\nwith the team abbreviation (NYR) below in a futuristic script. Silver was used as an accent color, but the player names and numbers retain the same color schemes as the regular jerseys, except for a darker shade of blue. Other than a white version used in the 1998\u201399 season, this jersey was used from 1996 to 2007, and proved to be highly popular with fans.\n[\n111\n]\nDuring the 2010\u201311 season, the Rangers debuted a heritage blue jersey as their new alternate uniform. The jersey featured a darker shade of blue, as well as a cream trim. Unlike the regular jerseys, the font of the alternate was\nsans-serif\nand did not feature a dropshadow, much like the original Rangers jersey. The Rangers wore the jerseys at home on Saturdays and when they played against Original Six teams.\n[\n104\n]\nFor the 2017\u201318 season, the heritage jersey was retired because of the league-wide switch to the\nAdidas\nuniform format.\nIn the\n2012 Winter Classic\n, the Rangers wore a cream jersey combining classic and current styles. A different version of the shield logo was used, while the player names were arranged in a straight line. The stripes were also lessened, giving it a minimalist, vintage look, as most Winter Classic jerseys are.\n[\n112\n]\nFor the\n2014 Stadium Series\n, the Rangers used white jerseys with the city name in navy, silver and red. In addition, they feature diagonal stripes and sleeve numbers, and enlarged numbers on the back to make them more readable to spectators. The chrome version of the shield logo is placed in the left shoulder. Like the Winter Classic sweaters, player names are in a straight position.\n[\n113\n]\nThe\n2018 Winter Classic\nsaw the Rangers wear a navy jersey with a combination of elements from prior uniform designs. The striping design was inspired from their current uniforms, while the white \"RANGERS\" wordmark was a nod from the team's late 1920s jerseys. A white silhouette of the Rangers' shield logo contained either the abbreviation \"N.Y.\" or the alternate captain \"A\" and captain \"C\" designations. Player names are arranged in a straight position.\n[\n114\n]\n[\n115\n]\nDuring the 2020\u201321 season, the Rangers released a \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform in collaboration with Adidas. The uniform featured the \"Lady Liberty\" design worn from 1996 to 2007, but with a few changes in the striping.\n[\n116\n]\nThis same design was again used for their 2022\u201323 \"Reverse Retro\" uniform, but the lighter Broadway Blue served as the base color while the lower sleeves were recolored red with white and navy stripes.\n[\n117\n]\nIntroduced in the 2023\u201324 season, the Rangers began wearing a new third jersey, bringing back the shield logo as the main crest for the first time since the 1976\u20131978 redesign. The navy blue-based jersey features thin white, red and Broadway blue stripes on the sleeves, waist and socks, along with white letters.\n[\n118\n]\nFor the\n2024 Stadium Series\n, the Rangers wore white jerseys with an enlarged \"NYR\" diagonal lettering in red with blue drop shadows. Enlarged numbers also employ the same color scheme as the \"NYR\" wordmark, along with thick alternating blue and red sleeve stripes.\n[\n119\n]\nSeason-by-season record\n[\nedit\n]\nThis is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Rangers.

The Islanders compete in the\nNational Hockey League\n(NHL) as a member of the\nMetropolitan Division\nin the\nEastern Conference\n. The team plays its home games at\nUBS Arena\n. The Islanders are one of three NHL franchises in the\nNew York metropolitan area\n, along with the\nNew Jersey Devils\nand\nNew York Rangers\n, and their fanbase resides primarily on\nLong Island\n.\nThe team was founded in\n1972\nas part of the NHL's maneuvers to keep a team from rival league\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) out of the newly built\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nin suburban\nUniondale, New York\n. After two years of building up the team's roster, they found almost instant success by securing 14 straight playoff berths starting with their third season. The Islanders won four consecutive\nStanley Cup\nchampionships between\n1980\nand\n1983\n, the eighth of nine\ndynasties\nrecognized by the NHL in its history. Their 19 consecutive playoff series wins between 1980 and 1984 is a feat that remains unparalleled in the history of professional sports. They are the last team in any major professional North American sport to win four consecutive championships, and to date the last NHL team to achieve a\nthree-peat\n.\nFollowing the team's dynasty era, the franchise ran into problems with money, ownership and management, an aging arena, and low attendance. Their woes were reflected on the ice, as the team has not won a division title since\n1987\u201388\n, and went 22 seasons without winning a playoff series prior to the\n2016 playoffs\n. After years of failed attempts to rebuild or replace Nassau Coliseum in suburban Long Island, the Islanders relocated to\nBarclays Center\nin Brooklyn following the\n2014\u201315 season\n.\n[\n4\n]\nIn the\n2018\u201319\nand\n2019\u201320\nseasons, the Islanders split their home games between Barclays Center and Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders played all their home games in the\n2020\u201321 season\nat Nassau Coliseum. Their\nnew arena\nnear\nBelmont Park\nwas opened in 2021.\nTen former members of the Islanders have been inducted into the\nHockey Hall of Fame\n, seven of whom\u2014\nMike Bossy\n,\nClark Gillies\n,\nDenis Potvin\n,\nBilly Smith\n,\nBryan Trottier\n, coach\nAl Arbour\n, and general manager\nBill Torrey\n\u2014were members of all four Cup-winning teams. Post-dynasty players\nPat LaFontaine\n,\nRoberto Luongo\nand\nPierre Turgeon\nwere also inducted.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe NHL heads to Long Island (1972\u20131974)\n[\nedit\n]\nIn fall 1972, the emerging\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) planned to place its New York team, the\nNew York Raiders\n, in\nNassau County\n's brand-new\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\n.\n[\n5\n]\nCounty officials did not consider the WHA a major league and wanted to keep the Raiders out.\n[\n6\n]\nWilliam Shea\n, who had helped bring\nMajor League Baseball\n's\nNew York Mets\nto the area a decade earlier, was enlisted to bring an NHL team to Long Island. Although Shea had previously worked with upstart rival leagues including the aborted\nContinental League\n, the\nAmerican Football League\nand the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n, his ultimate goal in these efforts had always been to try to persuade the established leagues to grant second franchises to New York as had been the case with the Mets (and also with the\nNew York Jets\nand\nNew York Nets\n, as a result of those teams' leagues merging with their established rivals).\nWilliam Shea\nplayed a major role in bringing a hockey team to Long Island.\nIn contrast, Shea decided there was no need to work with the WHA since unlike the initial results of his previous approaches to established leagues in the other major sports, Shea immediately found NHL president\nClarence Campbell\nto be receptive to adding a second team in New York. Nevertheless, the Islanders' bid faced opposition from the\nNew York Rangers\n, who did not want additional competition in the New York area.\n[\n7\n]\nEventually, Campbell and Shea persuaded the Rangers' owners,\nMadison Square Garden\n, to reconsider. Rangers' president\nBill Jennings\nweighed pros and cons. Another local NHL team would be compelled to compensate the Rangers for sharing the New York area. On the other hand, a WHA team would owe the Rangers nothing unless it was included in a potential NHL\u2013WHA merger, a prospect to which both Campbell and Jennings were adamantly opposed. Finally, consenting to the establishment of an NHL franchise in suburban Nassau County would help to ensure the vast majority of the Rangers' fanbase within New York City proper would continue to support the older franchise, and reduced the prospect of a rival league eventually establishing a team and fanbase there. Perhaps remembering the crucial role the Jets had played in ensuring the success of the AFL just a few years earlier as a challenger of the\nNational Football League\n, Jennings decided to help bring a new NHL team to the New York metropolitan area.\n[\n8\n]\nDespite expanding to 14 teams just two years prior, the NHL awarded a\nLong Island\n-based franchise to clothing manufacturer\nRoy Boe\n, owner of the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n's\nNew York Nets\n, on November 8, 1971.\n[\n8\n]\nThe terms included $6\u00a0million ($45.1\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) franchise fee plus a $5\u00a0million ($37.59\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) territorial fee to the Rangers.\n[\n10\n]\nAn expansion franchise was also given to\nAtlanta\n(the\nFlames\n) to keep the schedule balanced and to prevent the WHA from entering the growing market at the newly built\nOmni Coliseum\n.\n[\n7\n]\nThe New York Islanders name was unveiled by the franchise on February 15, 1972, at a\npress conference\nheld across the street from\nRoosevelt Raceway\nat a restaurant owned by\nBurt Bacharach\n.\n[\n11\n]\nMany expected it to use the \"\nLong Island Ducks\n\", after the\nEastern Hockey League\nteam that played from 1959 to 1973.\n[\n12\n]\nThe team was soon nicknamed the \"Isles\" by the local newspapers. The Islanders' arrival effectively doomed the Raiders, who played in Madison Square Garden under difficult lease terms and were forced to move to\nCherry Hill, New Jersey\nin the middle of their second season.\n[\n6\n]\nFormer\nCalifornia Golden Seals\nexecutive vice president\nBill Torrey\nwas named as the team's general manager at the same press conference as the franchise's name unveiling.\n[\n11\n]\nThe Islanders secured veteran forward\nEd Westfall\n, defenseman\nGerry Hart\n, and goaltender\nBilly Smith\nin the\n1972 expansion draft\n, along with\njunior ice hockey\nstars\nBilly Harris\n,\nLorne Henning\n, and\nBobby Nystrom\nin the\n1972 amateur draft\n.\n[\n13\n]\nSoon after the draft,\nPhil Goyette\nwas named as the team's first head coach, however he was fired halfway through the season and replaced with\nEarl Ingarfield\nand assistant coach\nAut Erickson\n.\n[\n14\n]\nUnlike most other expansion teams' general managers, Torrey made few trades for veteran players in the early years, as he was committed to building the team through the draft. Torrey stated, \"I told the owners that we're not going to beat this team next door by taking the castoffs from others teams. We'd have to develop our own stars.\"\n[\n13\n]\nBefore the season began, Westfall was named the team's first captain.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\nBy September 1972, the Islanders were waiting for the Nassau Coliseum to be completed as well as their practice facility \"The Royal Ice Rink\" in\nKings Park\n. The team was forced to practice as late as October 6, the day before their first game, at the Rangers practice rink in\nNew Hyde Park\n.\n[\n17\n]\nThe Islanders' first win came on October 12, 1972, in a 3\u20132 game against the\nLos Angeles Kings\n.\n[\n14\n]\nIn the team's first season, young players such as Smith, Nystrom, and Henning (all of whom would be part of the Islanders dynasty of the early 1980s) were given chances to prove themselves in the NHL. The young and inexperienced expansion team, however, posted a record of 12\u201360\u20136, setting an NHL record for most losses and worst overall record in a season.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n18\n]\nA highlight occurred on January 18, 1973, when they defeated the defending\nStanley Cup\nchampion\nBoston Bruins\n9\u20137.\n[\n14\n]\nFinishing last in the standings that season, they received the right to select first in the\n1973 draft\n.\n[\n18\n]\nOff the ice, the Islanders struggled financially, a situation that was exacerbated by the then-unprecedented $11 million in franchise and territorial fees.\nMontreal Canadiens\n' general manager\nSam Pollock\nwas keen to acquire the Islanders' pick so he could draft French Canadian junior star defenseman\nDenis Potvin\n, who had been touted as \"the next\nBobby Orr\n\" when he was 14 years old. Pollock made several lucrative trade offers including cash to the Islanders, but Torrey turned the Canadiens down and selected Potvin with the first overall pick.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n19\n]\nDuring the off-season, Torrey convinced former\nSt. Louis Blues\ncoach\nAl Arbour\nto come coach the Islanders.\n[\n8\n]\nEven with Arbour as the team's head coach and Potvin, who won the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\nas NHL Rookie of the Year, the team again finished last in the\nEast Division\nduring the\n1973\u201374 season\n, but allowed 100 fewer goals than the previous season. The season included their first win against the Rangers, on October 27, 1973,\n[\n5\n]\nwhich also happened to be the game where Potvin scored his first NHL goal. Although they failed to make the playoffs, their 56 points represented a 26-point improvement from the previous season.\n[\n8\n]\nAscendancy and playoff inability (1974\u20131979)\n[\nedit\n]\nDenis Potvin\nled the Islanders to playoff success in the 1970s and 1980s.\nWith the 4th and 22nd picks in the\n1974 draft\n, the Islanders added young forwards\nClark Gillies\nand\nBryan Trottier\nto continue Torrey's building plan.\n[\n20\n]\nIn the\n1974\u201375 season\n, the Islanders made one of the biggest turnarounds in NHL history. Led by Potvin, forwards Westfall, Harris, Nystrom, Gillies, and goaltenders Smith and\nGlenn \"Chico\" Resch\n, the team earned 88 points, 32 more than the previous season and two more than their first two seasons combined, earning their first playoff berth. They defeated the rival\nNew York Rangers\nin a best-of-3 first-round series as\nJ. P. Parise\nscored just 11 seconds into overtime of the third game.\n[\n8\n]\nIn the next round, down three games to none in a best-of-seven series against the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, the Islanders rallied to win the next four and take the series-winning game 7 on a late third-period goal by Westfall. Only four other major North American professional sports teams have accomplished this feat (the\n1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs\n,\n2004 Boston Red Sox\n, the\n2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers\n, and the\n2013\u201314 Los Angeles Kings\n).\n[\n21\n]\nThey were close but not as lucky in the following round, rallying from another 3\u20130 deficit to force a seventh game against the defending\nStanley Cup\nchampion\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nbefore the Flyers took the decisive seventh game at home and went on to win the Cup again.\n[\n8\n]\nDespite a disappointing playoff finish, Arbour remained complimentary of the team's attitude and maturity, saying \"If I called a practice next week, every one of them would show up.\"\n[\n22\n]\nThe Islanders continued their climb up the standings in\n1975\u201376\n, earning 101 points and the fifth-best record in the league.\n[\n23\n]\nIt was the first 100-point season in Islanders history, in only their fourth year of existence.\n[\n24\n]\nRookie center Trottier finished the season with 95 points and won the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n; his points and assists (63) totals set a new league record for most in each category by a rookie.\n[\n25\n]\nIt would be the first of four consecutive 100-point seasons, including the first two division titles in franchise history.\n[\n24\n]\n[\n26\n]\nDespite the emergence of young star players and regular season success between 1976 and 1979 the Islanders suffered a series of playoff disappointments. In\n1976\nand\n1977 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, the Islanders were knocked out in the semifinals by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the\nMontreal Canadiens\n.\n[\n27\n]\nThe Canadiens posted a 24\u20133 record in the playoffs during those two seasons with all three losses coming at the hands of the Islanders.\n[\n28\n]\nMike Bossy\nwas selected with the 15th overall pick in\n1977\nand became the third Islander to win the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n.\nIn the\n1977 draft\n, Torrey had the 15th overall pick and was deciding between forwards\nMike Bossy\nand\nDwight Foster\n. Bossy was known as an emerging scorer who lacked physicality. Foster was known as a solid\nchecker\nwith marginal offensive ability (despite having led the\nOntario Hockey League\nin scoring). Arbour persuaded Torrey to pick Bossy, arguing it was easier to teach a scorer how to check.\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nIn the\n1977\u201378 season\n, Bossy became the third Islander to win the Calder Trophy, and scored 53 goals that season, a rookie record at the time.\n[\n8\n]\nThe team earned their first Patrick Division and Campbell Conference championships.\n[\n14\n]\nSix players finished the season with 30 goals scored or more, with five of them Islanders draft picks, showing the success of the draft building process.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n31\n]\nThe season ended with a familiar result in the\nplayoffs\n, as the team lost in overtime in game 7 of the quarterfinals against the\nToronto Maple Leafs\n.\n[\n29\n]\nIn\n1978\u201379\n, the team finished with the best record in the NHL, clinching it with three goals in the third period of the season's final game against the Rangers. Trottier won the\nHart Memorial Trophy\nas league MVP and captured the\nArt Ross Trophy\nfor the most points, while sophomore Bossy scored 69 goals, which also led the league. Despite their regular season dominance, the Islanders exited the playoffs with another upset playoff loss, this time to the Rangers in the semifinals. As the team was leaving\nMadison Square Garden\nfollowing their game 6 elimination, Rangers fans rocked and threw objects at the team's bus. Hockey professionals and journalists generally questioned whether the Islanders were capable of winning the important games needed to win a Stanley Cup championship. Islander players would cite fear of repeating the pain of this loss as spurring their later success. After transferring the captaincy to Gillies the season before, Westfall retired and shortly thereafter became a color commentator on the team's telecasts.\nOff the ice, the Islanders were on shaky ground. Boe was losing money on both his franchises, even as the Islanders quickly surged to NHL prominence and the Nets became an ABA power. The Islanders were still far behind on the $10\u00a0million they had paid in startup costs, and the expansion and territorial fees associated with moving the Nets to the\nNational Basketball Association\nthrew Boe's finances into a tailspin. Eventually, Boe was forced to sell both his teams. He readily found a buyer for the Nets, but had less luck finding one for the Islanders. Torrey orchestrated a sale to one of the team's limited partners,\nJohn Pickett\n. In return, Pickett promoted Torrey to team president, though Torrey had already been operating head of the franchise before then. Soon after purchasing the team, Pickett signed a very lucrative\ncable television\ncontract with the fledgling\nSportsChannel\nnetwork as their owner,\nCharles Dolan\n, thought the up-and-coming Islanders would be a perfect centerpiece for his new network. Dolan gave Pickett a long-term guaranteed contract intended not only to keep the team on Long Island, but give area governments an incentive to renew his cable contracts. The Islanders have remained on the network, now known as\nMSG Sportsnet\n, for over four decades.\nThe Dynasty (1979\u20131983)\n[\nedit\n]\nAfter the Islanders' regular season dominance and playoff disappointment in 1979, Arbour decided that he would no longer concern himself too greatly with his team's finish in the regular season. Instead, he focused his team's energy on how they would perform in the playoffs. In\n1980\n, the Islanders dropped below the 100-point mark for the first time in five years, earning only 91 points. However, they finally broke through and won the\nStanley Cup\n.\nBefore the\n1980\nplayoffs, the Islanders acquired\nButch Goring\nfrom the\nLos Angeles Kings\n. Goring's arrival was often called the \"final piece of the puzzle.\"\nBefore the playoffs, Torrey made the difficult decision to trade longtime and popular veterans Billy Harris and defenseman\nDave Lewis\nto the\nLos Angeles Kings\nfor second line center\nButch Goring\n. Goring's arrival is often called the \"final piece of the puzzle\",\n[\n32\n]\na strong two-way player, his presence on the second line ensured that opponents would no longer be able to focus their defensive efforts on the Islanders' first line of Bossy, Trottier and\nClark Gillies\n. Contributions from new teammates, such as wingers\nDuane Sutter\nand\nAnders Kallur\nand\nstay-at-home defensemen\nDave Langevin\n,\nGord Lane\n, and\nKen Morrow\n(the latter fresh off a gold medal win at the\n1980 Olympics\n), also figured prominently in the Islanders' playoff success.\nIn the playoffs, the Islanders defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3\u20131 in the preliminary round, then beat the Boston Bruins 4\u20131 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, the Islanders faced the\nBuffalo Sabres\n, who had finished second overall in the NHL standings. The Islanders won the first two games in Buffalo, including a 2\u20131 victory in game two on\nBob Nystrom\n's goal in double overtime. They went on to win the series in six games and reach the finals for the first time in franchise history, where they would face the NHL's regular season champions, the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, who had gone undefeated for 35 straight games (25\u20130\u201310) during the regular season. In game one in\nPhiladelphia\n, the Islanders won 4\u20133 on\nDenis Potvin\n's power-play goal in overtime. Leading the series 3\u20132, they went home to Long Island for game six. In that game the Islanders blew a 4\u20132 lead in the third period but Nystrom continued his overtime heroics, scoring at 7:11 of the extra frame, on assists by John Tonelli and Lorne Henning, to bring Long Island its first Stanley Cup championship. This was the most recent Stanley Cup-clinching game won in overtime by the home team until the Los Angeles Kings did it in 2014. It was also the Islanders' sixth overtime victory of the playoffs. Bryan Trottier won the\nConn Smythe Trophy\nas the most valuable player in the playoffs. Torrey's strategy of building through the draft turned out very well; nearly all of the major contributors on the 1980 champions were home-grown Islanders or had spent most of their NHL careers in the Islanders organization. The Islanders were the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup with Europeans (\nStefan Persson\nand Kallur) on its roster.\n[\n33\n]\nThe Islanders dominated the next two seasons. Bossy scored\n50 goals in 50 games\nin\n1981\nand the Islanders lost only three playoff games en route to defeating the\nMinnesota North Stars\nin five games to win the Stanley Cup. Goring won the Conn Smythe Trophy. During their semifinals sweep of the Rangers, Islander fans began taunting the Rangers with a chant of \"\n1940!\n\"\u00a0\u2013 referring to the Rangers' last Stanley Cup win in\n1940\n(the Rangers would not win the cup again until\n1994\n). Fans in other NHL cities soon picked up the chant.\n[\n34\n]\nThese four banners hung in\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nand represent the four\nStanley Cup\nchampionships the Islanders won from 1980 through 1983.\nIn\n1981\u201382\n, the Islanders won a then-record 15 straight games en route to a franchise-record 118 points, while\nMike Bossy\nset a scoring record for right-wingers with 147 points in an 80-game schedule. The Islanders finished with the most points in the league (118), yet once in the playoffs against the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nthey found themselves down late in the third period of deciding game 5 before\nJohn Tonelli\nscored both the tying goal and the overtime winner. After defeating the Rangers in six games they swept both the\nQuebec Nordiques\nand the\nVancouver Canucks\nin the first-ever coast-to-coast\nStanley Cup Finals\nfor their third straight championship. During that series Bossy, upended by a check from\nTiger Williams\nand falling parallel to the ice, managed to hook the puck with his stick and score. Bossy netted the Stanley Cup-winning goal and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nThe next year, although the Islanders had won the Stanley Cup three straight times, more attention was being paid to the upstart\nEdmonton Oilers\n, whose young superstar\nWayne Gretzky\nhad just shattered existing scoring records.\n[\n35\n]\nIn\n1982\u201383\nthe Oilers had a better regular season, but the Islanders swept them in the\nStanley Cup Finals\nto win their fourth straight championship.\nBilly Smith\nwas named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner after shutting down the Oilers' vaunted scoring machine. Gretzky failed to score a goal during the series.\n[\n36\n]\nDuane and\nBrent Sutter\nscored seven and five points respectively in the first three games, while Bossy again scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in game four. After that game, the Oilers players walked past the Islanders' dressing room and were surprised to see the champions exhausted. Oilers players such as Gretzky and\nMark Messier\nsaid that they realized at that moment how much it would actually take to win the Stanley Cup.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\nPost-dynasty and the Easter Epic (1983\u20131991)\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders finished the\n1983\u201384 regular season\ntied atop the Prince of Wales Conference while successfully defending their Patrick Division title. The \"Drive for Five\" got off to a tense start. Late in the deciding game of their first-round series against the Rangers,\nDon Maloney\ntied the game with a controversial goal as the Islanders believed Maloney's stick was too high. They ultimately eliminated the Rangers for the fourth consecutive year. The team then defeated the\nWashington Capitals\nin five games and the\nMontreal Canadiens\nin six to set up a finals rematch with the Oilers. The series featured rookie\nPat LaFontaine\nscoring two third-period goals in 38 seconds. This time, the Oilers dethroned the Islanders to win the first of what would be five Stanley Cup victories in seven years. For the\n1984 playoffs\n, the NHL changed the home and away schedule for the finals, which provided the Islanders home-ice advantage in the series based on Wales Conference teams collectively having a winning record in regular season games versus Campbell Conference opponents,\n[\n38\n]\ndespite finishing lower than them in the overall standings. The new format had them play three straight games in Edmonton, where the Oilers managed to lock up the series, after the teams had split the first two games in New York. Bossy cited the team's hard time winning an away game as their downfall in the series.\n[\n39\n]\nThe Oilers also ended the Islanders' 19-series playoff winning streak. It remains the longest streak in the history of professional sports (one more than the 1959\u20131967 streak by the\nBoston Celtics\nof the NBA). Unlike the 1976\u20131979 Montreal Canadiens, who needed to win three series in the 1976 and 1977 playoffs under the playoff format in place at that time, the Islanders had to win four series in each of their Stanley Cup seasons.\nThe Islanders remained competitive for the rest of the decade, even as some of the stars from the Cup teams departed. As the decade wore on, Pickett began to keep the money from the team's cable deal rather than reinvest it in the team as he had done in years past. Although it did not become clear immediately, the lack of funds limited Torrey's ability to replace all of the departing talent. In the\n1984\u201385 NHL season\n, the Islanders slipped to third in their division, followed by similar results in the\n1985\u201386\nand\n1986\u201387\nseasons. They began facing stiff competition from division rivals, the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, who eliminated the Islanders in the division finals in 1985 and 1987, and the Capitals, who swept the Islanders' 1986 first-round series, the team's first exit without winning a playoff round since 1978.\nKelly Hrudey\n(pictured in 2006) saved 73 of 75 shots in the \"\nEaster Epic\n\" for the Islanders, who came out victorious after four periods of overtime play.\nIn 1986, Nystrom retired due to a serious injury\n[\n40\n]\nand\nClark Gillies\nwas picked up on waivers by the\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\n[\n41\n]\nArbour retired as coach following the\n1985\u201386 season\nand was replaced by longtime junior hockey coach\nTerry Simpson\n.\n[\n42\n]\nDuring the first round of the\n1987 playoffs\nagainst the Capitals, the Islanders had fallen behind in the series three games to one but were not eliminated due to a playoff format change from a best-of-5 series to a best-of-7.\n[\n43\n]\nThe Islanders evened the series, which set the stage for one of the most famous games in NHL history: the \"\nEaster Epic\n\".\nKelly Hrudey\nstopped 73 shots on goal while Pat LaFontaine scored at 8:47 of the fourth overtime\u2014and at 1:56\u00a0a.m. on\nEaster Sunday\nmorning. The win came even though the Islanders had been outshot 75\u201352.\n[\n44\n]\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\nThey were eliminated in the division finals in seven games by the Flyers.\n[\n47\n]\nChronic back pain forced\nMike Bossy\nto retire after the season.\n[\n48\n]\nThe\nfollowing season\n, the Islanders captured another division title,\n[\n49\n]\nbut were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the upstart\nNew Jersey Devils\n.\n[\n50\n]\nPotvin retired after the playoffs, holding records for most career goals (310), assists (742) and points (1052) by a defenseman, though he has since been passed in these categories by\nRay Bourque\nand\nPaul Coffey\n. Around this time, the team's run of good luck in the draft began to run out. Of their four top draft picks from 1987 to 1990, they lost one to a freak knee injury and two others never panned out.\n[\n51\n]\nThe\n1988\u201389 season\nsaw the Islanders win only seven of their first 27 games. Torrey fired Simpson and brought Arbour back. Arbour was unable to turn things around, and the team finished with 61 points, tied with the\nQuebec Nordiques\nfor the worst record in the league. It was their first losing season and the first time missing the playoffs since their second season. Smith, the last remaining original Islanders player, retired after the season to become the team's goaltending coach. Not long after the end of the season, Pickett moved to Florida and turned day-to-day operations over to a committee of four Long Island entrepreneurs: Ralph Palleschi, Bob Rosenthal,\nStephen Walsh\n, and\nPaul Greenwood\n. In return, they each bought a 2.5% interest in the team.\n[\n51\n]\nIn the\nnext season\n, the Islanders rebounded to get back into the playoffs, but fell to the Rangers in five games of the opening round. The team bought out the remaining years of\nBryan Trottier\n's contract, sending him off with a team record of games played. The\n1990\u201391 season\nhad the team finish well out of the playoffs after winning only 25 games.\nNew faces and the 1993 run (1991\u20131995)\n[\nedit\n]\nLaFontaine was frustrated with the team's lack of success and the progress of his contract negotiations, and held out rather than report to camp before\n1991\u201392\n. In response to the holdout, Torrey engineered a rebuilding project with two blockbuster trades on October 25, 1991. He dealt LaFontaine,\nRandy Wood\nand\nRandy Hillier\n(along with future considerations) to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin return for\nPierre Turgeon\n,\nBenoit Hogue\n,\nUwe Krupp\nand\nDave McLlwain\n. He also sent longtime captain\nBrent Sutter\nand\nBrad Lauer\nto the\nChicago Blackhawks\nfor\nSteve Thomas\nand\nAdam Creighton\n. With these additions and a talented core of players such as\nDerek King\n,\nRay Ferraro\n, and\nPatrick Flatley\n, along with incoming\nSoviet\nplayers\nVladimir Malakhov\nand\nDarius Kasparaitis\n, the Islanders had a new foundation in the early 1990s. The management committee, however, was not nearly as patient as Boe and Pickett had been, and forced Torrey to resign after the Islanders missed the playoffs again that season. Assistant general manager\nDon Maloney\nwas hired in Torrey's place,\n[\n51\n]\nwhile Torrey quickly resurfaced with the expansion\nFlorida Panthers\n.\nIn Maloney's first year,\n1992\u201393\n, the Islanders rebounded to make the playoffs, in the process surpassing the 80-point mark for the first time in five years. The LaFontaine-Turgeon trade proved successful for both the Islanders and Sabres, as both players hit career highs in points and Turgeon won the\nLady Byng Trophy\n.\nRay Ferraro emerged as a playoff hero, scoring a pair of overtime winners in the first-round series against the Capitals. Instead of celebrating after winning game 6 at Nassau Coliseum, however, the Islanders were both irate and despondent. Only seconds after Turgeon, the team's star center and leading scorer, scored an insurance goal in the series-clinching game,\nDale Hunter\nviolently checked him from behind. Turgeon was believed to be out for the entire second round, if not longer, with a separated shoulder. He returned only for spot power-play duty in the last game of the second round. Hunter received a 21-game suspension, at the time the longest for on-ice misconduct in modern NHL history.\nThe Islanders' next opponent, the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, were twice-defending Stanley Cup champions and full of stars such as\nMario Lemieux\n,\nJaromir Jagr\n, and\nRon Francis\n. The Penguins had roared through the regular season with 119 points, as well as recording a record 17 consecutive wins towards the end of the season, and were overwhelmingly favored to win a third straight championship. Jim Smith of\nNewsday\npredicted that with Turgeon on the sidelines, the Penguins would sweep the Islanders out of the playoffs, however on the strength of outstanding goaltending from\nGlenn Healy\nand contributions from all four lines, the Islanders achieved a huge upset when\nDavid Volek\nscored at 5:16 of overtime of the deciding seventh game.\nNewsday'\ns front page the day following the win was a picture of Healy with a headline reading, \"It's a Miracle!\" This was the last playoff series won by the Islanders for 23 years, until the 2015\u201316 season. Turgeon returned to the Islanders' top line for the conference finals against the\nMontreal Canadiens\n, though he was not in peak form as he had not fully recovered. The Islanders bowed out of the playoffs after a hard-fought five games, two of which went to overtime. After beating the Islanders, the Canadiens went on to win the Cup.\nMaloney had avoided making many personnel changes his first year, but on the eve of the\n1993 expansion draft\nhe traded backup goaltender\nMark Fitzpatrick\nto the\nQuebec Nordiques\nfor\nRon Hextall\n. The clubs also exchanged first-round picks in the deal. Able to protect only one netminder in the expansion draft, the Islanders left Healy exposed. He was claimed by the\nMighty Ducks of Anaheim\n, then was claimed by the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nin Phase II of the draft the next day, and finally had his rights traded to the Rangers, where he became the backup.\nThe Islanders barely squeezed past the Panthers to make the 1994 playoffs before being swept in a lopsided opening series by the first-place Rangers, who went on to win the Cup. It would be the Islanders' last playoff appearance until\n2002\n. Arbour retired for good as coach and was succeeded by longtime assistant\nLorne Henning\n. Hextall, who allowed 16 goals in three games, drew most of the criticism for the failed playoff campaign and was shipped to Philadelphia for\nTommy Soderstrom\nin September. In the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season, the Islanders not only failed to qualify for the playoffs, they finished ahead of only the third-year\nOttawa Senators\n.\nManagement issues (1995\u20132000)\n[\nedit\n]\nBy the end of the 1994\u201395 season, Maloney was under considerable heat from the press and fan base for his handling of the team. Since taking over in 1992, the only noticeable attempt he made to upgrade the roster was the acquisition of Hextall. Near the end of the failed 1995 campaign, Maloney decided that the core of players he had left alone for three seasons needed to be revamped, leading to a rebuilding project. He traded Turgeon and Malakhov to the\nMontreal Canadiens\nfor\nKirk Muller\nand\nMathieu Schneider\n, while Hogue was sent to\nToronto\nfor young goaltender\nEric Fichaud\n. Additionally, Maloney allowed the team's leading scorer, Ferraro, to depart as an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of the season. Fans' displeasure at Maloney for trading the popular Turgeon was magnified when Muller balked at joining a rebuilding team. He played 45 games for the Islanders before being sent to Toronto as well.\nBefore the\n1995\u201396 season\n, Maloney fired Henning and named\nMike Milbury\nhead coach. The same year, the Islanders' attempt at updating their look resulted in the unveiling of a new team logo of a slicker-clad fisherman holding a hockey stick. Islanders fans disliked it, and rival Rangers' fans mockingly called the Islanders \"\nfishsticks\n\"\u2014mocking how the logo resembled the\nGorton's Fisherman\n. The team reverted to a modified version of the old logo as soon as the league allowed them to do so. (In spite of this, the logo found renewed popularity as a throwback design in the late 2010s and early 2020s, enough so that the team would revive it as their third \"Reverse Retro\" jersey in 2022 and would use an adjusted version of the logo for their AHL team, the\nBridgeport Islanders\n, beginning in 2024.) The year was a disappointment on the ice as well, as the Islanders finished in last place with a record of 22\u201350\u201310. During the season, team management fired Maloney, whom fans blamed for the team's downfall,\n[\n52\n]\nand gave Milbury full control of hockey operations as both a coach and general manager. Milbury went on to resign as head coach during the\nfollowing season\nand elevated assistant\nRick Bowness\nto the position. After another unsuccessful season with little improvement, Milbury took over as coach again during the\n1997\u201398 season\n. The team improved to fourth place in their division but again failed to make the playoffs. Milbury followed by once again stepping down as coach during the\nfollowing season\nwhile retaining his job as general manager.\nDuring the continued playoff drought, instability in the front office mirrored the Islanders' substandard performance on the ice. Pickett sold the team to\nDallas\nbusinessman\nJohn Spano\nin 1996. However, three months after the 1997 closing, Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of the first installment on the cable rights deal. Several Islanders executives tipped off\nNewsday\nthat something was amiss about their new boss.\n[\n53\n]\nIn July,\nNewsday\nexposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required to complete the deal. The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth, and also had two lawsuits pending against him. Within days of the report, Spano was forced to relinquish the team to Pickett. Federal prosecutors turned up evidence that Spano had forged many of the documents used to vouch for his wealth and to promise payment to Pickett, and even appeared to have sent many of the documents from his own office in Dallas. He was sentenced to 71 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. The NHL took additional heat when reports surfaced that the league spent well under $1,000 (depending on the source, the league spent either $525\n[\n53\n]\nor $750\n[\n51\n]\n) to check Spano's background. It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners. The incident and its aftermath were covered in the\nESPN\n30 for 30\ndocumentary,\nBig Shot\n.\n[\n54\n]\nPickett finally found a buyer, a group led by\nHoward Milstein\nand\nPhoenix Coyotes\nco-owner Steven Gluckstern, a deal which almost fell through when\nSpectacor Management Group\n, which managed the Coliseum for Nassau County, tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was safe. Pickett refused, since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in recent seasons. SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders, the NHL, and Nassau County officials.\nInitially, the team made numerous trades and increased their payroll in an effort to assemble a better team. In one transaction, young players\nTodd Bertuzzi\nand\nBryan McCabe\nwere traded for veteran\nTrevor Linden\n. After the Islanders finished 12 points short of the playoffs in the 1997\u201398 season, however, Milstein and Gluckstern decided to run the team on an austere budget in an attempt to make a profit. They also complained about the condition of the Nassau Coliseum and made noises about moving the team elsewhere. They began trading or releasing many popular players to avoid paying their salaries, including star scorer\nZigmund Palffy\n, team captain Linden, former rookie of the year\nBryan Berard\n, and rugged defenseman\nRich Pilon\n. Losing the highly regarded players, the team finished with similar results the next two seasons. Attendance, which had been in a steady decline over the past few years, decreased even further to under 12,000 per game. Around that time, Milstein bid hundreds of millions of dollars in unsuccessful attempts to purchase the\nNational Football League\n's\nWashington Redskins\nand\nCleveland Browns\n.\nNew ownership and a return to the playoffs (2000\u20132006)\n[\nedit\n]\nLet's face it, the Coliseum is a dump, and the team, well, they're losers. It's a real shame. We want to see it change because this is our home. We all deserve better.\n\u2014\nCharles Wang\n[\n55\n]\nIn 2000, Milstein and Gluckstern sold the team to\nComputer Associates\nexecutives\nCharles Wang\nand\nSanjay Kumar\n. The sale cost $187.5\u00a0million ($342.36\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) and gave fans hope for the team to turn its lack of success around.\n[\n55\n]\nThe new owners allowed Milbury to spend money and invest in free agents. His first attempt proved unpopular with fans, as he traded away future star players\nRoberto Luongo\nand\nOlli Jokinen\nto the\nFlorida Panthers\nfor\nOleg Kvasha\nand\nMark Parrish\n. Milbury then further surprised the hockey world when he took\nRick DiPietro\nwith the first selection in the\n2000 draft\n, ahead of consensus picks\nDany Heatley\nand\nMarian Gaborik\n. Reporters and fans were alternately confused and enraged by the moves, which Milbury acknowledged, saying, \"As dangerous as this may be, we think Mad Mike maybe has something going for him.\"\n[\n56\n]\nEstablishing a record of controversial decisions, Milbury held onto the \"Mad Mike\" nickname for years to follow. He remained adamant that his moves were to immediately improve the team, whose poor winning percentage that year was ahead of only the franchise's first season.\n[\n57\n]\nThe team's uninspired play led Milbury to fire head coach and past player\nButch Goring\n. Fans vocalized their dislike of Goring taking the fall rather than Milbury, which was further worsened when Milbury passed on hiring\nTed Nolan\nas Goring's successor; Instead,\nBoston Bruins\nassistant coach\nPeter Laviolette\nwas hired.\n[\n58\n]\nThe Islanders acquired\nAlexei Yashin\n(left) prior to the\n2001\u201302 season\n. Yashin would go on to become the team's captain in later years.\nThree key personnel acquisitions were made prior to the 2001\u201302 season, Laviolette's first.\nAlexei Yashin\nwas acquired from the\nOttawa Senators\nin exchange for forward\nBill Muckalt\n, defenseman\nZdeno Chara\nand the Islanders' second overall pick in the\n2001 draft\n. Next, Islanders prospects\nTim Connolly\nand\nTaylor Pyatt\nwere traded to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin exchange for\nMichael Peca\n, who became the team's captain.\n[\n59\n]\n[\n60\n]\nBy virtue of finishing with the worst record in the previous season,\nDetroit Red Wings\ngoaltender\nChris Osgood\nwas the next addition, taken as the first pick in the September 2001 waiver draft, adding a former Stanley Cup championship goaltender without giving up any players in exchange.\n[\n61\n]\nThe additions proved to be a great help, as the team opened the season with a 9\u20130\u20131\u20131 record, the best in franchise history. They finished the season with new broken records; their 96 points marked the fourth biggest one-year turnaround in the league's history (44 points higher than the previous season), while Osgood's 66 starts surpassed\nRon Hextall\n's previous record of 65.\n[\n22\n]\nDuring the\n2002 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, they were seeded fifth and faced the fourth-seeded\nToronto Maple Leafs\n. The Islanders lost in a very physical first-round series in seven games; the home team won every game of the series. Notably, game 5 featured\nGary Roberts\ncharging Islander defenseman\nKenny Jonsson\n, and\nDarcy Tucker\nsubmarining Peca with a questionable check that tore the Islander captain's\nanterior cruciate ligament\n, sidelining both players for the series' final game. The situation between Tucker and Peca caused a bit of outrage, with speculation that Tucker had intended to injure Peca before the game had begun, which Tucker denied.\n[\n62\n]\nDespite the promise shown in the Toronto playoff series, the Islanders had a slow start to the\n2002\u201303 season\n. They rebounded to make the playoffs, but lost a five-game series in the first round to the top-seeded\nOttawa Senators\n.\n[\n63\n]\nMilbury continued his controversial move-making by firing Laviolette after the season, citing postseason interviews with the players in which they expressed a lack of confidence in the coach.\n[\n64\n]\nHe was replaced with\nSteve Stirling\n, who had previously been coaching the team's top minor league affiliate, the\nBridgeport Sound Tigers\n. In the\nfollowing season\n, the Islanders again lost in the first round of the playoffs, this time to the eventual champion\nTampa Bay Lightning\n.\n[\n65\n]\nFollowing the\n2004\u201305 NHL lockout\n, which eliminated that season of play, the Islanders made several player moves to increase offense for\nfollowing season\n. Peca was traded to the\nEdmonton Oilers\nfor center\nMike York\n, freeing up room under the NHL's new salary cap.\n[\n66\n]\nThe same day, the team signed winger\nMiroslav Satan\nto play alongside Yashin.\n[\n67\n]\nMilbury also worked on remaking the team's defense, adding\nAlexei Zhitnik\n,\nBrad Lukowich\nand\nBrent Sopel\nto replace the departed\nAdrian Aucoin\nand\nRoman Hamrlik\n, who left as free agents, and Jonsson, who left the NHL to play in the\nHockeyAllsvenskan\nin Sweden.\n[\n68\n]\nIn the aftermath, Yashin was named as the team's new captain.\n[\n69\n]\nThe team's inconsistent play led to Stirling's dismissal midway through the season.\n[\n14\n]\nManagement shake-ups and the DiPietro contract (2006\u20132009)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn the day of Stirling's firing, January 11, 2006, Milbury also announced that he would step down as general manager once a successor was found.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n70\n]\nHe served as vice president of Wang's sports properties for one year before resigning in May 2007.\n[\n71\n]\nWang proceeded by hiring\nNeil Smith\nas general manager and\nTed Nolan\nas head coach, following a brief stint by\nBrad Shaw\nas the team's interim head coach.\n[\n72\n]\n[\n73\n]\nSmith, however, was fired after approximately one month and quickly replaced by the team's backup goaltender\nGarth Snow\n, who retired from his playing career to accept the position.\n[\n22\n]\nBefore his dismissal, Smith made several free agent acquisitions, including defensemen\nBrendan Witt\nand\nTom Poti\n, and forwards\nMike Sillinger\nand\nChris Simon\n.\n[\n72\n]\nOn September 12, 2006, the Islanders signed DiPietro to a 15-year, $67.5\u00a0million ($105.28\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) contract, which was believed to be the longest contract to date in the NHL and the second-longest in North American sports, behind a 25-year contract for\nNational Basketball Association\nplayer\nMagic Johnson\n.\n[\n74\n]\n[\n75\n]\nDiPietro, Wang and Snow all spoke confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides, despite the mixed reactions it received from the rest of the hockey world. Specifically, Wang stated, \"This is not a big deal. You have to have a commitment to who you're working with.\"\n[\n74\n]\nAs speculation began as to whether other teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players,\nAtlanta Thrashers\n' general manager\nDon Waddell\nfelt that, \"It's highly unlikely that you will see teams go beyond that. This is a once-in-a-lifetime contract. Ownership must feel very strongly that he's their guy for the next 15 years.\"\n[\n75\n]\nBill Guerin\nwas the team captain from 2007 to 2009.\nThe new-look Islanders were picked by most analysts to languish towards the bottom of the standings.\n[\n76\n]\nEyeing a playoff spot, Snow traded for forward\nRyan Smyth\nfrom the\nEdmonton Oilers\nat the trade deadline on February 27, 2007.\n[\n77\n]\nInjuries to DiPietro provided extra setbacks, but not enough to drop the team from playoff contention.\n[\n78\n]\n[\n79\n]\nThey qualified for the playoffs, assisted by a late-season winning streak and a 3\u20132 shootout victory against the\nNew Jersey Devils\nin their final regular season game.\n[\n80\n]\nDespite DiPietro's return to the team in time for the playoffs, the team lost their first round matchup in five games to the\nPresidents' Trophy\n-winning\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\n[\n81\n]\nManagement announced in June 2007 that they would buy out captain\nAlexei Yashin\n's contract, which had four seasons remaining on it.\n[\n82\n]\nFree agents Smyth, Poti,\nViktor Kozlov\n,\nJason Blake\n, and\nRichard Zednik\nalso left in July 2007.\n[\n83\n]\n[\n84\n]\nDuring that month, the Islanders signed\nBill Guerin\nto a two-year contract as he immediately assumed team captaincy.\n[\n83\n]\nAlso in the off-season, free agents\nMike Comrie\n,\nAndy Sutton\nand\nJon Sim\njoined the team.\n[\n85\n]\n[\n86\n]\nThat summer, it was announced that Nolan extended an invitation to Al Arbour to return as a coach for one game in order to bring his total number of games coached to 1,500.\n[\n87\n]\n[\n88\n]\nArbour signed a one-day contract, the shortest in league history, on November 3, 2007; it put him behind the bench the following day as the Islanders defeated the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n3\u20132, raising his career coaching win total to 740.\n[\n89\n]\nThe team remained in the playoff hunt through the trade deadline as they re-signed Comrie to a one-year contract and traded away Simon and\nMarc-Andre Bergeron\n.\n[\n90\n]\nA rash of injuries saw them plummet to the fifth-worst record in the league by the end of the season.\n[\n91\n]\nJosh Bailey\nwas drafted by the Islanders in 2008, to provide depth at the wing for the team.\nAt the\n2008 NHL entry draft\n, the Islanders made two trades to move down from the fifth to the ninth overall pick, with which they selected center\nJosh Bailey\n. They also added free agents\nMark Streit\nand\nDoug Weight\n. The team dismissed head coach\nTed Nolan\nover alleged philosophy differences,\n[\n92\n]\n[\n93\n]\nand later that summer replaced him with\nScott Gordon\n.\n[\n94\n]\nNear the trade deadline, Snow traded Comrie and\nChris Campoli\nto the\nOttawa Senators\nin exchange for forward\nDean McAmmond\nand the\nSan Jose Sharks\n' first-round draft pick in the\n2009 NHL entry draft\nand sent captain Bill Guerin to the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin exchange for a conditional draft pick.\n[\n95\n]\n[\n96\n]\nIn the\n2008\u201309 season\n, the Islanders finished in last place in the league with a record of 26\u201347\u20139, which was the team's worst record since the 2000\u201301 season. After the conclusion of regular season, they won the draft lottery to retain the first overall pick in the\n2009 NHL entry draft\n.\n[\n97\n]\nThe Tavares era begins (2009\u20132015)\n[\nedit\n]\nBeginning an effort to rebuild the team with new and young talent, the Islanders selected\nJohn Tavares\nwith the first-overall pick of the\n2009 NHL entry draft\n.\n[\n98\n]\nTavares went into the draft as the top prospect in the majority of scouting reports,\n[\n99\n]\nand it was widely expected that the Islanders would select him after they secured the first overall pick by winning the draft lottery, although there was plenty of competition between Tavares,\nVictor Hedman\n, and\nMatt Duchene\n.\n[\n100\n]\nNHL Central Scouting Bureau\n's Chris Edwards spoke highly of him, stating, \"[Tavares] is phenomenal at getting the puck through traffic to his linemates, getting to opening. The way he reads the play and can get to where he figures the rebounds will be and bangs in the rebound. He's a real smart player.\"\n[\n101\n]\nThey traded up twice in the first round to also select defenseman\nCalvin de Haan\nwith the 12th overall pick,\n[\n102\n]\nas well as\nCasey Cizikas\nand\nAnders Lee\nin later rounds, all of whom would go on to play consistently on the main roster by the\n2014\u201315 season\n.\n[\n103\n]\nThe\n2009\u201310 season\nstarted out slow, with the team winless its first six games.\n[\n104\n]\nThe team continued to play inconsistently due to injuries as many wrote them off as potential playoff contenders.\n[\n105\n]\nThe team hit a mid-season hot streak,\n[\n106\n]\nhowever nine losses in 11 games before the Olympic break set them right back.\n[\n107\n]\nThey ultimately ended up at bottom of the standings again, finishing the season 26th in the league.\n[\n108\n]\nThe placement led to a fifth overall pick in\n2010\n. Continuing with their rebuilding process, they used the first round to draft young forwards\nNino Niederreiter\nand\nBrock Nelson\nwith picks five and 30, respectively.\n[\n109\n]\nAs the\n2010\u201311 season\ngot underway, the team quickly fell into a ten-game losing streak, leading to the firing of head coach\nScott Gordon\n.\n[\n110\n]\n[\n111\n]\nHe was replaced on an interim basis by\nJack Capuano\n, who had been coaching the Bridgeport Sound Tigers.\n[\n111\n]\n[\n112\n]\nEarly in the season, they also acquired\nMichael Grabner\nfrom waivers, who went on to score 34 goals and was selected as a finalist for the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n;\n[\n113\n]\n[\n114\n]\nhe would go on to sign a five-year contract with the team at the end of the season.\n[\n114\n]\nThis year also featured the\nPenguins\u2013Islanders brawl\n, which resulted in a combined 346 penalty minutes and a $100,000 fine to the Islanders for \"failure to control their players\".\nJohn Tavares\n, was named an alternate captain for the\n2011\u201312 season\n. He was later named the team captain in 2013.\nThe\nfollowing season\nwas a breakout year for Tavares. The newly named assistant captain gained 31 goals and 50 assists,\n[\n115\n]\nin addition to being selected to play in the\n59th NHL All-Star Game\nat the age of 21;\n[\n116\n]\nhis 81 points were seventh-best in the league.\n[\n117\n]\nTavares' left-winger\nMatt Moulson\nalso had a strong season, finishing with career highs of 36 goals, 33 assists and 69 points.\n[\n118\n]\nDespite strong seasons from their top players, the team finished 27th in the league with a record of 34\u201337\u201311, continuing their pattern of racking up top prospects with early picks at the drafts.\n[\n119\n]\nThey used the first round of the\n2012 draft\nto select defenseman\nGriffin Reinhart\nwith the fourth overall pick.\n[\n120\n]\nOn August 1, 2011, voters in\nNassau County\nrejected a proposal for a new arena to replace Nassau Coliseum. This followed the failed decade-long attempt by owner Charles Wang to build a mixed-use development called\nThe Lighthouse Project\n, which would have renovated the arena.\n[\n121\n]\nIn the wake of the vote, speculation began that the team would eventually move to\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\n, new arenas in\nQueens\nor\nSuffolk County\n, the\nSprint Center\nin\nKansas City\n, or the\nVideotron Centre\nin\nQuebec City\n, the last of which was coincidentally set to open at the same time as the expiration of the Islanders' lease on the Nassau Coliseum in 2015.\n[\n122\n]\n[\n123\n]\n[\n124\n]\nOn October 24, 2012, the Islanders made the announcement that the franchise would indeed be moving to the\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\nfor the 2015\u201316 NHL season, after signing a lease that would keep the team in the arena until 2040. The team retained its name, logo and colors as part of the move.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n125\n]\nAs part of the deal, the management of Barclays Center took over the team's business operations once the Islanders moved to Barclays Center.\n[\n126\n]\nThe decision to move to Brooklyn didn't require the Rangers' approval. Under a longstanding provision of the agreement that allowed the Islanders to share the New York area with the Rangers, the Islanders are allowed to play their games anywhere on Long Island, including the two city boroughs on the island, Brooklyn and\nQueens\n.\n[\n127\n]\nBeginning on April 1, 2013, of the\n2012\u201313 season\n, the team went on a near month-long unbeaten streak in regulation time, posting a 12-game streak of earning points until falling to the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nlater that month.\n[\n128\n]\nDuring that streak, on April 23, 2013, they clinched their first playoff berth since 2007 with a 4\u20133 shootout loss to the\nCarolina Hurricanes\n, ending a six-year playoff drought.\n[\n128\n]\n[\n129\n]\nBehind goaltender\nEvgeni Nabokov\n, the team was ultimately eliminated in six games by the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin the first round of the\nplayoffs\n, continuing their winless streak in playoff series.\n[\n130\n]\n[\n131\n]\nOn September 10, 2013, Tavares was introduced as the 14th captain in New York Islanders history, replacing former Islander Mark Streit of the Philadelphia Flyers, who served as team captain since 2011.\n[\n132\n]\nAfter posting a 4\u20134\u20133 record in their first 11 games, the Islanders made a trade, sending fan favorite and three-time 30-goal scorer Matt Moulson, their 2014 first-round draft pick and their 2015 second-round draft pick to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin exchange for\nThomas Vanek\n, a highly regarded and dynamic goal scorer.\n[\n133\n]\n[\n134\n]\nDespite chemistry with linemates Tavares and\nKyle Okposo\n, however, his desire to test free agency and the team's impending move to\nBarclays Center\n[\n135\n]\nled to Vanek being dealt to the\nMontreal Canadiens\nat the trade deadline for\nSebastian Collberg\nand a second-round pick in\n2014\n.\n[\n136\n]\n[\n137\n]\nAfter a season of player swapping and goaltending issues, they failed to qualify for the\nplayoffs\n, finishing with a record of 34\u201337\u201311.\n[\n138\n]\nThe Islanders acquired\nNick Leddy\nthrough a trade with the\nChicago Blackhawks\nduring the 2014 off-season.\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Islanders made several moves to improve the team before their\nfinal season\nat Nassau Coliseum. In May, the Islanders acquired the rights to\nJaroslav Halak\nfrom the\nWashington Capitals\nin exchange for a fourth-round pick in 2014. Halak was then signed to a four-year contract. The Islanders also signed\nMikhail Grabovski\n,\nNikolai Kulemin\nand goaltender\nChad Johnson\nas free agents. Additionally, on October 4, the Islanders acquired\nJohnny Boychuk\nfrom the\nBoston Bruins\nfor two-second round picks in 2014 and\n2015\nand a conditional third-round pick in 2015, as well as\nNick Leddy\nfrom the\nChicago Blackhawks\nin exchange for prospect\nVille Pokka\n,\nT. J. Brennan\nand the rights to\nAnders Nilsson\n.\nThe NHL Board of Governors approved the Islanders' sale to businessmen\nJon Ledecky\nand\nScott D. Malkin\nin October 2014. Ledecky and Malkin served as minority partners during a two-year transition period. At the end of the 2015\u201316 season, they formally took majority control from Wang, who retained a share of the franchise.\n[\n139\n]\nThe Islanders finished the 2014\u201315 regular season with a record of 47\u201328\u20137 for 101 points, and met the Washington Capitals in the first round of the\n2015 playoffs\n. The Capitals held home-ice advantage in the series after the Islanders lost their final regular season game to the\nColumbus Blue Jackets\n, 5\u20134, in a shootout, as the Islanders lost the season series to the Capitals after posting a 2\u20131\u20131 record in the season series (Washington went 2\u20130\u20132, winning the season series with six points to the Islanders' five). On April 19, 2015, in the third game of their first-round series against Washington, John Tavares scored 15 seconds into overtime to win the game for the Islanders, 2\u20131. It was the second-shortest overtime playoff game in Islanders history, and was the first overtime, game-winning goal for the Islanders in the playoffs since 1993. The Islanders lost the fourth and fifth games of their series before rebounding in the sixth game to force a seventh game in the series. However, they were denied entry into the second round by a single goal and would ultimately fall to the Capitals in seven games.

The Islanders posted the fourth-best penalty kill rate and allowed the fewest power-play goals during the season. However, in the last quarter of the regular season, some players, including Halak and defenseman\nTravis Hamonic\n, suffered key injuries. The team finished the regular season fourth in the Metropolitan Division with 100 points, enough to clinch the first wild card spot in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced off against the\nFlorida Panthers\n; goaltender\nThomas Greiss\nonly played in 40 minutes of playoff hockey with the\nSan Jose Sharks\nprior to this series. Both teams split the first four games of the series. The fifth game of the series proved to be a major turning point, as late season call-up\nAlan Quine\nscored the game-winning goal on the power play with four minutes left in double overtime to end the second-longest game in franchise history; that goal gave them a 3\u20132 series lead and a chance to clinch the series on home ice. In the sixth game, the Islanders trailed 1\u20130 for much of the game, but Tavares tied it late in the third period. Tavares would score again with the series-clinching goal in double overtime to give the Islanders their first playoff series win since 1993. In the second round of the playoffs, they faced the Tampa Bay Lightning for the first time since 2004. Despite winning the first game of the series, the Islanders lost their series to the Lightning in five games.\nAndrew Ladd\nprior to a game during the\n2016\u201317 season\n.

Having carried three goaltenders for the second consecutive season, the decision was made to stick with the tandem of Greiss and back-up\nJean-Francois Berube\nafter Halak posted a 6\u20138\u20135 record with a .904 save percentage through the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season.\n[\n145\n]\nIn late January 2017, following a report by\nBloomberg News\nwhich speculated that Barclays Center was considering removing the Islanders due to poor attendance and effects on the venue's profit margins (reception to Barclays Center as a hockey venue was mixed partly due to obstructed view seats,\n[\n146\n]\nas well as features like an off-center scoreboard, and the Islanders had the third-worst average attendance in the entire league while playing at the venue),\nNewsday\nreported that Nassau County executive Edward Mangano had met with one of the team's co-owners, and told the paper that it was possible that the Islanders could return to the renovated Nassau Coliseum.\n[\n147\n]\n[\n148\n]\nHowever, commissioner\nGary Bettman\nconsidered the concept to be \"unviable\" (the renovation reduced the capacity of the arena to just under 14,000, which is smaller than any NHL arena), and noted that Ledecky and Malkin were pursuing a possible arena project at\nBelmont Park\n.\n[\n149\n]\nDespite winning their last six games of the 2016\u201317 season, the Islanders finished in ninth place in the Eastern Conference; they missed the playoffs by only one point when the Toronto Maple Leafs clinched the final playoff spot on the penultimate day of the season.\nEmergence of Barzal and management overhaul (2017\u2013present)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn February 9, 2018, rookie\nMathew Barzal\nrecorded his third five-point game, becoming only the second rookie to do so since\nJoe Malone\nin 1917\u201318 and tying a 100-year-old record in the process.\n[\n150\n]\nAt the end of the 2017\u201318 regular season, Barzal had 85 points (22 goals, 63 assists). He led his team and all NHL rookies in points, and was tied for 13th overall in scoring in the NHL. Barzal was the seventh rookie in NHL history, and first since\nSidney Crosby\nin 2005\u201306, to have scored at least 20 goals and 60 assists in a single season.\n[\n151\n]\nBarzal also tied Islanders legend,\nBryan Trottier\n's franchise record for rookie assists.\n[\n152\n]\nBarzal won the Calder Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year for his 85-point season, leading the closest candidate by 20 points and receiving 160 out of 164 first-place votes. Barzal was the first Islanders' player to win the award since\nBryan Berard\nin 1997, and he was the fifth Islanders' player overall to win the trophy, joining Islanders legends\nMike Bossy\n(1978), Trottier (1976), and\nDenis Potvin\n(1974).\n[\n151\n]\nIslanders players after a win against the\nColorado Avalanche\non January 6, 2020\nDuring the 2018 off-season, the Islanders announced that former\nNew Jersey Devils\nand\nToronto Maple Leafs\ngeneral manager\nLou Lamoriello\nwas named their president of hockey operations, with \"full authority over all hockey matters with the organization\", and would become general manager on June 5, 2018, replacing\nGarth Snow\n.\n[\n153\n]\n[\n154\n]\nAdditionally,\nBarry Trotz\nwas hired as head coach of the Islanders. Trotz resigned from the Washington Capitals one month prior after coaching them to their first Stanley Cup championship since they entered the NHL in 1974.\n[\n155\n]\nCaptain John Tavares' contract with the team expired following the 2017\u201318 season, and despite attempts to re-sign him,\n[\n155\n]\nhe joined the Toronto Maple Leafs as a free agent.\n[\n156\n]\nIn the 2018\u201319 season, the Islanders split their home games between Barclays Center and their former home, Nassau Coliseum. The use of both arenas would continue over the course of the following two seasons until the completion of a new 18,000-seat arena at\nBelmont Park\nin\nElmont\n.\n[\n157\n]\n[\n158\n]\n[\n159\n]\nThe Islanders enjoyed success throughout the 2018\u201319 season, clinching a playoff berth at home for the first time in 17 years, and the first time in March since 1990.\n[\n160\n]\n[\n161\n]\n[\n162\n]\nNassau Coliseum hosted their home playoff games during the first round while the Barclays Center hosted their home games for the rest of the playoffs.\n[\n159\n]\n[\n163\n]\nIn the first round of the\n2019 playoffs\n, the Islanders swept the Pittsburgh Penguins, and in the second round the team was swept by the\nCarolina Hurricanes\n.\n[\n164\n]\nSince November 2021, the Islanders have played their home games at UBS Arena in\nElmont, New York\n.\nOn August 8, 2019, the\nEmpire State Development Corporation\nboard (ESD) voted unanimously in favor of the Belmont Park Arena project.\n[\n165\n]\nIn February 2020, it was announced that the Islanders would return to Nassau Coliseum for the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs and the 2020\u201321 season until\nUBS Arena\nwas opened.\n[\n166\n]\n[\n167\n]\nBoth the 2019\u201320 season and the construction of the new arena were interrupted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n. When the NHL season was suspended on March 12, 2020, the Islanders had twelve regular season games remaining and were one point shy of the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\n[\n168\n]\nThe Islanders qualified for the NHL Return-to-Play initiative as the seventh seed, beating the\nFlorida Panthers\nin four games in a best-of-5 qualifying round to make the\n2020 Stanley Cup playoffs\n. They would then go on to defeat the\nWashington Capitals\nin the first round in five games. Then, after blowing a 3\u20131 series lead to the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nthat extended the series to seven games, the Islanders would go on to win game 7 against the Flyers and advance to the conference finals for the first time since the\n1993 playoffs\n. However, their run would come to an end at the hands of the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nin six games. In December 2020, New York Islanders Hockey Club, L.P. bought the remaining 15 percent stake of the team from the\nestate of Charles Wang\nand took full ownership of the team.\n[\n169\n]\n[\n170\n]\n[\n171\n]\nThe Islanders again made the playoffs in the shortened 2020\u201321 season, defeating the Penguins and Bruins each in six games. They again lost to the Tampa Bay Lightning, this time in seven.\nThe Islanders started the 2021\u201322 season on a 13-game road trip while\nUBS Arena\nwas finalizing construction, finishing their road trip with a 5\u20136\u20132 record.\n[\n172\n]\nHowever, minutes before the first home game of the season on November 20, 2021, many Islander players contracted COVID-19 and missed the home opener and several others. Longest tenured Islander\nJosh Bailey\nand team captain\nAnders Lee\nmissed the game, while\nAdam Pelech\n,\nAnthony Beauvillier\n, and\nAndy Greene\nwere ruled out minutes before puck drop.\n[\n173\n]\nThey lost the home opener to the\nCalgary Flames\nby a score of 5\u20132.\n[\n174\n]\nBrad Richardson\nscored the first goal in UBS Arena history, while\nBrock Nelson\nscored the first Islander goal.\n[\n174\n]\nThe Islanders won their first game at UBS Arena against the Devils, on December 11, by a score of 4\u20132. Former Devils captain\nZach Parise\nscored the game-winning goal for the Islanders.\n[\n175\n]\nThe Islanders missed the playoffs after three consecutive trips, finishing the season with a 37\u201335\u201310 record.\n[\n176\n]\nOn May 9, 2022, head coach Barry Trotz was relieved from his duties,\n[\n177\n]\nand replaced with\nLane Lambert\n.\n[\n178\n]\nIn the\nnext season\n, the Islanders finished as the first wild card, but were defeated by the Carolina Hurricanes in the first round of the\n2023 playoffs\n.\nAfter an inconsistent start to the\n2023\u201324 season\n, head coach Lane Lambert was fired on January 20, 2024, and\nPatrick Roy\nwas hired as his replacement.\n[\n179\n]\n[\n180\n]\nThe Islanders finished in third place in the Metropolitan Division and lost to the Carolina Hurricanes in the first round of the\n2024 playoffs\n.\nAfter a disappointing\n2024\u201325 season\nwhere the team finished 35\u201335\u201312 and missing the playoffs by nine points, the Islanders announced on April 22, 2025, that they would not be renewing Lamoriello's contract, effectively ending his time as general manager and president of hockey operations.\n[\n181\n]\nDespite having only the 10th-best odds, the Islanders won the\n2025 NHL draft lottery\nacquiring the right select first overall for the first time since 2009.\n[\n182\n]\nIn the off-season,\nMathieu Darche\nreplace Lamoriello as general manager.\n[\n183\n]\nTeam identity\n[\nedit\n]\nLogo\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders' first logo, used from 1972 to 1995; a similar logo with a slight difference in colors was used from 1997 to 2010.\nThe club's current wordmark logo.\nAdvertising executive John Alogna created the original Islanders logo, a circle with the letters \"NY\" over a map of the\nNassau\nand\nSuffolk\ncounties. The lower part of the Y is made to resemble a hockey stick, with three orange stripes near the bottom of the shaft and a puck to the right of the stick blade. At the bottom of the logo, the name of the team is written so that the tip of the \"I\" ends in a point aimed at\nUniondale\n, the location of Nassau Coliseum.\nBefore the\n1995\u201396 season\n, the Islanders attempted to update their look by introducing a new logo depicting a fisherman holding a hockey stick. The new logo was a marketing disaster; the reaction among the fanbase was so negative that management announced it would revert to the original logo as soon as league rules allowed them to do so. Many found that the logo bore a strong resemblance to the\nGorton's fisherman\n; indeed,\nNew York Rangers\nfans taunted the Islanders with chants of \"We want\nfishsticks\n!\" long after the logo was discarded.\n[\n184\n]\nThe traditional logo was phased back in over the next two seasons, starting as an\nalternate jersey\nlogo in\n1996\u201397\nbefore fully replacing the fisherman in\n1997\u201398\n. The only change to the classic logo at this time was its colors; as the team had replaced its original royal blue with navy, the logo was recolored to match.\nThe short-lived \"Fisherman\" logo, used from 1995 to 1997\nBeginning in\n2008\u201309\n, the Islanders introduced another modification to their original logo for their new third jersey. The \"new\" logo, once again in royal blue, now features four orange stripes on the hockey stick instead of three, representing the four consecutive Stanley Cup titles won by the team in the 1980s. This became the team's full-time logo in 2010.\nFor their\n2014 Stadium Series\nspecial jerseys, the Islanders used a simplified jersey logo with just the \"NY\" from their regular logo. Versions of that have since appeared on third jersey designs.\nJerseys\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders debuted in 1972 with traditional-style jerseys: one was white with orange and royal blue stripes near the waistline and on the sleeves, the other was royal blue with white and orange stripes. The design remained largely the same, with only minor tweaks through the\n1994\u201395 season\n.\nPrior to the\n1995\u201396 season\n, team executives decided to change the jersey. The fisherman logo replaced the \"NY\" circular design, incorporating navy blue and a brighter orange, and introducing teal and gray shades. The team was seeking increased merchandise revenues, with the outward justification of connecting the team more overtly to Long Island. The jersey included a lighthouse shoulder patch, a reference to the\nMontauk Lighthouse\n, and featured uneven stripes resembling an ocean wave near the waistline, on the sleeves, and across the shoulders. All of the numbering and lettering on the jerseys also followed the wave pattern.\n[\n185\n]\nLate in the season, the team eliminated the fisherman logo, but league rules forbade them from switching jersey designs for the\n1996\u201397 season\non only a few months' notice. Instead, they debuted their first\nthird (and fourth) jerseys\n, which were identical to the home and road jerseys worn by the team, except the circular \"NY\" crest, now colored in the navy blue and bright orange shades to match, replaced the fisherman logo. The team wore these jerseys in approximately 15 games during that season and adopted them permanently in the\n1997\u201398 season\n.\nThe shoulder logo used on Islanders jerseys from 1998 through 2010\nPrior to the\n1998\u201399 season\n, the team's jerseys reverted to a traditional design but kept the navy blue and bright orange shades from the jerseys used the previous three seasons. They added a shoulder patch of four bars, alternating in color, to represent the Islanders' four Stanley Cup championships. A predominantly orange third jersey was introduced in\n2002\u201303\n, featuring navy blue yokes and sides that formed sharp points on the sleeves and body. The team wore this jersey through the\n2006\u201307 season\n.\nFor the\n2007\u201308 season\n, the Islanders redesigned their uniforms as all NHL teams changed over to the\nReebok Edge\nsystem. These jerseys resembled the prior design but included uniform numbers on the right chest above the logo. The name plates were also in two colored format: white on orange on the navy blue home jersey and navy blue on orange on the white road jersey. The sleeves on both jerseys were orange, with a wide navy stripe above a thin white stripe at the elbow. The jerseys had a thin stripe tracing around the shoulders, and featured \"retro\" laces at the neck.\nA royal blue throwback design was introduced the following season as a third jersey. Before the\n2010\u201311 season\n, the Islanders made this throwback design their new home jersey. A corresponding new white road jersey was unveiled during the Islanders'\ndraft\nparty at Nassau Coliseum.\n[\n186\n]\nFor the following season, they unveiled an alternate jersey in black with grey on the shoulder yoke. The front of the jersey bore the team name above the player's number in orange with blue and white trim. The Islanders crest was placed on the shoulder yoke. Diagonal side panels, blue trimmed in orange and gray, combined with similar panels on the black pants to form a diamond shape on the sides of each player. These were only used sparing for two seasons, as they proved unpopular.\nDuring the\n2014 Stadium Series\n, the Islanders wore a special edition jersey. The front side featured the \"NY\" from the primary logo in a special chrome treatment, while the back side featured a white nameplate with blue letters for player names, and bigger numbers in white trimmed in orange for visibility purposes. The sleeve numbers were also angled diagonally. The primary Islanders logo would be placed on the left shoulder within the white yoke. This jersey was promoted to an alternate third jersey in the\n2014\u201315 season\n, replacing the black third jersey. During that season, on February 3, 2015, the team wore an updated version of the fisherman jersey for warmups before their game against the\nFlorida Panthers\n.\n[\n187\n]\n[\n188\n]\nThe Islanders retired the Stadium Series third jersey after only one season, replacing it with a new black alternate that was unveiled to coincide with the team's move to Brooklyn. Unlike the previous black alternate, this version featured little blue and orange at all (these colors appear only on the rear collar), while the \"NY\" insignia that was carried over from the Stadium Series jersey was stripped of its chrome accents. The four narrow white stripes on the sleeves symbolize the franchise's four Stanley Cup wins.\nWhen the NHL switched to\nAdidas\nas its uniform provider in 2017, the Islanders kept their primary jerseys mostly intact except for the restoration of the blue trim in the primary logo on the road jersey. As with all NHL teams, the Islanders only wore two jerseys for the 2017\u201318 season, thus retiring the all-black third jerseys.\nThe Islanders released a new blue third jersey for the 2018\u201319 season, featuring an updated \"NY\" insignia (shorter \"Y-stick\" with four orange stripes on the blade), white shoulder yoke (reminiscent of the 2014 Stadium Series alternates), the map of Long Island on the collar, and orange numbers that call back to the jerseys used during the team's inaugural season.\n[\n189\n]\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the Islanders released a special \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform. The uniform resembled their current home jerseys, but used the navy blue and bright orange scheme worn from 1995 to 2010.\n[\n190\n]\nA second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was released in the 2022\u201323 season, using the \"Fisherman\" uniform from 1995 to 1997 but with less teal elements and diagonal orange striping.\n[\n191\n]\nDuring the\n2024 Stadium Series\n, the Islanders wore navy blue jerseys with a thick orange middle stripe. \"ISLES\" in navy blue letters was added within the orange stripe, as are the navy blue numbers.\n[\n192\n]\nThe Islanders reverted to wearing only their primary jerseys after\nFanatics\ntook over as the NHL uniform provider in 2024, even though it kept most aspects of Adidas' template and retained the use of third jerseys.\nMascot and Ice Girls\n[\nedit\n]\nIce Girls at a community event in 2013\nThe Islanders' team mascot is named \"\nSparky the Dragon\n\", who served at one point as cross-promotion with the\nArena Football League\n's\nNew York Dragons\nteam, who also played their home games at Nassau Coliseum. In the mid-1990s, the Islanders had a mascot named \"Nyisles\" whose body style went from round to human-shaped, and facial features vaguely resembled the logo fisherman, excluding its red hair and beard. Nyisles was discontinued toward the end of the\n1997\u201398 season\nwhen the team distributed \"Who kidnapped Nyisles?\" flyers implying the reason for his disappearance was because of another NHL mascot, ultimately revealed to be\nToronto Maple Leafs\nmascot\nCarlton the Bear\n. Nyisles returned as the secondary mascot of the club with a brand new look in December 2022 to coincide with the return of the Fisherman logo on the team's reverse retro uniforms.\n[\n193\n]\nFrom the 2001\u201302 season to the 2014\u201315 season, the Islanders also had an ice crew named the \"Ice Girls\", made up of only women who skated onto the ice during television breaks to clean up the snow that piled up during the game. The Ice Girls were also used for promotional purposes during games and at community events. Starting in the 2015\u201316 season, a co-ed ice crew would replace the Ice Girls.\nSeason-by-season record\n[\nedit\n]\nThis is only a partial list of the last five seasons.

The Islanders compete in the\nNational Hockey League\n(NHL) as a member of the\nMetropolitan Division\nin the\nEastern Conference\n. The team plays its home games at\nUBS Arena\n. The Islanders are one of three NHL franchises in the\nNew York metropolitan area\n, along with the\nNew Jersey Devils\nand\nNew York Rangers\n, and their fanbase resides primarily on\nLong Island\n.\nThe team was founded in\n1972\nas part of the NHL's maneuvers to keep a team from rival league\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) out of the newly built\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nin suburban\nUniondale, New York\n. After two years of building up the team's roster, they found almost instant success by securing 14 straight playoff berths starting with their third season. The Islanders won four consecutive\nStanley Cup\nchampionships between\n1980\nand\n1983\n, the eighth of nine\ndynasties\nrecognized by the NHL in its history. Their 19 consecutive playoff series wins between 1980 and 1984 is a feat that remains unparalleled in the history of professional sports. They are the last team in any major professional North American sport to win four consecutive championships, and to date the last NHL team to achieve a\nthree-peat\n.\nFollowing the team's dynasty era, the franchise ran into problems with money, ownership and management, an aging arena, and low attendance. Their woes were reflected on the ice, as the team has not won a division title since\n1987\u201388\n, and went 22 seasons without winning a playoff series prior to the\n2016 playoffs\n. After years of failed attempts to rebuild or replace Nassau Coliseum in suburban Long Island, the Islanders relocated to\nBarclays Center\nin Brooklyn following the\n2014\u201315 season\n.\n[\n4\n]\nIn the\n2018\u201319\nand\n2019\u201320\nseasons, the Islanders split their home games between Barclays Center and Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders played all their home games in the\n2020\u201321 season\nat Nassau Coliseum. Their\nnew arena\nnear\nBelmont Park\nwas opened in 2021.\nTen former members of the Islanders have been inducted into the\nHockey Hall of Fame\n, seven of whom\u2014\nMike Bossy\n,\nClark Gillies\n,\nDenis Potvin\n,\nBilly Smith\n,\nBryan Trottier\n, coach\nAl Arbour\n, and general manager\nBill Torrey\n\u2014were members of all four Cup-winning teams. Post-dynasty players\nPat LaFontaine\n,\nRoberto Luongo\nand\nPierre Turgeon\nwere also inducted.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe NHL heads to Long Island (1972\u20131974)\n[\nedit\n]\nIn fall 1972, the emerging\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) planned to place its New York team, the\nNew York Raiders\n, in\nNassau County\n's brand-new\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\n.\n[\n5\n]\nCounty officials did not consider the WHA a major league and wanted to keep the Raiders out.\n[\n6\n]\nWilliam Shea\n, who had helped bring\nMajor League Baseball\n's\nNew York Mets\nto the area a decade earlier, was enlisted to bring an NHL team to Long Island. Although Shea had previously worked with upstart rival leagues including the aborted\nContinental League\n, the\nAmerican Football League\nand the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n, his ultimate goal in these efforts had always been to try to persuade the established leagues to grant second franchises to New York as had been the case with the Mets (and also with the\nNew York Jets\nand\nNew York Nets\n, as a result of those teams' leagues merging with their established rivals).\nWilliam Shea\nplayed a major role in bringing a hockey team to Long Island.\nIn contrast, Shea decided there was no need to work with the WHA since unlike the initial results of his previous approaches to established leagues in the other major sports, Shea immediately found NHL president\nClarence Campbell\nto be receptive to adding a second team in New York. Nevertheless, the Islanders' bid faced opposition from the\nNew York Rangers\n, who did not want additional competition in the New York area.\n[\n7\n]\nEventually, Campbell and Shea persuaded the Rangers' owners,\nMadison Square Garden\n, to reconsider. Rangers' president\nBill Jennings\nweighed pros and cons. Another local NHL team would be compelled to compensate the Rangers for sharing the New York area. On the other hand, a WHA team would owe the Rangers nothing unless it was included in a potential NHL\u2013WHA merger, a prospect to which both Campbell and Jennings were adamantly opposed. Finally, consenting to the establishment of an NHL franchise in suburban Nassau County would help to ensure the vast majority of the Rangers' fanbase within New York City proper would continue to support the older franchise, and reduced the prospect of a rival league eventually establishing a team and fanbase there. Perhaps remembering the crucial role the Jets had played in ensuring the success of the AFL just a few years earlier as a challenger of the\nNational Football League\n, Jennings decided to help bring a new NHL team to the New York metropolitan area.\n[\n8\n]\nDespite expanding to 14 teams just two years prior, the NHL awarded a\nLong Island\n-based franchise to clothing manufacturer\nRoy Boe\n, owner of the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n's\nNew York Nets\n, on November 8, 1971.\n[\n8\n]\nThe terms included $6\u00a0million ($45.1\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) franchise fee plus a $5\u00a0million ($37.59\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) territorial fee to the Rangers.\n[\n10\n]\nAn expansion franchise was also given to\nAtlanta\n(the\nFlames\n) to keep the schedule balanced and to prevent the WHA from entering the growing market at the newly built\nOmni Coliseum\n.\n[\n7\n]\nThe New York Islanders name was unveiled by the franchise on February 15, 1972, at a\npress conference\nheld across the street from\nRoosevelt Raceway\nat a restaurant owned by\nBurt Bacharach\n.\n[\n11\n]\nMany expected it to use the \"\nLong Island Ducks\n\", after the\nEastern Hockey League\nteam that played from 1959 to 1973.\n[\n12\n]\nThe team was soon nicknamed the \"Isles\" by the local newspapers. The Islanders' arrival effectively doomed the Raiders, who played in Madison Square Garden under difficult lease terms and were forced to move to\nCherry Hill, New Jersey\nin the middle of their second season.\n[\n6\n]\nFormer\nCalifornia Golden Seals\nexecutive vice president\nBill Torrey\nwas named as the team's general manager at the same press conference as the franchise's name unveiling.\n[\n11\n]\nThe Islanders secured veteran forward\nEd Westfall\n, defenseman\nGerry Hart\n, and goaltender\nBilly Smith\nin the\n1972 expansion draft\n, along with\njunior ice hockey\nstars\nBilly Harris\n,\nLorne Henning\n, and\nBobby Nystrom\nin the\n1972 amateur draft\n.\n[\n13\n]\nSoon after the draft,\nPhil Goyette\nwas named as the team's first head coach, however he was fired halfway through the season and replaced with\nEarl Ingarfield\nand assistant coach\nAut Erickson\n.\n[\n14\n]\nUnlike most other expansion teams' general managers, Torrey made few trades for veteran players in the early years, as he was committed to building the team through the draft. Torrey stated, \"I told the owners that we're not going to beat this team next door by taking the castoffs from others teams. We'd have to develop our own stars.\"\n[\n13\n]\nBefore the season began, Westfall was named the team's first captain.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\nBy September 1972, the Islanders were waiting for the Nassau Coliseum to be completed as well as their practice facility \"The Royal Ice Rink\" in\nKings Park\n. The team was forced to practice as late as October 6, the day before their first game, at the Rangers practice rink in\nNew Hyde Park\n.\n[\n17\n]\nThe Islanders' first win came on October 12, 1972, in a 3\u20132 game against the\nLos Angeles Kings\n.\n[\n14\n]\nIn the team's first season, young players such as Smith, Nystrom, and Henning (all of whom would be part of the Islanders dynasty of the early 1980s) were given chances to prove themselves in the NHL. The young and inexperienced expansion team, however, posted a record of 12\u201360\u20136, setting an NHL record for most losses and worst overall record in a season.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n18\n]\nA highlight occurred on January 18, 1973, when they defeated the defending\nStanley Cup\nchampion\nBoston Bruins\n9\u20137.\n[\n14\n]\nFinishing last in the standings that season, they received the right to select first in the\n1973 draft\n.\n[\n18\n]\nOff the ice, the Islanders struggled financially, a situation that was exacerbated by the then-unprecedented $11 million in franchise and territorial fees.\nMontreal Canadiens\n' general manager\nSam Pollock\nwas keen to acquire the Islanders' pick so he could draft French Canadian junior star defenseman\nDenis Potvin\n, who had been touted as \"the next\nBobby Orr\n\" when he was 14 years old. Pollock made several lucrative trade offers including cash to the Islanders, but Torrey turned the Canadiens down and selected Potvin with the first overall pick.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n19\n]\nDuring the off-season, Torrey convinced former\nSt. Louis Blues\ncoach\nAl Arbour\nto come coach the Islanders.\n[\n8\n]\nEven with Arbour as the team's head coach and Potvin, who won the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\nas NHL Rookie of the Year, the team again finished last in the\nEast Division\nduring the\n1973\u201374 season\n, but allowed 100 fewer goals than the previous season. The season included their first win against the Rangers, on October 27, 1973,\n[\n5\n]\nwhich also happened to be the game where Potvin scored his first NHL goal. Although they failed to make the playoffs, their 56 points represented a 26-point improvement from the previous season.\n[\n8\n]\nAscendancy and playoff inability (1974\u20131979)\n[\nedit\n]\nDenis Potvin\nled the Islanders to playoff success in the 1970s and 1980s.\nWith the 4th and 22nd picks in the\n1974 draft\n, the Islanders added young forwards\nClark Gillies\nand\nBryan Trottier\nto continue Torrey's building plan.\n[\n20\n]\nIn the\n1974\u201375 season\n, the Islanders made one of the biggest turnarounds in NHL history. Led by Potvin, forwards Westfall, Harris, Nystrom, Gillies, and goaltenders Smith and\nGlenn \"Chico\" Resch\n, the team earned 88 points, 32 more than the previous season and two more than their first two seasons combined, earning their first playoff berth. They defeated the rival\nNew York Rangers\nin a best-of-3 first-round series as\nJ. P. Parise\nscored just 11 seconds into overtime of the third game.\n[\n8\n]\nIn the next round, down three games to none in a best-of-seven series against the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, the Islanders rallied to win the next four and take the series-winning game 7 on a late third-period goal by Westfall. Only four other major North American professional sports teams have accomplished this feat (the\n1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs\n,\n2004 Boston Red Sox\n, the\n2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers\n, and the\n2013\u201314 Los Angeles Kings\n).\n[\n21\n]\nThey were close but not as lucky in the following round, rallying from another 3\u20130 deficit to force a seventh game against the defending\nStanley Cup\nchampion\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nbefore the Flyers took the decisive seventh game at home and went on to win the Cup again.\n[\n8\n]\nDespite a disappointing playoff finish, Arbour remained complimentary of the team's attitude and maturity, saying \"If I called a practice next week, every one of them would show up.\"\n[\n22\n]\nThe Islanders continued their climb up the standings in\n1975\u201376\n, earning 101 points and the fifth-best record in the league.\n[\n23\n]\nIt was the first 100-point season in Islanders history, in only their fourth year of existence.\n[\n24\n]\nRookie center Trottier finished the season with 95 points and won the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n; his points and assists (63) totals set a new league record for most in each category by a rookie.\n[\n25\n]\nIt would be the first of four consecutive 100-point seasons, including the first two division titles in franchise history.\n[\n24\n]\n[\n26\n]\nDespite the emergence of young star players and regular season success between 1976 and 1979 the Islanders suffered a series of playoff disappointments. In\n1976\nand\n1977 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, the Islanders were knocked out in the semifinals by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the\nMontreal Canadiens\n.\n[\n27\n]\nThe Canadiens posted a 24\u20133 record in the playoffs during those two seasons with all three losses coming at the hands of the Islanders.\n[\n28\n]\nMike Bossy\nwas selected with the 15th overall pick in\n1977\nand became the third Islander to win the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n.\nIn the\n1977 draft\n, Torrey had the 15th overall pick and was deciding between forwards\nMike Bossy\nand\nDwight Foster\n. Bossy was known as an emerging scorer who lacked physicality. Foster was known as a solid\nchecker\nwith marginal offensive ability (despite having led the\nOntario Hockey League\nin scoring). Arbour persuaded Torrey to pick Bossy, arguing it was easier to teach a scorer how to check.\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nIn the\n1977\u201378 season\n, Bossy became the third Islander to win the Calder Trophy, and scored 53 goals that season, a rookie record at the time.\n[\n8\n]\nThe team earned their first Patrick Division and Campbell Conference championships.\n[\n14\n]\nSix players finished the season with 30 goals scored or more, with five of them Islanders draft picks, showing the success of the draft building process.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n31\n]\nThe season ended with a familiar result in the\nplayoffs\n, as the team lost in overtime in game 7 of the quarterfinals against the\nToronto Maple Leafs\n.\n[\n29\n]\nIn\n1978\u201379\n, the team finished with the best record in the NHL, clinching it with three goals in the third period of the season's final game against the Rangers. Trottier won the\nHart Memorial Trophy\nas league MVP and captured the\nArt Ross Trophy\nfor the most points, while sophomore Bossy scored 69 goals, which also led the league. Despite their regular season dominance, the Islanders exited the playoffs with another upset playoff loss, this time to the Rangers in the semifinals. As the team was leaving\nMadison Square Garden\nfollowing their game 6 elimination, Rangers fans rocked and threw objects at the team's bus. Hockey professionals and journalists generally questioned whether the Islanders were capable of winning the important games needed to win a Stanley Cup championship. Islander players would cite fear of repeating the pain of this loss as spurring their later success. After transferring the captaincy to Gillies the season before, Westfall retired and shortly thereafter became a color commentator on the team's telecasts.\nOff the ice, the Islanders were on shaky ground. Boe was losing money on both his franchises, even as the Islanders quickly surged to NHL prominence and the Nets became an ABA power. The Islanders were still far behind on the $10\u00a0million they had paid in startup costs, and the expansion and territorial fees associated with moving the Nets to the\nNational Basketball Association\nthrew Boe's finances into a tailspin. Eventually, Boe was forced to sell both his teams. He readily found a buyer for the Nets, but had less luck finding one for the Islanders. Torrey orchestrated a sale to one of the team's limited partners,\nJohn Pickett\n. In return, Pickett promoted Torrey to team president, though Torrey had already been operating head of the franchise before then. Soon after purchasing the team, Pickett signed a very lucrative\ncable television\ncontract with the fledgling\nSportsChannel\nnetwork as their owner,\nCharles Dolan\n, thought the up-and-coming Islanders would be a perfect centerpiece for his new network. Dolan gave Pickett a long-term guaranteed contract intended not only to keep the team on Long Island, but give area governments an incentive to renew his cable contracts. The Islanders have remained on the network, now known as\nMSG Sportsnet\n, for over four decades.\nThe Dynasty (1979\u20131983)\n[\nedit\n]\nAfter the Islanders' regular season dominance and playoff disappointment in 1979, Arbour decided that he would no longer concern himself too greatly with his team's finish in the regular season. Instead, he focused his team's energy on how they would perform in the playoffs. In\n1980\n, the Islanders dropped below the 100-point mark for the first time in five years, earning only 91 points. However, they finally broke through and won the\nStanley Cup\n.\nBefore the\n1980\nplayoffs, the Islanders acquired\nButch Goring\nfrom the\nLos Angeles Kings\n. Goring's arrival was often called the \"final piece of the puzzle.\"\nBefore the playoffs, Torrey made the difficult decision to trade longtime and popular veterans Billy Harris and defenseman\nDave Lewis\nto the\nLos Angeles Kings\nfor second line center\nButch Goring\n. Goring's arrival is often called the \"final piece of the puzzle\",\n[\n32\n]\na strong two-way player, his presence on the second line ensured that opponents would no longer be able to focus their defensive efforts on the Islanders' first line of Bossy, Trottier and\nClark Gillies\n. Contributions from new teammates, such as wingers\nDuane Sutter\nand\nAnders Kallur\nand\nstay-at-home defensemen\nDave Langevin\n,\nGord Lane\n, and\nKen Morrow\n(the latter fresh off a gold medal win at the\n1980 Olympics\n), also figured prominently in the Islanders' playoff success.\nIn the playoffs, the Islanders defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3\u20131 in the preliminary round, then beat the Boston Bruins 4\u20131 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, the Islanders faced the\nBuffalo Sabres\n, who had finished second overall in the NHL standings. The Islanders won the first two games in Buffalo, including a 2\u20131 victory in game two on\nBob Nystrom\n's goal in double overtime. They went on to win the series in six games and reach the finals for the first time in franchise history, where they would face the NHL's regular season champions, the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, who had gone undefeated for 35 straight games (25\u20130\u201310) during the regular season. In game one in\nPhiladelphia\n, the Islanders won 4\u20133 on\nDenis Potvin\n's power-play goal in overtime. Leading the series 3\u20132, they went home to Long Island for game six. In that game the Islanders blew a 4\u20132 lead in the third period but Nystrom continued his overtime heroics, scoring at 7:11 of the extra frame, on assists by John Tonelli and Lorne Henning, to bring Long Island its first Stanley Cup championship. This was the most recent Stanley Cup-clinching game won in overtime by the home team until the Los Angeles Kings did it in 2014. It was also the Islanders' sixth overtime victory of the playoffs. Bryan Trottier won the\nConn Smythe Trophy\nas the most valuable player in the playoffs. Torrey's strategy of building through the draft turned out very well; nearly all of the major contributors on the 1980 champions were home-grown Islanders or had spent most of their NHL careers in the Islanders organization. The Islanders were the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup with Europeans (\nStefan Persson\nand Kallur) on its roster.\n[\n33\n]\nThe Islanders dominated the next two seasons. Bossy scored\n50 goals in 50 games\nin\n1981\nand the Islanders lost only three playoff games en route to defeating the\nMinnesota North Stars\nin five games to win the Stanley Cup. Goring won the Conn Smythe Trophy. During their semifinals sweep of the Rangers, Islander fans began taunting the Rangers with a chant of \"\n1940!\n\"\u00a0\u2013 referring to the Rangers' last Stanley Cup win in\n1940\n(the Rangers would not win the cup again until\n1994\n). Fans in other NHL cities soon picked up the chant.\n[\n34\n]\nThese four banners hung in\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nand represent the four\nStanley Cup\nchampionships the Islanders won from 1980 through 1983.\nIn\n1981\u201382\n, the Islanders won a then-record 15 straight games en route to a franchise-record 118 points, while\nMike Bossy\nset a scoring record for right-wingers with 147 points in an 80-game schedule. The Islanders finished with the most points in the league (118), yet once in the playoffs against the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nthey found themselves down late in the third period of deciding game 5 before\nJohn Tonelli\nscored both the tying goal and the overtime winner. After defeating the Rangers in six games they swept both the\nQuebec Nordiques\nand the\nVancouver Canucks\nin the first-ever coast-to-coast\nStanley Cup Finals\nfor their third straight championship. During that series Bossy, upended by a check from\nTiger Williams\nand falling parallel to the ice, managed to hook the puck with his stick and score. Bossy netted the Stanley Cup-winning goal and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nThe next year, although the Islanders had won the Stanley Cup three straight times, more attention was being paid to the upstart\nEdmonton Oilers\n, whose young superstar\nWayne Gretzky\nhad just shattered existing scoring records.\n[\n35\n]\nIn\n1982\u201383\nthe Oilers had a better regular season, but the Islanders swept them in the\nStanley Cup Finals\nto win their fourth straight championship.\nBilly Smith\nwas named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner after shutting down the Oilers' vaunted scoring machine. Gretzky failed to score a goal during the series.\n[\n36\n]\nDuane and\nBrent Sutter\nscored seven and five points respectively in the first three games, while Bossy again scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in game four. After that game, the Oilers players walked past the Islanders' dressing room and were surprised to see the champions exhausted. Oilers players such as Gretzky and\nMark Messier\nsaid that they realized at that moment how much it would actually take to win the Stanley Cup.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\nPost-dynasty and the Easter Epic (1983\u20131991)\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders finished the\n1983\u201384 regular season\ntied atop the Prince of Wales Conference while successfully defending their Patrick Division title. The \"Drive for Five\" got off to a tense start. Late in the deciding game of their first-round series against the Rangers,\nDon Maloney\ntied the game with a controversial goal as the Islanders believed Maloney's stick was too high. They ultimately eliminated the Rangers for the fourth consecutive year. The team then defeated the\nWashington Capitals\nin five games and the\nMontreal Canadiens\nin six to set up a finals rematch with the Oilers. The series featured rookie\nPat LaFontaine\nscoring two third-period goals in 38 seconds. This time, the Oilers dethroned the Islanders to win the first of what would be five Stanley Cup victories in seven years. For the\n1984 playoffs\n, the NHL changed the home and away schedule for the finals, which provided the Islanders home-ice advantage in the series based on Wales Conference teams collectively having a winning record in regular season games versus Campbell Conference opponents,\n[\n38\n]\ndespite finishing lower than them in the overall standings. The new format had them play three straight games in Edmonton, where the Oilers managed to lock up the series, after the teams had split the first two games in New York. Bossy cited the team's hard time winning an away game as their downfall in the series.\n[\n39\n]\nThe Oilers also ended the Islanders' 19-series playoff winning streak. It remains the longest streak in the history of professional sports (one more than the 1959\u20131967 streak by the\nBoston Celtics\nof the NBA). Unlike the 1976\u20131979 Montreal Canadiens, who needed to win three series in the 1976 and 1977 playoffs under the playoff format in place at that time, the Islanders had to win four series in each of their Stanley Cup seasons.\nThe Islanders remained competitive for the rest of the decade, even as some of the stars from the Cup teams departed. As the decade wore on, Pickett began to keep the money from the team's cable deal rather than reinvest it in the team as he had done in years past. Although it did not become clear immediately, the lack of funds limited Torrey's ability to replace all of the departing talent. In the\n1984\u201385 NHL season\n, the Islanders slipped to third in their division, followed by similar results in the\n1985\u201386\nand\n1986\u201387\nseasons. They began facing stiff competition from division rivals, the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, who eliminated the Islanders in the division finals in 1985 and 1987, and the Capitals, who swept the Islanders' 1986 first-round series, the team's first exit without winning a playoff round since 1978.\nKelly Hrudey\n(pictured in 2006) saved 73 of 75 shots in the \"\nEaster Epic\n\" for the Islanders, who came out victorious after four periods of overtime play.\nIn 1986, Nystrom retired due to a serious injury\n[\n40\n]\nand\nClark Gillies\nwas picked up on waivers by the\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\n[\n41\n]\nArbour retired as coach following the\n1985\u201386 season\nand was replaced by longtime junior hockey coach\nTerry Simpson\n.\n[\n42\n]\nDuring the first round of the\n1987 playoffs\nagainst the Capitals, the Islanders had fallen behind in the series three games to one but were not eliminated due to a playoff format change from a best-of-5 series to a best-of-7.\n[\n43\n]\nThe Islanders evened the series, which set the stage for one of the most famous games in NHL history: the \"\nEaster Epic\n\".\nKelly Hrudey\nstopped 73 shots on goal while Pat LaFontaine scored at 8:47 of the fourth overtime\u2014and at 1:56\u00a0a.m. on\nEaster Sunday\nmorning. The win came even though the Islanders had been outshot 75\u201352.\n[\n44\n]\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\nThey were eliminated in the division finals in seven games by the Flyers.\n[\n47\n]\nChronic back pain forced\nMike Bossy\nto retire after the season.\n[\n48\n]\nThe\nfollowing season\n, the Islanders captured another division title,\n[\n49\n]\nbut were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the upstart\nNew Jersey Devils\n.\n[\n50\n]\nPotvin retired after the playoffs, holding records for most career goals (310), assists (742) and points (1052) by a defenseman, though he has since been passed in these categories by\nRay Bourque\nand\nPaul Coffey\n. Around this time, the team's run of good luck in the draft began to run out. Of their four top draft picks from 1987 to 1990, they lost one to a freak knee injury and two others never panned out.\n[\n51\n]\nThe\n1988\u201389 season\nsaw the Islanders win only seven of their first 27 games. Torrey fired Simpson and brought Arbour back. Arbour was unable to turn things around, and the team finished with 61 points, tied with the\nQuebec Nordiques\nfor the worst record in the league. It was their first losing season and the first time missing the playoffs since their second season. Smith, the last remaining original Islanders player, retired after the season to become the team's goaltending coach. Not long after the end of the season, Pickett moved to Florida and turned day-to-day operations over to a committee of four Long Island entrepreneurs: Ralph Palleschi, Bob Rosenthal,\nStephen Walsh\n, and\nPaul Greenwood\n. In return, they each bought a 2.5% interest in the team.\n[\n51\n]\nIn the\nnext season\n, the Islanders rebounded to get back into the playoffs, but fell to the Rangers in five games of the opening round. The team bought out the remaining years of\nBryan Trottier\n's contract, sending him off with a team record of games played. The\n1990\u201391 season\nhad the team finish well out of the playoffs after winning only 25 games.\nNew faces and the 1993 run (1991\u20131995)\n[\nedit\n]\nLaFontaine was frustrated with the team's lack of success and the progress of his contract negotiations, and held out rather than report to camp before\n1991\u201392\n. In response to the holdout, Torrey engineered a rebuilding project with two blockbuster trades on October 25, 1991. He dealt LaFontaine,\nRandy Wood\nand\nRandy Hillier\n(along with future considerations) to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin return for\nPierre Turgeon\n,\nBenoit Hogue\n,\nUwe Krupp\nand\nDave McLlwain\n. He also sent longtime captain\nBrent Sutter\nand\nBrad Lauer\nto the\nChicago Blackhawks\nfor\nSteve Thomas\nand\nAdam Creighton\n. With these additions and a talented core of players such as\nDerek King\n,\nRay Ferraro\n, and\nPatrick Flatley\n, along with incoming\nSoviet\nplayers\nVladimir Malakhov\nand\nDarius Kasparaitis\n, the Islanders had a new foundation in the early 1990s. The management committee, however, was not nearly as patient as Boe and Pickett had been, and forced Torrey to resign after the Islanders missed the playoffs again that season. Assistant general manager\nDon Maloney\nwas hired in Torrey's place,\n[\n51\n]\nwhile Torrey quickly resurfaced with the expansion\nFlorida Panthers\n.\nIn Maloney's first year,\n1992\u201393\n, the Islanders rebounded to make the playoffs, in the process surpassing the 80-point mark for the first time in five years. The LaFontaine-Turgeon trade proved successful for both the Islanders and Sabres, as both players hit career highs in points and Turgeon won the\nLady Byng Trophy\n.\nRay Ferraro emerged as a playoff hero, scoring a pair of overtime winners in the first-round series against the Capitals. Instead of celebrating after winning game 6 at Nassau Coliseum, however, the Islanders were both irate and despondent. Only seconds after Turgeon, the team's star center and leading scorer, scored an insurance goal in the series-clinching game,\nDale Hunter\nviolently checked him from behind. Turgeon was believed to be out for the entire second round, if not longer, with a separated shoulder. He returned only for spot power-play duty in the last game of the second round. Hunter received a 21-game suspension, at the time the longest for on-ice misconduct in modern NHL history.\nThe Islanders' next opponent, the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, were twice-defending Stanley Cup champions and full of stars such as\nMario Lemieux\n,\nJaromir Jagr\n, and\nRon Francis\n. The Penguins had roared through the regular season with 119 points, as well as recording a record 17 consecutive wins towards the end of the season, and were overwhelmingly favored to win a third straight championship. Jim Smith of\nNewsday\npredicted that with Turgeon on the sidelines, the Penguins would sweep the Islanders out of the playoffs, however on the strength of outstanding goaltending from\nGlenn Healy\nand contributions from all four lines, the Islanders achieved a huge upset when\nDavid Volek\nscored at 5:16 of overtime of the deciding seventh game.\nNewsday'\ns front page the day following the win was a picture of Healy with a headline reading, \"It's a Miracle!\" This was the last playoff series won by the Islanders for 23 years, until the 2015\u201316 season. Turgeon returned to the Islanders' top line for the conference finals against the\nMontreal Canadiens\n, though he was not in peak form as he had not fully recovered. The Islanders bowed out of the playoffs after a hard-fought five games, two of which went to overtime. After beating the Islanders, the Canadiens went on to win the Cup.\nMaloney had avoided making many personnel changes his first year, but on the eve of the\n1993 expansion draft\nhe traded backup goaltender\nMark Fitzpatrick\nto the\nQuebec Nordiques\nfor\nRon Hextall\n. The clubs also exchanged first-round picks in the deal. Able to protect only one netminder in the expansion draft, the Islanders left Healy exposed. He was claimed by the\nMighty Ducks of Anaheim\n, then was claimed by the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nin Phase II of the draft the next day, and finally had his rights traded to the Rangers, where he became the backup.\nThe Islanders barely squeezed past the Panthers to make the 1994 playoffs before being swept in a lopsided opening series by the first-place Rangers, who went on to win the Cup. It would be the Islanders' last playoff appearance until\n2002\n. Arbour retired for good as coach and was succeeded by longtime assistant\nLorne Henning\n. Hextall, who allowed 16 goals in three games, drew most of the criticism for the failed playoff campaign and was shipped to Philadelphia for\nTommy Soderstrom\nin September. In the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season, the Islanders not only failed to qualify for the playoffs, they finished ahead of only the third-year\nOttawa Senators\n.\nManagement issues (1995\u20132000)\n[\nedit\n]\nBy the end of the 1994\u201395 season, Maloney was under considerable heat from the press and fan base for his handling of the team. Since taking over in 1992, the only noticeable attempt he made to upgrade the roster was the acquisition of Hextall. Near the end of the failed 1995 campaign, Maloney decided that the core of players he had left alone for three seasons needed to be revamped, leading to a rebuilding project. He traded Turgeon and Malakhov to the\nMontreal Canadiens\nfor\nKirk Muller\nand\nMathieu Schneider\n, while Hogue was sent to\nToronto\nfor young goaltender\nEric Fichaud\n. Additionally, Maloney allowed the team's leading scorer, Ferraro, to depart as an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of the season. Fans' displeasure at Maloney for trading the popular Turgeon was magnified when Muller balked at joining a rebuilding team. He played 45 games for the Islanders before being sent to Toronto as well.\nBefore the\n1995\u201396 season\n, Maloney fired Henning and named\nMike Milbury\nhead coach. The same year, the Islanders' attempt at updating their look resulted in the unveiling of a new team logo of a slicker-clad fisherman holding a hockey stick. Islanders fans disliked it, and rival Rangers' fans mockingly called the Islanders \"\nfishsticks\n\"\u2014mocking how the logo resembled the\nGorton's Fisherman\n. The team reverted to a modified version of the old logo as soon as the league allowed them to do so. (In spite of this, the logo found renewed popularity as a throwback design in the late 2010s and early 2020s, enough so that the team would revive it as their third \"Reverse Retro\" jersey in 2022 and would use an adjusted version of the logo for their AHL team, the\nBridgeport Islanders\n, beginning in 2024.) The year was a disappointment on the ice as well, as the Islanders finished in last place with a record of 22\u201350\u201310. During the season, team management fired Maloney, whom fans blamed for the team's downfall,\n[\n52\n]\nand gave Milbury full control of hockey operations as both a coach and general manager. Milbury went on to resign as head coach during the\nfollowing season\nand elevated assistant\nRick Bowness\nto the position. After another unsuccessful season with little improvement, Milbury took over as coach again during the\n1997\u201398 season\n. The team improved to fourth place in their division but again failed to make the playoffs. Milbury followed by once again stepping down as coach during the\nfollowing season\nwhile retaining his job as general manager.\nDuring the continued playoff drought, instability in the front office mirrored the Islanders' substandard performance on the ice. Pickett sold the team to\nDallas\nbusinessman\nJohn Spano\nin 1996. However, three months after the 1997 closing, Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of the first installment on the cable rights deal. Several Islanders executives tipped off\nNewsday\nthat something was amiss about their new boss.\n[\n53\n]\nIn July,\nNewsday\nexposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required to complete the deal. The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth, and also had two lawsuits pending against him. Within days of the report, Spano was forced to relinquish the team to Pickett. Federal prosecutors turned up evidence that Spano had forged many of the documents used to vouch for his wealth and to promise payment to Pickett, and even appeared to have sent many of the documents from his own office in Dallas. He was sentenced to 71 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. The NHL took additional heat when reports surfaced that the league spent well under $1,000 (depending on the source, the league spent either $525\n[\n53\n]\nor $750\n[\n51\n]\n) to check Spano's background. It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners. The incident and its aftermath were covered in the\nESPN\n30 for 30\ndocumentary,\nBig Shot\n.\n[\n54\n]\nPickett finally found a buyer, a group led by\nHoward Milstein\nand\nPhoenix Coyotes\nco-owner Steven Gluckstern, a deal which almost fell through when\nSpectacor Management Group\n, which managed the Coliseum for Nassau County, tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was safe. Pickett refused, since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in recent seasons. SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders, the NHL, and Nassau County officials.\nInitially, the team made numerous trades and increased their payroll in an effort to assemble a better team. In one transaction, young players\nTodd Bertuzzi\nand\nBryan McCabe\nwere traded for veteran\nTrevor Linden\n. After the Islanders finished 12 points short of the playoffs in the 1997\u201398 season, however, Milstein and Gluckstern decided to run the team on an austere budget in an attempt to make a profit. They also complained about the condition of the Nassau Coliseum and made noises about moving the team elsewhere. They began trading or releasing many popular players to avoid paying their salaries, including star scorer\nZigmund Palffy\n, team captain Linden, former rookie of the year\nBryan Berard\n, and rugged defenseman\nRich Pilon\n. Losing the highly regarded players, the team finished with similar results the next two seasons. Attendance, which had been in a steady decline over the past few years, decreased even further to under 12,000 per game. Around that time, Milstein bid hundreds of millions of dollars in unsuccessful attempts to purchase the\nNational Football League\n's\nWashington Redskins\nand\nCleveland Browns\n.\nNew ownership and a return to the playoffs (2000\u20132006)\n[\nedit\n]\nLet's face it, the Coliseum is a dump, and the team, well, they're losers. It's a real shame. We want to see it change because this is our home. We all deserve better.\n\u2014\nCharles Wang\n[\n55\n]\nIn 2000, Milstein and Gluckstern sold the team to\nComputer Associates\nexecutives\nCharles Wang\nand\nSanjay Kumar\n. The sale cost $187.5\u00a0million ($342.36\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) and gave fans hope for the team to turn its lack of success around.\n[\n55\n]\nThe new owners allowed Milbury to spend money and invest in free agents. His first attempt proved unpopular with fans, as he traded away future star players\nRoberto Luongo\nand\nOlli Jokinen\nto the\nFlorida Panthers\nfor\nOleg Kvasha\nand\nMark Parrish\n. Milbury then further surprised the hockey world when he took\nRick DiPietro\nwith the first selection in the\n2000 draft\n, ahead of consensus picks\nDany Heatley\nand\nMarian Gaborik\n. Reporters and fans were alternately confused and enraged by the moves, which Milbury acknowledged, saying, \"As dangerous as this may be, we think Mad Mike maybe has something going for him.\"\n[\n56\n]\nEstablishing a record of controversial decisions, Milbury held onto the \"Mad Mike\" nickname for years to follow. He remained adamant that his moves were to immediately improve the team, whose poor winning percentage that year was ahead of only the franchise's first season.\n[\n57\n]\nThe team's uninspired play led Milbury to fire head coach and past player\nButch Goring\n. Fans vocalized their dislike of Goring taking the fall rather than Milbury, which was further worsened when Milbury passed on hiring\nTed Nolan\nas Goring's successor; Instead,\nBoston Bruins\nassistant coach\nPeter Laviolette\nwas hired.\n[\n58\n]\nThe Islanders acquired\nAlexei Yashin\n(left) prior to the\n2001\u201302 season\n. Yashin would go on to become the team's captain in later years.\nThree key personnel acquisitions were made prior to the 2001\u201302 season, Laviolette's first.\nAlexei Yashin\nwas acquired from the\nOttawa Senators\nin exchange for forward\nBill Muckalt\n, defenseman\nZdeno Chara\nand the Islanders' second overall pick in the\n2001 draft\n. Next, Islanders prospects\nTim Connolly\nand\nTaylor Pyatt\nwere traded to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin exchange for\nMichael Peca\n, who became the team's captain.\n[\n59\n]\n[\n60\n]\nBy virtue of finishing with the worst record in the previous season,\nDetroit Red Wings\ngoaltender\nChris Osgood\nwas the next addition, taken as the first pick in the September 2001 waiver draft, adding a former Stanley Cup championship goaltender without giving up any players in exchange.\n[\n61\n]\nThe additions proved to be a great help, as the team opened the season with a 9\u20130\u20131\u20131 record, the best in franchise history. They finished the season with new broken records; their 96 points marked the fourth biggest one-year turnaround in the league's history (44 points higher than the previous season), while Osgood's 66 starts surpassed\nRon Hextall\n's previous record of 65.\n[\n22\n]\nDuring the\n2002 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, they were seeded fifth and faced the fourth-seeded\nToronto Maple Leafs\n. The Islanders lost in a very physical first-round series in seven games; the home team won every game of the series. Notably, game 5 featured\nGary Roberts\ncharging Islander defenseman\nKenny Jonsson\n, and\nDarcy Tucker\nsubmarining Peca with a questionable check that tore the Islander captain's\nanterior cruciate ligament\n, sidelining both players for the series' final game. The situation between Tucker and Peca caused a bit of outrage, with speculation that Tucker had intended to injure Peca before the game had begun, which Tucker denied.\n[\n62\n]\nDespite the promise shown in the Toronto playoff series, the Islanders had a slow start to the\n2002\u201303 season\n. They rebounded to make the playoffs, but lost a five-game series in the first round to the top-seeded\nOttawa Senators\n.\n[\n63\n]\nMilbury continued his controversial move-making by firing Laviolette after the season, citing postseason interviews with the players in which they expressed a lack of confidence in the coach.\n[\n64\n]\nHe was replaced with\nSteve Stirling\n, who had previously been coaching the team's top minor league affiliate, the\nBridgeport Sound Tigers\n. In the\nfollowing season\n, the Islanders again lost in the first round of the playoffs, this time to the eventual champion\nTampa Bay Lightning\n.\n[\n65\n]\nFollowing the\n2004\u201305 NHL lockout\n, which eliminated that season of play, the Islanders made several player moves to increase offense for\nfollowing season\n. Peca was traded to the\nEdmonton Oilers\nfor center\nMike York\n, freeing up room under the NHL's new salary cap.\n[\n66\n]\nThe same day, the team signed winger\nMiroslav Satan\nto play alongside Yashin.\n[\n67\n]\nMilbury also worked on remaking the team's defense, adding\nAlexei Zhitnik\n,\nBrad Lukowich\nand\nBrent Sopel\nto replace the departed\nAdrian Aucoin\nand\nRoman Hamrlik\n, who left as free agents, and Jonsson, who left the NHL to play in the\nHockeyAllsvenskan\nin Sweden.\n[\n68\n]\nIn the aftermath, Yashin was named as the team's new captain.\n[\n69\n]\nThe team's inconsistent play led to Stirling's dismissal midway through the season.\n[\n14\n]\nManagement shake-ups and the DiPietro contract (2006\u20132009)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn the day of Stirling's firing, January 11, 2006, Milbury also announced that he would step down as general manager once a successor was found.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n70\n]\nHe served as vice president of Wang's sports properties for one year before resigning in May 2007.\n[\n71\n]\nWang proceeded by hiring\nNeil Smith\nas general manager and\nTed Nolan\nas head coach, following a brief stint by\nBrad Shaw\nas the team's interim head coach.\n[\n72\n]\n[\n73\n]\nSmith, however, was fired after approximately one month and quickly replaced by the team's backup goaltender\nGarth Snow\n, who retired from his playing career to accept the position.\n[\n22\n]\nBefore his dismissal, Smith made several free agent acquisitions, including defensemen\nBrendan Witt\nand\nTom Poti\n, and forwards\nMike Sillinger\nand\nChris Simon\n.\n[\n72\n]\nOn September 12, 2006, the Islanders signed DiPietro to a 15-year, $67.5\u00a0million ($105.28\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) contract, which was believed to be the longest contract to date in the NHL and the second-longest in North American sports, behind a 25-year contract for\nNational Basketball Association\nplayer\nMagic Johnson\n.\n[\n74\n]\n[\n75\n]\nDiPietro, Wang and Snow all spoke confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides, despite the mixed reactions it received from the rest of the hockey world. Specifically, Wang stated, \"This is not a big deal. You have to have a commitment to who you're working with.\"\n[\n74\n]\nAs speculation began as to whether other teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players,\nAtlanta Thrashers\n' general manager\nDon Waddell\nfelt that, \"It's highly unlikely that you will see teams go beyond that. This is a once-in-a-lifetime contract. Ownership must feel very strongly that he's their guy for the next 15 years.\"\n[\n75\n]\nBill Guerin\nwas the team captain from 2007 to 2009.\nThe new-look Islanders were picked by most analysts to languish towards the bottom of the standings.\n[\n76\n]\nEyeing a playoff spot, Snow traded for forward\nRyan Smyth\nfrom the\nEdmonton Oilers\nat the trade deadline on February 27, 2007.\n[\n77\n]\nInjuries to DiPietro provided extra setbacks, but not enough to drop the team from playoff contention.\n[\n78\n]\n[\n79\n]\nThey qualified for the playoffs, assisted by a late-season winning streak and a 3\u20132 shootout victory against the\nNew Jersey Devils\nin their final regular season game.\n[\n80\n]\nDespite DiPietro's return to the team in time for the playoffs, the team lost their first round matchup in five games to the\nPresidents' Trophy\n-winning\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\n[\n81\n]\nManagement announced in June 2007 that they would buy out captain\nAlexei Yashin\n's contract, which had four seasons remaining on it.\n[\n82\n]\nFree agents Smyth, Poti,\nViktor Kozlov\n,\nJason Blake\n, and\nRichard Zednik\nalso left in July 2007.\n[\n83\n]\n[\n84\n]\nDuring that month, the Islanders signed\nBill Guerin\nto a two-year contract as he immediately assumed team captaincy.\n[\n83\n]\nAlso in the off-season, free agents\nMike Comrie\n,\nAndy Sutton\nand\nJon Sim\njoined the team.\n[\n85\n]\n[\n86\n]\nThat summer, it was announced that Nolan extended an invitation to Al Arbour to return as a coach for one game in order to bring his total number of games coached to 1,500.\n[\n87\n]\n[\n88\n]\nArbour signed a one-day contract, the shortest in league history, on November 3, 2007; it put him behind the bench the following day as the Islanders defeated the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n3\u20132, raising his career coaching win total to 740.\n[\n89\n]\nThe team remained in the playoff hunt through the trade deadline as they re-signed Comrie to a one-year contract and traded away Simon and\nMarc-Andre Bergeron\n.\n[\n90\n]\nA rash of injuries saw them plummet to the fifth-worst record in the league by the end of the season.\n[\n91\n]\nJosh Bailey\nwas drafted by the Islanders in 2008, to provide depth at the wing for the team.\nAt the\n2008 NHL entry draft\n, the Islanders made two trades to move down from the fifth to the ninth overall pick, with which they selected center\nJosh Bailey\n. They also added free agents\nMark Streit\nand\nDoug Weight\n. The team dismissed head coach\nTed Nolan\nover alleged philosophy differences,\n[\n92\n]\n[\n93\n]\nand later that summer replaced him with\nScott Gordon\n.\n[\n94\n]\nNear the trade deadline, Snow traded Comrie and\nChris Campoli\nto the\nOttawa Senators\nin exchange for forward\nDean McAmmond\nand the\nSan Jose Sharks\n' first-round draft pick in the\n2009 NHL entry draft\nand sent captain Bill Guerin to the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin exchange for a conditional draft pick.\n[\n95\n]\n[\n96\n]\nIn the\n2008\u201309 season\n, the Islanders finished in last place in the league with a record of 26\u201347\u20139, which was the team's worst record since the 2000\u201301 season. After the conclusion of regular season, they won the draft lottery to retain the first overall pick in the\n2009 NHL entry draft\n.\n[\n97\n]\nThe Tavares era begins (2009\u20132015)\n[\nedit\n]\nBeginning an effort to rebuild the team with new and young talent, the Islanders selected\nJohn Tavares\nwith the first-overall pick of the\n2009 NHL entry draft\n.\n[\n98\n]\nTavares went into the draft as the top prospect in the majority of scouting reports,\n[\n99\n]\nand it was widely expected that the Islanders would select him after they secured the first overall pick by winning the draft lottery, although there was plenty of competition between Tavares,\nVictor Hedman\n, and\nMatt Duchene\n.\n[\n100\n]\nNHL Central Scouting Bureau\n's Chris Edwards spoke highly of him, stating, \"[Tavares] is phenomenal at getting the puck through traffic to his linemates, getting to opening. The way he reads the play and can get to where he figures the rebounds will be and bangs in the rebound. He's a real smart player.\"\n[\n101\n]\nThey traded up twice in the first round to also select defenseman\nCalvin de Haan\nwith the 12th overall pick,\n[\n102\n]\nas well as\nCasey Cizikas\nand\nAnders Lee\nin later rounds, all of whom would go on to play consistently on the main roster by the\n2014\u201315 season\n.\n[\n103\n]\nThe\n2009\u201310 season\nstarted out slow, with the team winless its first six games.\n[\n104\n]\nThe team continued to play inconsistently due to injuries as many wrote them off as potential playoff contenders.\n[\n105\n]\nThe team hit a mid-season hot streak,\n[\n106\n]\nhowever nine losses in 11 games before the Olympic break set them right back.\n[\n107\n]\nThey ultimately ended up at bottom of the standings again, finishing the season 26th in the league.\n[\n108\n]\nThe placement led to a fifth overall pick in\n2010\n. Continuing with their rebuilding process, they used the first round to draft young forwards\nNino Niederreiter\nand\nBrock Nelson\nwith picks five and 30, respectively.\n[\n109\n]\nAs the\n2010\u201311 season\ngot underway, the team quickly fell into a ten-game losing streak, leading to the firing of head coach\nScott Gordon\n.\n[\n110\n]\n[\n111\n]\nHe was replaced on an interim basis by\nJack Capuano\n, who had been coaching the Bridgeport Sound Tigers.\n[\n111\n]\n[\n112\n]\nEarly in the season, they also acquired\nMichael Grabner\nfrom waivers, who went on to score 34 goals and was selected as a finalist for the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n;\n[\n113\n]\n[\n114\n]\nhe would go on to sign a five-year contract with the team at the end of the season.\n[\n114\n]\nThis year also featured the\nPenguins\u2013Islanders brawl\n, which resulted in a combined 346 penalty minutes and a $100,000 fine to the Islanders for \"failure to control their players\".\nJohn Tavares\n, was named an alternate captain for the\n2011\u201312 season\n. He was later named the team captain in 2013.\nThe\nfollowing season\nwas a breakout year for Tavares. The newly named assistant captain gained 31 goals and 50 assists,\n[\n115\n]\nin addition to being selected to play in the\n59th NHL All-Star Game\nat the age of 21;\n[\n116\n]\nhis 81 points were seventh-best in the league.\n[\n117\n]\nTavares' left-winger\nMatt Moulson\nalso had a strong season, finishing with career highs of 36 goals, 33 assists and 69 points.\n[\n118\n]\nDespite strong seasons from their top players, the team finished 27th in the league with a record of 34\u201337\u201311, continuing their pattern of racking up top prospects with early picks at the drafts.\n[\n119\n]\nThey used the first round of the\n2012 draft\nto select defenseman\nGriffin Reinhart\nwith the fourth overall pick.\n[\n120\n]\nOn August 1, 2011, voters in\nNassau County\nrejected a proposal for a new arena to replace Nassau Coliseum. This followed the failed decade-long attempt by owner Charles Wang to build a mixed-use development called\nThe Lighthouse Project\n, which would have renovated the arena.\n[\n121\n]\nIn the wake of the vote, speculation began that the team would eventually move to\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\n, new arenas in\nQueens\nor\nSuffolk County\n, the\nSprint Center\nin\nKansas City\n, or the\nVideotron Centre\nin\nQuebec City\n, the last of which was coincidentally set to open at the same time as the expiration of the Islanders' lease on the Nassau Coliseum in 2015.\n[\n122\n]\n[\n123\n]\n[\n124\n]\nOn October 24, 2012, the Islanders made the announcement that the franchise would indeed be moving to the\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\nfor the 2015\u201316 NHL season, after signing a lease that would keep the team in the arena until 2040. The team retained its name, logo and colors as part of the move.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n125\n]\nAs part of the deal, the management of Barclays Center took over the team's business operations once the Islanders moved to Barclays Center.\n[\n126\n]\nThe decision to move to Brooklyn didn't require the Rangers' approval. Under a longstanding provision of the agreement that allowed the Islanders to share the New York area with the Rangers, the Islanders are allowed to play their games anywhere on Long Island, including the two city boroughs on the island, Brooklyn and\nQueens\n.\n[\n127\n]\nBeginning on April 1, 2013, of the\n2012\u201313 season\n, the team went on a near month-long unbeaten streak in regulation time, posting a 12-game streak of earning points until falling to the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nlater that month.\n[\n128\n]\nDuring that streak, on April 23, 2013, they clinched their first playoff berth since 2007 with a 4\u20133 shootout loss to the\nCarolina Hurricanes\n, ending a six-year playoff drought.\n[\n128\n]\n[\n129\n]\nBehind goaltender\nEvgeni Nabokov\n, the team was ultimately eliminated in six games by the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin the first round of the\nplayoffs\n, continuing their winless streak in playoff series.\n[\n130\n]\n[\n131\n]\nOn September 10, 2013, Tavares was introduced as the 14th captain in New York Islanders history, replacing former Islander Mark Streit of the Philadelphia Flyers, who served as team captain since 2011.\n[\n132\n]\nAfter posting a 4\u20134\u20133 record in their first 11 games, the Islanders made a trade, sending fan favorite and three-time 30-goal scorer Matt Moulson, their 2014 first-round draft pick and their 2015 second-round draft pick to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin exchange for\nThomas Vanek\n, a highly regarded and dynamic goal scorer.\n[\n133\n]\n[\n134\n]\nDespite chemistry with linemates Tavares and\nKyle Okposo\n, however, his desire to test free agency and the team's impending move to\nBarclays Center\n[\n135\n]\nled to Vanek being dealt to the\nMontreal Canadiens\nat the trade deadline for\nSebastian Collberg\nand a second-round pick in\n2014\n.\n[\n136\n]\n[\n137\n]\nAfter a season of player swapping and goaltending issues, they failed to qualify for the\nplayoffs\n, finishing with a record of 34\u201337\u201311.\n[\n138\n]\nThe Islanders acquired\nNick Leddy\nthrough a trade with the\nChicago Blackhawks\nduring the 2014 off-season.\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Islanders made several moves to improve the team before their\nfinal season\nat Nassau Coliseum. In May, the Islanders acquired the rights to\nJaroslav Halak\nfrom the\nWashington Capitals\nin exchange for a fourth-round pick in 2014. Halak was then signed to a four-year contract. The Islanders also signed\nMikhail Grabovski\n,\nNikolai Kulemin\nand goaltender\nChad Johnson\nas free agents. Additionally, on October 4, the Islanders acquired\nJohnny Boychuk\nfrom the\nBoston Bruins\nfor two-second round picks in 2014 and\n2015\nand a conditional third-round pick in 2015, as well as\nNick Leddy\nfrom the\nChicago Blackhawks\nin exchange for prospect\nVille Pokka\n,\nT. J. Brennan\nand the rights to\nAnders Nilsson\n.\nThe NHL Board of Governors approved the Islanders' sale to businessmen\nJon Ledecky\nand\nScott D. Malkin\nin October 2014. Ledecky and Malkin served as minority partners during a two-year transition period. At the end of the 2015\u201316 season, they formally took majority control from Wang, who retained a share of the franchise.\n[\n139\n]\nThe Islanders finished the 2014\u201315 regular season with a record of 47\u201328\u20137 for 101 points, and met the Washington Capitals in the first round of the\n2015 playoffs\n. The Capitals held home-ice advantage in the series after the Islanders lost their final regular season game to the\nColumbus Blue Jackets\n, 5\u20134, in a shootout, as the Islanders lost the season series to the Capitals after posting a 2\u20131\u20131 record in the season series (Washington went 2\u20130\u20132, winning the season series with six points to the Islanders' five). On April 19, 2015, in the third game of their first-round series against Washington, John Tavares scored 15 seconds into overtime to win the game for the Islanders, 2\u20131. It was the second-shortest overtime playoff game in Islanders history, and was the first overtime, game-winning goal for the Islanders in the playoffs since 1993. The Islanders lost the fourth and fifth games of their series before rebounding in the sixth game to force a seventh game in the series. However, they were denied entry into the second round by a single goal and would ultimately fall to the Capitals in seven games. As a result, game 6 was the Islanders' last game at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum; the Isles'\nCal Clutterbuck\nscored the final NHL goal in the building's first run prior to the Islanders' return in 2018.\nMove to Barclays Center and playoff series win (2015\u20132017)\n[\nedit\n]\nIn June 2015, the Islanders entered the\n2015 draft\nwithout a first-round pick, but emerged with two first-rounders in\nMathew Barzal\nand\nAnthony Beauvillier\nafter a series of draft day trades.\n[\n140\n]\nThe Islanders also selected forward\nAndong Song\nin the sixth round of the 2015 draft, making him the first Chinese player to be drafted by an NHL team.\n[\n141\n]\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\n. The Islanders played their home games there from 2015 to 2020.\nThe Islanders played their first regular season game at\nBarclays Center\non October 9, 2015, losing 3\u20132 in overtime to the\nChicago Blackhawks\n.\nArtem Anisimov\nscored the first regular season goal, while Tavares scored the first regular season Islanders goal. The Islanders posted the fourth-best penalty kill rate and allowed the fewest power-play goals during the season. However, in the last quarter of the regular season, some players, including Halak and defenseman\nTravis Hamonic\n, suffered key injuries. The team finished the regular season fourth in the Metropolitan Division with 100 points, enough to clinch the first wild card spot in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced off against the\nFlorida Panthers\n; goaltender\nThomas Greiss\nonly played in 40 minutes of playoff hockey with the\nSan Jose Sharks\nprior to this series. Both teams split the first four games of the series. The fifth game of the series proved to be a major turning point, as late season call-up\nAlan Quine\nscored the game-winning goal on the power play with four minutes left in double overtime to end the second-longest game in franchise history; that goal gave them a 3\u20132 series lead and a chance to clinch the series on home ice. In the sixth game, the Islanders trailed 1\u20130 for much of the game, but Tavares tied it late in the third period. Tavares would score again with the series-clinching goal in double overtime to give the Islanders their first playoff series win since 1993. In the second round of the playoffs, they faced the Tampa Bay Lightning for the first time since 2004. Despite winning the first game of the series, the Islanders lost their series to the Lightning in five games.\nAndrew Ladd\nprior to a game during the\n2016\u201317 season\n. Ladd signed with the Islanders as a free agent during the 2016 off-season.\nSummer of 2016 saw free agents and longtime Islanders Kyle Okposo, Frans Nielsen, and Matt Martin all depart the team, joining the\nBuffalo Sabres\n,\nDetroit Red Wings\n, and\nToronto Maple Leafs\n, respectively. Snow signed free agents\nAndrew Ladd\nfrom the\nChicago Blackhawks\nand\nJason Chimera\nfrom the\nWashington Capitals\nto help fill the gaps left behind.\n[\n142\n]\nAfter an underwhelming first half of the\n2016\u201317 season\n, posting a 17\u201317\u20138 record through 42 games, head coach Jack Capuano was relieved of duties, with assistant general manager\nDoug Weight\nbeing named interim head coach.\n[\n143\n]\nHaving coached the team since 2010, Capuano was the second-winningest coach in the team's history with 227 wins, also leading the team to their first playoff series win since 1993.\n[\n144\n]\nPrior to Capuano's release, goaltender Jaroslav Halak was placed on waivers, and eventually sent down to the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. Having carried three goaltenders for the second consecutive season, the decision was made to stick with the tandem of Greiss and back-up\nJean-Francois Berube\nafter Halak posted a 6\u20138\u20135 record with a .904 save percentage through the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season.\n[\n145\n]\nIn late January 2017, following a report by\nBloomberg News\nwhich speculated that Barclays Center was considering removing the Islanders due to poor attendance and effects on the venue's profit margins (reception to Barclays Center as a hockey venue was mixed partly due to obstructed view seats,\n[\n146\n]\nas well as features like an off-center scoreboard, and the Islanders had the third-worst average attendance in the entire league while playing at the venue),\nNewsday\nreported that Nassau County executive Edward Mangano had met with one of the team's co-owners, and told the paper that it was possible that the Islanders could return to the renovated Nassau Coliseum.\n[\n147\n]\n[\n148\n]\nHowever, commissioner\nGary Bettman\nconsidered the concept to be \"unviable\" (the renovation reduced the capacity of the arena to just under 14,000, which is smaller than any NHL arena), and noted that Ledecky and Malkin were pursuing a possible arena project at\nBelmont Park\n.\n[\n149\n]\nDespite winning their last six games of the 2016\u201317 season, the Islanders finished in ninth place in the Eastern Conference; they missed the playoffs by only one point when the Toronto Maple Leafs clinched the final playoff spot on the penultimate day of the season.\nEmergence of Barzal and management overhaul (2017\u2013present)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn February 9, 2018, rookie\nMathew Barzal\nrecorded his third five-point game, becoming only the second rookie to do so since\nJoe Malone\nin 1917\u201318 and tying a 100-year-old record in the process.\n[\n150\n]\nAt the end of the 2017\u201318 regular season, Barzal had 85 points (22 goals, 63 assists). He led his team and all NHL rookies in points, and was tied for 13th overall in scoring in the NHL. Barzal was the seventh rookie in NHL history, and first since\nSidney Crosby\nin 2005\u201306, to have scored at least 20 goals and 60 assists in a single season.\n[\n151\n]\nBarzal also tied Islanders legend,\nBryan Trottier\n's franchise record for rookie assists.\n[\n152\n]\nBarzal won the Calder Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year for his 85-point season, leading the closest candidate by 20 points and receiving 160 out of 164 first-place votes. Barzal was the first Islanders' player to win the award since\nBryan Berard\nin 1997, and he was the fifth Islanders' player overall to win the trophy, joining Islanders legends\nMike Bossy\n(1978), Trottier (1976), and\nDenis Potvin\n(1974).\n[\n151\n]\nIslanders players after a win against the\nColorado Avalanche\non January 6, 2020\nDuring the 2018 off-season, the Islanders announced that former\nNew Jersey Devils\nand\nToronto Maple Leafs\ngeneral manager\nLou Lamoriello\nwas named their president of hockey operations, with \"full authority over all hockey matters with the organization\", and would become general manager on June 5, 2018, replacing\nGarth Snow\n.\n[\n153\n]\n[\n154\n]\nAdditionally,\nBarry Trotz\nwas hired as head coach of the Islanders.

The use of both arenas would continue over the course of the following two seasons until the completion of a new 18,000-seat arena at\nBelmont Park\nin\nElmont\n.\n[\n157\n]\n[\n158\n]\n[\n159\n]\nThe Islanders enjoyed success throughout the 2018\u201319 season, clinching a playoff berth at home for the first time in 17 years, and the first time in March since 1990.\n[\n160\n]\n[\n161\n]\n[\n162\n]\nNassau Coliseum hosted their home playoff games during the first round while the Barclays Center hosted their home games for the rest of the playoffs.\n[\n159\n]\n[\n163\n]\nIn the first round of the\n2019 playoffs\n, the Islanders swept the Pittsburgh Penguins, and in the second round the team was swept by the\nCarolina Hurricanes\n.\n[\n164\n]\nSince November 2021, the Islanders have played their home games at UBS Arena in\nElmont, New York\n.\nOn August 8, 2019, the\nEmpire State Development Corporation\nboard (ESD) voted unanimously in favor of the Belmont Park Arena project.\n[\n165\n]\nIn February 2020, it was announced that the Islanders would return to Nassau Coliseum for the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs and the 2020\u201321 season until\nUBS Arena\nwas opened.\n[\n166\n]\n[\n167\n]\nBoth the 2019\u201320 season and the construction of the new arena were interrupted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n. When the NHL season was suspended on March 12, 2020, the Islanders had twelve regular season games remaining and were one point shy of the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\n[\n168\n]\nThe Islanders qualified for the NHL Return-to-Play initiative as the seventh seed, beating the\nFlorida Panthers\nin four games in a best-of-5 qualifying round to make the\n2020 Stanley Cup playoffs\n. They would then go on to defeat the\nWashington Capitals\nin the first round in five games. Then, after blowing a 3\u20131 series lead to the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nthat extended the series to seven games, the Islanders would go on to win game 7 against the Flyers and advance to the conference finals for the first time since the\n1993 playoffs\n. However, their run would come to an end at the hands of the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nin six games. In December 2020, New York Islanders Hockey Club, L.P. bought the remaining 15 percent stake of the team from the\nestate of Charles Wang\nand took full ownership of the team.\n[\n169\n]\n[\n170\n]\n[\n171\n]\nThe Islanders again made the playoffs in the shortened 2020\u201321 season, defeating the Penguins and Bruins each in six games.

The lower part of the Y is made to resemble a hockey stick, with three orange stripes near the bottom of the shaft and a puck to the right of the stick blade. At the bottom of the logo, the name of the team is written so that the tip of the \"I\" ends in a point aimed at\nUniondale\n, the location of Nassau Coliseum.\nBefore the\n1995\u201396 season\n, the Islanders attempted to update their look by introducing a new logo depicting a fisherman holding a hockey stick. The new logo was a marketing disaster; the reaction among the fanbase was so negative that management announced it would revert to the original logo as soon as league rules allowed them to do so. Many found that the logo bore a strong resemblance to the\nGorton's fisherman\n; indeed,\nNew York Rangers\nfans taunted the Islanders with chants of \"We want\nfishsticks\n!\" long after the logo was discarded.\n[\n184\n]\nThe traditional logo was phased back in over the next two seasons, starting as an\nalternate jersey\nlogo in\n1996\u201397\nbefore fully replacing the fisherman in\n1997\u201398\n. The only change to the classic logo at this time was its colors; as the team had replaced its original royal blue with navy, the logo was recolored to match.\nThe short-lived \"Fisherman\" logo, used from 1995 to 1997\nBeginning in\n2008\u201309\n, the Islanders introduced another modification to their original logo for their new third jersey. The \"new\" logo, once again in royal blue, now features four orange stripes on the hockey stick instead of three, representing the four consecutive Stanley Cup titles won by the team in the 1980s. This became the team's full-time logo in 2010.\nFor their\n2014 Stadium Series\nspecial jerseys, the Islanders used a simplified jersey logo with just the \"NY\" from their regular logo. Versions of that have since appeared on third jersey designs.\nJerseys\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders debuted in 1972 with traditional-style jerseys: one was white with orange and royal blue stripes near the waistline and on the sleeves, the other was royal blue with white and orange stripes. The design remained largely the same, with only minor tweaks through the\n1994\u201395 season\n.\nPrior to the\n1995\u201396 season\n, team executives decided to change the jersey. The fisherman logo replaced the \"NY\" circular design, incorporating navy blue and a brighter orange, and introducing teal and gray shades. The team was seeking increased merchandise revenues, with the outward justification of connecting the team more overtly to Long Island. The jersey included a lighthouse shoulder patch, a reference to the\nMontauk Lighthouse\n, and featured uneven stripes resembling an ocean wave near the waistline, on the sleeves, and across the shoulders. All of the numbering and lettering on the jerseys also followed the wave pattern.\n[\n185\n]\nLate in the season, the team eliminated the fisherman logo, but league rules forbade them from switching jersey designs for the\n1996\u201397 season\non only a few months' notice. Instead, they debuted their first\nthird (and fourth) jerseys\n, which were identical to the home and road jerseys worn by the team, except the circular \"NY\" crest, now colored in the navy blue and bright orange shades to match, replaced the fisherman logo. The team wore these jerseys in approximately 15 games during that season and adopted them permanently in the\n1997\u201398 season\n.\nThe shoulder logo used on Islanders jerseys from 1998 through 2010\nPrior to the\n1998\u201399 season\n, the team's jerseys reverted to a traditional design but kept the navy blue and bright orange shades from the jerseys used the previous three seasons. They added a shoulder patch of four bars, alternating in color, to represent the Islanders' four Stanley Cup championships. A predominantly orange third jersey was introduced in\n2002\u201303\n, featuring navy blue yokes and sides that formed sharp points on the sleeves and body. The team wore this jersey through the\n2006\u201307 season\n.\nFor the\n2007\u201308 season\n, the Islanders redesigned their uniforms as all NHL teams changed over to the\nReebok Edge\nsystem. These jerseys resembled the prior design but included uniform numbers on the right chest above the logo. The name plates were also in two colored format: white on orange on the navy blue home jersey and navy blue on orange on the white road jersey. The sleeves on both jerseys were orange, with a wide navy stripe above a thin white stripe at the elbow. The jerseys had a thin stripe tracing around the shoulders, and featured \"retro\" laces at the neck.\nA royal blue throwback design was introduced the following season as a third jersey. Before the\n2010\u201311 season\n, the Islanders made this throwback design their new home jersey. A corresponding new white road jersey was unveiled during the Islanders'\ndraft\nparty at Nassau Coliseum.\n[\n186\n]\nFor the following season, they unveiled an alternate jersey in black with grey on the shoulder yoke. The front of the jersey bore the team name above the player's number in orange with blue and white trim. The Islanders crest was placed on the shoulder yoke. Diagonal side panels, blue trimmed in orange and gray, combined with similar panels on the black pants to form a diamond shape on the sides of each player. These were only used sparing for two seasons, as they proved unpopular.\nDuring the\n2014 Stadium Series\n, the Islanders wore a special edition jersey. The front side featured the \"NY\" from the primary logo in a special chrome treatment, while the back side featured a white nameplate with blue letters for player names, and bigger numbers in white trimmed in orange for visibility purposes. The sleeve numbers were also angled diagonally. The primary Islanders logo would be placed on the left shoulder within the white yoke. This jersey was promoted to an alternate third jersey in the\n2014\u201315 season\n, replacing the black third jersey. During that season, on February 3, 2015, the team wore an updated version of the fisherman jersey for warmups before their game against the\nFlorida Panthers\n.\n[\n187\n]\n[\n188\n]\nThe Islanders retired the Stadium Series third jersey after only one season, replacing it with a new black alternate that was unveiled to coincide with the team's move to Brooklyn. Unlike the previous black alternate, this version featured little blue and orange at all (these colors appear only on the rear collar), while the \"NY\" insignia that was carried over from the Stadium Series jersey was stripped of its chrome accents. The four narrow white stripes on the sleeves symbolize the franchise's four Stanley Cup wins.\nWhen the NHL switched to\nAdidas\nas its uniform provider in 2017, the Islanders kept their primary jerseys mostly intact except for the restoration of the blue trim in the primary logo on the road jersey. As with all NHL teams, the Islanders only wore two jerseys for the 2017\u201318 season, thus retiring the all-black third jerseys.\nThe Islanders released a new blue third jersey for the 2018\u201319 season, featuring an updated \"NY\" insignia (shorter \"Y-stick\" with four orange stripes on the blade), white shoulder yoke (reminiscent of the 2014 Stadium Series alternates), the map of Long Island on the collar, and orange numbers that call back to the jerseys used during the team's inaugural season.\n[\n189\n]\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the Islanders released a special \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform. The uniform resembled their current home jerseys, but used the navy blue and bright orange scheme worn from 1995 to 2010.\n[\n190\n]\nA second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was released in the 2022\u201323 season, using the \"Fisherman\" uniform from 1995 to 1997 but with less teal elements and diagonal orange striping.\n[\n191\n]\nDuring the\n2024 Stadium Series\n, the Islanders wore navy blue jerseys with a thick orange middle stripe. \"ISLES\" in navy blue letters was added within the orange stripe, as are the navy blue numbers.\n[\n192\n]\nThe Islanders reverted to wearing only their primary jerseys after\nFanatics\ntook over as the NHL uniform provider in 2024, even though it kept most aspects of Adidas' template and retained the use of third jerseys.\nMascot and Ice Girls\n[\nedit\n]\nIce Girls at a community event in 2013\nThe Islanders' team mascot is named \"\nSparky the Dragon\n\", who served at one point as cross-promotion with the\nArena Football League\n's\nNew York Dragons\nteam, who also played their home games at Nassau Coliseum. In the mid-1990s, the Islanders had a mascot named \"Nyisles\" whose body style went from round to human-shaped, and facial features vaguely resembled the logo fisherman, excluding its red hair and beard. Nyisles was discontinued toward the end of the\n1997\u201398 season\nwhen the team distributed \"Who kidnapped Nyisles?\" flyers implying the reason for his disappearance was because of another NHL mascot, ultimately revealed to be\nToronto Maple Leafs\nmascot\nCarlton the Bear\n. Nyisles returned as the secondary mascot of the club with a brand new look in December 2022 to coincide with the return of the Fisherman logo on the team's reverse retro uniforms.\n[\n193\n]\nFrom the 2001\u201302 season to the 2014\u201315 season, the Islanders also had an ice crew named the \"Ice Girls\", made up of only women who skated onto the ice during television breaks to clean up the snow that piled up during the game.

The Islanders compete in the\nNational Hockey League\n(NHL) as a member of the\nMetropolitan Division\nin the\nEastern Conference\n. The team plays its home games at\nUBS Arena\n. The Islanders are one of three NHL franchises in the\nNew York metropolitan area\n, along with the\nNew Jersey Devils\nand\nNew York Rangers\n, and their fanbase resides primarily on\nLong Island\n.\nThe team was founded in\n1972\nas part of the NHL's maneuvers to keep a team from rival league\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) out of the newly built\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nin suburban\nUniondale, New York\n. After two years of building up the team's roster, they found almost instant success by securing 14 straight playoff berths starting with their third season. The Islanders won four consecutive\nStanley Cup\nchampionships between\n1980\nand\n1983\n, the eighth of nine\ndynasties\nrecognized by the NHL in its history. Their 19 consecutive playoff series wins between 1980 and 1984 is a feat that remains unparalleled in the history of professional sports. They are the last team in any major professional North American sport to win four consecutive championships, and to date the last NHL team to achieve a\nthree-peat\n.\nFollowing the team's dynasty era, the franchise ran into problems with money, ownership and management, an aging arena, and low attendance. Their woes were reflected on the ice, as the team has not won a division title since\n1987\u201388\n, and went 22 seasons without winning a playoff series prior to the\n2016 playoffs\n. After years of failed attempts to rebuild or replace Nassau Coliseum in suburban Long Island, the Islanders relocated to\nBarclays Center\nin Brooklyn following the\n2014\u201315 season\n.\n[\n4\n]\nIn the\n2018\u201319\nand\n2019\u201320\nseasons, the Islanders split their home games between Barclays Center and Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders played all their home games in the\n2020\u201321 season\nat Nassau Coliseum. Their\nnew arena\nnear\nBelmont Park\nwas opened in 2021.\nTen former members of the Islanders have been inducted into the\nHockey Hall of Fame\n, seven of whom\u2014\nMike Bossy\n,\nClark Gillies\n,\nDenis Potvin\n,\nBilly Smith\n,\nBryan Trottier\n, coach\nAl Arbour\n, and general manager\nBill Torrey\n\u2014were members of all four Cup-winning teams. Post-dynasty players\nPat LaFontaine\n,\nRoberto Luongo\nand\nPierre Turgeon\nwere also inducted.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe NHL heads to Long Island (1972\u20131974)\n[\nedit\n]\nIn fall 1972, the emerging\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) planned to place its New York team, the\nNew York Raiders\n, in\nNassau County\n's brand-new\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\n.\n[\n5\n]\nCounty officials did not consider the WHA a major league and wanted to keep the Raiders out.\n[\n6\n]\nWilliam Shea\n, who had helped bring\nMajor League Baseball\n's\nNew York Mets\nto the area a decade earlier, was enlisted to bring an NHL team to Long Island. Although Shea had previously worked with upstart rival leagues including the aborted\nContinental League\n, the\nAmerican Football League\nand the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n, his ultimate goal in these efforts had always been to try to persuade the established leagues to grant second franchises to New York as had been the case with the Mets (and also with the\nNew York Jets\nand\nNew York Nets\n, as a result of those teams' leagues merging with their established rivals).\nWilliam Shea\nplayed a major role in bringing a hockey team to Long Island.\nIn contrast, Shea decided there was no need to work with the WHA since unlike the initial results of his previous approaches to established leagues in the other major sports, Shea immediately found NHL president\nClarence Campbell\nto be receptive to adding a second team in New York. Nevertheless, the Islanders' bid faced opposition from the\nNew York Rangers\n, who did not want additional competition in the New York area.\n[\n7\n]\nEventually, Campbell and Shea persuaded the Rangers' owners,\nMadison Square Garden\n, to reconsider. Rangers' president\nBill Jennings\nweighed pros and cons. Another local NHL team would be compelled to compensate the Rangers for sharing the New York area. On the other hand, a WHA team would owe the Rangers nothing unless it was included in a potential NHL\u2013WHA merger, a prospect to which both Campbell and Jennings were adamantly opposed. Finally, consenting to the establishment of an NHL franchise in suburban Nassau County would help to ensure the vast majority of the Rangers' fanbase within New York City proper would continue to support the older franchise, and reduced the prospect of a rival league eventually establishing a team and fanbase there. Perhaps remembering the crucial role the Jets had played in ensuring the success of the AFL just a few years earlier as a challenger of the\nNational Football League\n, Jennings decided to help bring a new NHL team to the New York metropolitan area.\n[\n8\n]\nDespite expanding to 14 teams just two years prior, the NHL awarded a\nLong Island\n-based franchise to clothing manufacturer\nRoy Boe\n, owner of the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n's\nNew York Nets\n, on November 8, 1971.\n[\n8\n]\nThe terms included $6\u00a0million ($45.1\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) franchise fee plus a $5\u00a0million ($37.59\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) territorial fee to the Rangers.\n[\n10\n]\nAn expansion franchise was also given to\nAtlanta\n(the\nFlames\n) to keep the schedule balanced and to prevent the WHA from entering the growing market at the newly built\nOmni Coliseum\n.\n[\n7\n]\nThe New York Islanders name was unveiled by the franchise on February 15, 1972, at a\npress conference\nheld across the street from\nRoosevelt Raceway\nat a restaurant owned by\nBurt Bacharach\n.\n[\n11\n]\nMany expected it to use the \"\nLong Island Ducks\n\", after the\nEastern Hockey League\nteam that played from 1959 to 1973.\n[\n12\n]\nThe team was soon nicknamed the \"Isles\" by the local newspapers. The Islanders' arrival effectively doomed the Raiders, who played in Madison Square Garden under difficult lease terms and were forced to move to\nCherry Hill, New Jersey\nin the middle of their second season.\n[\n6\n]\nFormer\nCalifornia Golden Seals\nexecutive vice president\nBill Torrey\nwas named as the team's general manager at the same press conference as the franchise's name unveiling.\n[\n11\n]\nThe Islanders secured veteran forward\nEd Westfall\n, defenseman\nGerry Hart\n, and goaltender\nBilly Smith\nin the\n1972 expansion draft\n, along with\njunior ice hockey\nstars\nBilly Harris\n,\nLorne Henning\n, and\nBobby Nystrom\nin the\n1972 amateur draft\n.\n[\n13\n]\nSoon after the draft,\nPhil Goyette\nwas named as the team's first head coach, however he was fired halfway through the season and replaced with\nEarl Ingarfield\nand assistant coach\nAut Erickson\n.\n[\n14\n]\nUnlike most other expansion teams' general managers, Torrey made few trades for veteran players in the early years, as he was committed to building the team through the draft. Torrey stated, \"I told the owners that we're not going to beat this team next door by taking the castoffs from others teams. We'd have to develop our own stars.\"\n[\n13\n]\nBefore the season began, Westfall was named the team's first captain.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\nBy September 1972, the Islanders were waiting for the Nassau Coliseum to be completed as well as their practice facility \"The Royal Ice Rink\" in\nKings Park\n. The team was forced to practice as late as October 6, the day before their first game, at the Rangers practice rink in\nNew Hyde Park\n.\n[\n17\n]\nThe Islanders' first win came on October 12, 1972, in a 3\u20132 game against the\nLos Angeles Kings\n.\n[\n14\n]\nIn the team's first season, young players such as Smith, Nystrom, and Henning (all of whom would be part of the Islanders dynasty of the early 1980s) were given chances to prove themselves in the NHL. The young and inexperienced expansion team, however, posted a record of 12\u201360\u20136, setting an NHL record for most losses and worst overall record in a season.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n18\n]\nA highlight occurred on January 18, 1973, when they defeated the defending\nStanley Cup\nchampion\nBoston Bruins\n9\u20137.\n[\n14\n]\nFinishing last in the standings that season, they received the right to select first in the\n1973 draft\n.\n[\n18\n]\nOff the ice, the Islanders struggled financially, a situation that was exacerbated by the then-unprecedented $11 million in franchise and territorial fees.\nMontreal Canadiens\n' general manager\nSam Pollock\nwas keen to acquire the Islanders' pick so he could draft French Canadian junior star defenseman\nDenis Potvin\n, who had been touted as \"the next\nBobby Orr\n\" when he was 14 years old. Pollock made several lucrative trade offers including cash to the Islanders, but Torrey turned the Canadiens down and selected Potvin with the first overall pick.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n19\n]\nDuring the off-season, Torrey convinced former\nSt. Louis Blues\ncoach\nAl Arbour\nto come coach the Islanders.\n[\n8\n]\nEven with Arbour as the team's head coach and Potvin, who won the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\nas NHL Rookie of the Year, the team again finished last in the\nEast Division\nduring the\n1973\u201374 season\n, but allowed 100 fewer goals than the previous season. The season included their first win against the Rangers, on October 27, 1973,\n[\n5\n]\nwhich also happened to be the game where Potvin scored his first NHL goal. Although they failed to make the playoffs, their 56 points represented a 26-point improvement from the previous season.\n[\n8\n]\nAscendancy and playoff inability (1974\u20131979)\n[\nedit\n]\nDenis Potvin\nled the Islanders to playoff success in the 1970s and 1980s.\nWith the 4th and 22nd picks in the\n1974 draft\n, the Islanders added young forwards\nClark Gillies\nand\nBryan Trottier\nto continue Torrey's building plan.\n[\n20\n]\nIn the\n1974\u201375 season\n, the Islanders made one of the biggest turnarounds in NHL history. Led by Potvin, forwards Westfall, Harris, Nystrom, Gillies, and goaltenders Smith and\nGlenn \"Chico\" Resch\n, the team earned 88 points, 32 more than the previous season and two more than their first two seasons combined, earning their first playoff berth. They defeated the rival\nNew York Rangers\nin a best-of-3 first-round series as\nJ. P. Parise\nscored just 11 seconds into overtime of the third game.\n[\n8\n]\nIn the next round, down three games to none in a best-of-seven series against the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, the Islanders rallied to win the next four and take the series-winning game 7 on a late third-period goal by Westfall. Only four other major North American professional sports teams have accomplished this feat (the\n1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs\n,\n2004 Boston Red Sox\n, the\n2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers\n, and the\n2013\u201314 Los Angeles Kings\n).\n[\n21\n]\nThey were close but not as lucky in the following round, rallying from another 3\u20130 deficit to force a seventh game against the defending\nStanley Cup\nchampion\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nbefore the Flyers took the decisive seventh game at home and went on to win the Cup again.\n[\n8\n]\nDespite a disappointing playoff finish, Arbour remained complimentary of the team's attitude and maturity, saying \"If I called a practice next week, every one of them would show up.\"\n[\n22\n]\nThe Islanders continued their climb up the standings in\n1975\u201376\n, earning 101 points and the fifth-best record in the league.\n[\n23\n]\nIt was the first 100-point season in Islanders history, in only their fourth year of existence.\n[\n24\n]\nRookie center Trottier finished the season with 95 points and won the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n; his points and assists (63) totals set a new league record for most in each category by a rookie.\n[\n25\n]\nIt would be the first of four consecutive 100-point seasons, including the first two division titles in franchise history.\n[\n24\n]\n[\n26\n]\nDespite the emergence of young star players and regular season success between 1976 and 1979 the Islanders suffered a series of playoff disappointments. In\n1976\nand\n1977 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, the Islanders were knocked out in the semifinals by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the\nMontreal Canadiens\n.\n[\n27\n]\nThe Canadiens posted a 24\u20133 record in the playoffs during those two seasons with all three losses coming at the hands of the Islanders.\n[\n28\n]\nMike Bossy\nwas selected with the 15th overall pick in\n1977\nand became the third Islander to win the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n.\nIn the\n1977 draft\n, Torrey had the 15th overall pick and was deciding between forwards\nMike Bossy\nand\nDwight Foster\n. Bossy was known as an emerging scorer who lacked physicality. Foster was known as a solid\nchecker\nwith marginal offensive ability (despite having led the\nOntario Hockey League\nin scoring). Arbour persuaded Torrey to pick Bossy, arguing it was easier to teach a scorer how to check.\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nIn the\n1977\u201378 season\n, Bossy became the third Islander to win the Calder Trophy, and scored 53 goals that season, a rookie record at the time.\n[\n8\n]\nThe team earned their first Patrick Division and Campbell Conference championships.\n[\n14\n]\nSix players finished the season with 30 goals scored or more, with five of them Islanders draft picks, showing the success of the draft building process.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n31\n]\nThe season ended with a familiar result in the\nplayoffs\n, as the team lost in overtime in game 7 of the quarterfinals against the\nToronto Maple Leafs\n.\n[\n29\n]\nIn\n1978\u201379\n, the team finished with the best record in the NHL, clinching it with three goals in the third period of the season's final game against the Rangers. Trottier won the\nHart Memorial Trophy\nas league MVP and captured the\nArt Ross Trophy\nfor the most points, while sophomore Bossy scored 69 goals, which also led the league. Despite their regular season dominance, the Islanders exited the playoffs with another upset playoff loss, this time to the Rangers in the semifinals. As the team was leaving\nMadison Square Garden\nfollowing their game 6 elimination, Rangers fans rocked and threw objects at the team's bus. Hockey professionals and journalists generally questioned whether the Islanders were capable of winning the important games needed to win a Stanley Cup championship. Islander players would cite fear of repeating the pain of this loss as spurring their later success. After transferring the captaincy to Gillies the season before, Westfall retired and shortly thereafter became a color commentator on the team's telecasts.\nOff the ice, the Islanders were on shaky ground. Boe was losing money on both his franchises, even as the Islanders quickly surged to NHL prominence and the Nets became an ABA power. The Islanders were still far behind on the $10\u00a0million they had paid in startup costs, and the expansion and territorial fees associated with moving the Nets to the\nNational Basketball Association\nthrew Boe's finances into a tailspin. Eventually, Boe was forced to sell both his teams. He readily found a buyer for the Nets, but had less luck finding one for the Islanders. Torrey orchestrated a sale to one of the team's limited partners,\nJohn Pickett\n. In return, Pickett promoted Torrey to team president, though Torrey had already been operating head of the franchise before then. Soon after purchasing the team, Pickett signed a very lucrative\ncable television\ncontract with the fledgling\nSportsChannel\nnetwork as their owner,\nCharles Dolan\n, thought the up-and-coming Islanders would be a perfect centerpiece for his new network. Dolan gave Pickett a long-term guaranteed contract intended not only to keep the team on Long Island, but give area governments an incentive to renew his cable contracts. The Islanders have remained on the network, now known as\nMSG Sportsnet\n, for over four decades.\nThe Dynasty (1979\u20131983)\n[\nedit\n]\nAfter the Islanders' regular season dominance and playoff disappointment in 1979, Arbour decided that he would no longer concern himself too greatly with his team's finish in the regular season. Instead, he focused his team's energy on how they would perform in the playoffs. In\n1980\n, the Islanders dropped below the 100-point mark for the first time in five years, earning only 91 points. However, they finally broke through and won the\nStanley Cup\n.\nBefore the\n1980\nplayoffs, the Islanders acquired\nButch Goring\nfrom the\nLos Angeles Kings\n. Goring's arrival was often called the \"final piece of the puzzle.\"\nBefore the playoffs, Torrey made the difficult decision to trade longtime and popular veterans Billy Harris and defenseman\nDave Lewis\nto the\nLos Angeles Kings\nfor second line center\nButch Goring\n. Goring's arrival is often called the \"final piece of the puzzle\",\n[\n32\n]\na strong two-way player, his presence on the second line ensured that opponents would no longer be able to focus their defensive efforts on the Islanders' first line of Bossy, Trottier and\nClark Gillies\n. Contributions from new teammates, such as wingers\nDuane Sutter\nand\nAnders Kallur\nand\nstay-at-home defensemen\nDave Langevin\n,\nGord Lane\n, and\nKen Morrow\n(the latter fresh off a gold medal win at the\n1980 Olympics\n), also figured prominently in the Islanders' playoff success.\nIn the playoffs, the Islanders defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3\u20131 in the preliminary round, then beat the Boston Bruins 4\u20131 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, the Islanders faced the\nBuffalo Sabres\n, who had finished second overall in the NHL standings. The Islanders won the first two games in Buffalo, including a 2\u20131 victory in game two on\nBob Nystrom\n's goal in double overtime. They went on to win the series in six games and reach the finals for the first time in franchise history, where they would face the NHL's regular season champions, the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, who had gone undefeated for 35 straight games (25\u20130\u201310) during the regular season. In game one in\nPhiladelphia\n, the Islanders won 4\u20133 on\nDenis Potvin\n's power-play goal in overtime. Leading the series 3\u20132, they went home to Long Island for game six. In that game the Islanders blew a 4\u20132 lead in the third period but Nystrom continued his overtime heroics, scoring at 7:11 of the extra frame, on assists by John Tonelli and Lorne Henning, to bring Long Island its first Stanley Cup championship. This was the most recent Stanley Cup-clinching game won in overtime by the home team until the Los Angeles Kings did it in 2014. It was also the Islanders' sixth overtime victory of the playoffs. Bryan Trottier won the\nConn Smythe Trophy\nas the most valuable player in the playoffs. Torrey's strategy of building through the draft turned out very well; nearly all of the major contributors on the 1980 champions were home-grown Islanders or had spent most of their NHL careers in the Islanders organization. The Islanders were the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup with Europeans (\nStefan Persson\nand Kallur) on its roster.\n[\n33\n]\nThe Islanders dominated the next two seasons. Bossy scored\n50 goals in 50 games\nin\n1981\nand the Islanders lost only three playoff games en route to defeating the\nMinnesota North Stars\nin five games to win the Stanley Cup. Goring won the Conn Smythe Trophy. During their semifinals sweep of the Rangers, Islander fans began taunting the Rangers with a chant of \"\n1940!\n\"\u00a0\u2013 referring to the Rangers' last Stanley Cup win in\n1940\n(the Rangers would not win the cup again until\n1994\n). Fans in other NHL cities soon picked up the chant.\n[\n34\n]\nThese four banners hung in\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nand represent the four\nStanley Cup\nchampionships the Islanders won from 1980 through 1983.\nIn\n1981\u201382\n, the Islanders won a then-record 15 straight games en route to a franchise-record 118 points, while\nMike Bossy\nset a scoring record for right-wingers with 147 points in an 80-game schedule. The Islanders finished with the most points in the league (118), yet once in the playoffs against the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nthey found themselves down late in the third period of deciding game 5 before\nJohn Tonelli\nscored both the tying goal and the overtime winner. After defeating the Rangers in six games they swept both the\nQuebec Nordiques\nand the\nVancouver Canucks\nin the first-ever coast-to-coast\nStanley Cup Finals\nfor their third straight championship. During that series Bossy, upended by a check from\nTiger Williams\nand falling parallel to the ice, managed to hook the puck with his stick and score. Bossy netted the Stanley Cup-winning goal and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nThe next year, although the Islanders had won the Stanley Cup three straight times, more attention was being paid to the upstart\nEdmonton Oilers\n, whose young superstar\nWayne Gretzky\nhad just shattered existing scoring records.\n[\n35\n]\nIn\n1982\u201383\nthe Oilers had a better regular season, but the Islanders swept them in the\nStanley Cup Finals\nto win their fourth straight championship.\nBilly Smith\nwas named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner after shutting down the Oilers' vaunted scoring machine. Gretzky failed to score a goal during the series.\n[\n36\n]\nDuane and\nBrent Sutter\nscored seven and five points respectively in the first three games, while Bossy again scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in game four. After that game, the Oilers players walked past the Islanders' dressing room and were surprised to see the champions exhausted. Oilers players such as Gretzky and\nMark Messier\nsaid that they realized at that moment how much it would actually take to win the Stanley Cup.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\nPost-dynasty and the Easter Epic (1983\u20131991)\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders finished the\n1983\u201384 regular season\ntied atop the Prince of Wales Conference while successfully defending their Patrick Division title. The \"Drive for Five\" got off to a tense start. Late in the deciding game of their first-round series against the Rangers,\nDon Maloney\ntied the game with a controversial goal as the Islanders believed Maloney's stick was too high. They ultimately eliminated the Rangers for the fourth consecutive year. The team then defeated the\nWashington Capitals\nin five games and the\nMontreal Canadiens\nin six to set up a finals rematch with the Oilers. The series featured rookie\nPat LaFontaine\nscoring two third-period goals in 38 seconds. This time, the Oilers dethroned the Islanders to win the first of what would be five Stanley Cup victories in seven years. For the\n1984 playoffs\n, the NHL changed the home and away schedule for the finals, which provided the Islanders home-ice advantage in the series based on Wales Conference teams collectively having a winning record in regular season games versus Campbell Conference opponents,\n[\n38\n]\ndespite finishing lower than them in the overall standings. The new format had them play three straight games in Edmonton, where the Oilers managed to lock up the series, after the teams had split the first two games in New York. Bossy cited the team's hard time winning an away game as their downfall in the series.\n[\n39\n]\nThe Oilers also ended the Islanders' 19-series playoff winning streak. It remains the longest streak in the history of professional sports (one more than the 1959\u20131967 streak by the\nBoston Celtics\nof the NBA). Unlike the 1976\u20131979 Montreal Canadiens, who needed to win three series in the 1976 and 1977 playoffs under the playoff format in place at that time, the Islanders had to win four series in each of their Stanley Cup seasons.\nThe Islanders remained competitive for the rest of the decade, even as some of the stars from the Cup teams departed. As the decade wore on, Pickett began to keep the money from the team's cable deal rather than reinvest it in the team as he had done in years past. Although it did not become clear immediately, the lack of funds limited Torrey's ability to replace all of the departing talent. In the\n1984\u201385 NHL season\n, the Islanders slipped to third in their division, followed by similar results in the\n1985\u201386\nand\n1986\u201387\nseasons. They began facing stiff competition from division rivals, the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, who eliminated the Islanders in the division finals in 1985 and 1987, and the Capitals, who swept the Islanders' 1986 first-round series, the team's first exit without winning a playoff round since 1978.\nKelly Hrudey\n(pictured in 2006) saved 73 of 75 shots in the \"\nEaster Epic\n\" for the Islanders, who came out victorious after four periods of overtime play.\nIn 1986, Nystrom retired due to a serious injury\n[\n40\n]\nand\nClark Gillies\nwas picked up on waivers by the\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\n[\n41\n]\nArbour retired as coach following the\n1985\u201386 season\nand was replaced by longtime junior hockey coach\nTerry Simpson\n.\n[\n42\n]\nDuring the first round of the\n1987 playoffs\nagainst the Capitals, the Islanders had fallen behind in the series three games to one but were not eliminated due to a playoff format change from a best-of-5 series to a best-of-7.\n[\n43\n]\nThe Islanders evened the series, which set the stage for one of the most famous games in NHL history: the \"\nEaster Epic\n\".\nKelly Hrudey\nstopped 73 shots on goal while Pat LaFontaine scored at 8:47 of the fourth overtime\u2014and at 1:56\u00a0a.m. on\nEaster Sunday\nmorning. The win came even though the Islanders had been outshot 75\u201352.\n[\n44\n]\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\nThey were eliminated in the division finals in seven games by the Flyers.\n[\n47\n]\nChronic back pain forced\nMike Bossy\nto retire after the season.\n[\n48\n]\nThe\nfollowing season\n, the Islanders captured another division title,\n[\n49\n]\nbut were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the upstart\nNew Jersey Devils\n.\n[\n50\n]\nPotvin retired after the playoffs, holding records for most career goals (310), assists (742) and points (1052) by a defenseman, though he has since been passed in these categories by\nRay Bourque\nand\nPaul Coffey\n. Around this time, the team's run of good luck in the draft began to run out. Of their four top draft picks from 1987 to 1990, they lost one to a freak knee injury and two others never panned out.\n[\n51\n]\nThe\n1988\u201389 season\nsaw the Islanders win only seven of their first 27 games. Torrey fired Simpson and brought Arbour back. Arbour was unable to turn things around, and the team finished with 61 points, tied with the\nQuebec Nordiques\nfor the worst record in the league. It was their first losing season and the first time missing the playoffs since their second season. Smith, the last remaining original Islanders player, retired after the season to become the team's goaltending coach. Not long after the end of the season, Pickett moved to Florida and turned day-to-day operations over to a committee of four Long Island entrepreneurs: Ralph Palleschi, Bob Rosenthal,\nStephen Walsh\n, and\nPaul Greenwood\n. In return, they each bought a 2.5% interest in the team.\n[\n51\n]\nIn the\nnext season\n, the Islanders rebounded to get back into the playoffs, but fell to the Rangers in five games of the opening round. The team bought out the remaining years of\nBryan Trottier\n's contract, sending him off with a team record of games played. The\n1990\u201391 season\nhad the team finish well out of the playoffs after winning only 25 games.\nNew faces and the 1993 run (1991\u20131995)\n[\nedit\n]\nLaFontaine was frustrated with the team's lack of success and the progress of his contract negotiations, and held out rather than report to camp before\n1991\u201392\n. In response to the holdout, Torrey engineered a rebuilding project with two blockbuster trades on October 25, 1991. He dealt LaFontaine,\nRandy Wood\nand\nRandy Hillier\n(along with future considerations) to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin return for\nPierre Turgeon\n,\nBenoit Hogue\n,\nUwe Krupp\nand\nDave McLlwain\n. He also sent longtime captain\nBrent Sutter\nand\nBrad Lauer\nto the\nChicago Blackhawks\nfor\nSteve Thomas\nand\nAdam Creighton\n. With these additions and a talented core of players such as\nDerek King\n,\nRay Ferraro\n, and\nPatrick Flatley\n, along with incoming\nSoviet\nplayers\nVladimir Malakhov\nand\nDarius Kasparaitis\n, the Islanders had a new foundation in the early 1990s. The management committee, however, was not nearly as patient as Boe and Pickett had been, and forced Torrey to resign after the Islanders missed the playoffs again that season. Assistant general manager\nDon Maloney\nwas hired in Torrey's place,\n[\n51\n]\nwhile Torrey quickly resurfaced with the expansion\nFlorida Panthers\n.\nIn Maloney's first year,\n1992\u201393\n, the Islanders rebounded to make the playoffs, in the process surpassing the 80-point mark for the first time in five years. The LaFontaine-Turgeon trade proved successful for both the Islanders and Sabres, as both players hit career highs in points and Turgeon won the\nLady Byng Trophy\n.\nRay Ferraro emerged as a playoff hero, scoring a pair of overtime winners in the first-round series against the Capitals. Instead of celebrating after winning game 6 at Nassau Coliseum, however, the Islanders were both irate and despondent. Only seconds after Turgeon, the team's star center and leading scorer, scored an insurance goal in the series-clinching game,\nDale Hunter\nviolently checked him from behind. Turgeon was believed to be out for the entire second round, if not longer, with a separated shoulder. He returned only for spot power-play duty in the last game of the second round. Hunter received a 21-game suspension, at the time the longest for on-ice misconduct in modern NHL history.\nThe Islanders' next opponent, the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, were twice-defending Stanley Cup champions and full of stars such as\nMario Lemieux\n,\nJaromir Jagr\n, and\nRon Francis\n. The Penguins had roared through the regular season with 119 points, as well as recording a record 17 consecutive wins towards the end of the season, and were overwhelmingly favored to win a third straight championship. Jim Smith of\nNewsday\npredicted that with Turgeon on the sidelines, the Penguins would sweep the Islanders out of the playoffs, however on the strength of outstanding goaltending from\nGlenn Healy\nand contributions from all four lines, the Islanders achieved a huge upset when\nDavid Volek\nscored at 5:16 of overtime of the deciding seventh game.\nNewsday'\ns front page the day following the win was a picture of Healy with a headline reading, \"It's a Miracle!\" This was the last playoff series won by the Islanders for 23 years, until the 2015\u201316 season. Turgeon returned to the Islanders' top line for the conference finals against the\nMontreal Canadiens\n, though he was not in peak form as he had not fully recovered. The Islanders bowed out of the playoffs after a hard-fought five games, two of which went to overtime. After beating the Islanders, the Canadiens went on to win the Cup.\nMaloney had avoided making many personnel changes his first year, but on the eve of the\n1993 expansion draft\nhe traded backup goaltender\nMark Fitzpatrick\nto the\nQuebec Nordiques\nfor\nRon Hextall\n. The clubs also exchanged first-round picks in the deal. Able to protect only one netminder in the expansion draft, the Islanders left Healy exposed. He was claimed by the\nMighty Ducks of Anaheim\n, then was claimed by the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nin Phase II of the draft the next day, and finally had his rights traded to the Rangers, where he became the backup.\nThe Islanders barely squeezed past the Panthers to make the 1994 playoffs before being swept in a lopsided opening series by the first-place Rangers, who went on to win the Cup. It would be the Islanders' last playoff appearance until\n2002\n. Arbour retired for good as coach and was succeeded by longtime assistant\nLorne Henning\n. Hextall, who allowed 16 goals in three games, drew most of the criticism for the failed playoff campaign and was shipped to Philadelphia for\nTommy Soderstrom\nin September. In the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season, the Islanders not only failed to qualify for the playoffs, they finished ahead of only the third-year\nOttawa Senators\n.\nManagement issues (1995\u20132000)\n[\nedit\n]\nBy the end of the 1994\u201395 season, Maloney was under considerable heat from the press and fan base for his handling of the team. Since taking over in 1992, the only noticeable attempt he made to upgrade the roster was the acquisition of Hextall. Near the end of the failed 1995 campaign, Maloney decided that the core of players he had left alone for three seasons needed to be revamped, leading to a rebuilding project. He traded Turgeon and Malakhov to the\nMontreal Canadiens\nfor\nKirk Muller\nand\nMathieu Schneider\n, while Hogue was sent to\nToronto\nfor young goaltender\nEric Fichaud\n. Additionally, Maloney allowed the team's leading scorer, Ferraro, to depart as an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of the season. Fans' displeasure at Maloney for trading the popular Turgeon was magnified when Muller balked at joining a rebuilding team. He played 45 games for the Islanders before being sent to Toronto as well.\nBefore the\n1995\u201396 season\n, Maloney fired Henning and named\nMike Milbury\nhead coach. The same year, the Islanders' attempt at updating their look resulted in the unveiling of a new team logo of a slicker-clad fisherman holding a hockey stick. Islanders fans disliked it, and rival Rangers' fans mockingly called the Islanders \"\nfishsticks\n\"\u2014mocking how the logo resembled the\nGorton's Fisherman\n. The team reverted to a modified version of the old logo as soon as the league allowed them to do so. (In spite of this, the logo found renewed popularity as a throwback design in the late 2010s and early 2020s, enough so that the team would revive it as their third \"Reverse Retro\" jersey in 2022 and would use an adjusted version of the logo for their AHL team, the\nBridgeport Islanders\n, beginning in 2024.) The year was a disappointment on the ice as well, as the Islanders finished in last place with a record of 22\u201350\u201310. During the season, team management fired Maloney, whom fans blamed for the team's downfall,\n[\n52\n]\nand gave Milbury full control of hockey operations as both a coach and general manager. Milbury went on to resign as head coach during the\nfollowing season\nand elevated assistant\nRick Bowness\nto the position. After another unsuccessful season with little improvement, Milbury took over as coach again during the\n1997\u201398 season\n. The team improved to fourth place in their division but again failed to make the playoffs. Milbury followed by once again stepping down as coach during the\nfollowing season\nwhile retaining his job as general manager.\nDuring the continued playoff drought, instability in the front office mirrored the Islanders' substandard performance on the ice. Pickett sold the team to\nDallas\nbusinessman\nJohn Spano\nin 1996. However, three months after the 1997 closing, Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of the first installment on the cable rights deal. Several Islanders executives tipped off\nNewsday\nthat something was amiss about their new boss.\n[\n53\n]\nIn July,\nNewsday\nexposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required to complete the deal. The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth, and also had two lawsuits pending against him. Within days of the report, Spano was forced to relinquish the team to Pickett. Federal prosecutors turned up evidence that Spano had forged many of the documents used to vouch for his wealth and to promise payment to Pickett, and even appeared to have sent many of the documents from his own office in Dallas. He was sentenced to 71 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. The NHL took additional heat when reports surfaced that the league spent well under $1,000 (depending on the source, the league spent either $525\n[\n53\n]\nor $750\n[\n51\n]\n) to check Spano's background. It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners. The incident and its aftermath were covered in the\nESPN\n30 for 30\ndocumentary,\nBig Shot\n.\n[\n54\n]\nPickett finally found a buyer, a group led by\nHoward Milstein\nand\nPhoenix Coyotes\nco-owner Steven Gluckstern, a deal which almost fell through when\nSpectacor Management Group\n, which managed the Coliseum for Nassau County, tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was safe. Pickett refused, since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in recent seasons. SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders, the NHL, and Nassau County officials.\nInitially, the team made numerous trades and increased their payroll in an effort to assemble a better team. In one transaction, young players\nTodd Bertuzzi\nand\nBryan McCabe\nwere traded for veteran\nTrevor Linden\n. After the Islanders finished 12 points short of the playoffs in the 1997\u201398 season, however, Milstein and Gluckstern decided to run the team on an austere budget in an attempt to make a profit. They also complained about the condition of the Nassau Coliseum and made noises about moving the team elsewhere. They began trading or releasing many popular players to avoid paying their salaries, including star scorer\nZigmund Palffy\n, team captain Linden, former rookie of the year\nBryan Berard\n, and rugged defenseman\nRich Pilon\n. Losing the highly regarded players, the team finished with similar results the next two seasons. Attendance, which had been in a steady decline over the past few years, decreased even further to under 12,000 per game. Around that time, Milstein bid hundreds of millions of dollars in unsuccessful attempts to purchase the\nNational Football League\n's\nWashington Redskins\nand\nCleveland Browns\n.\nNew ownership and a return to the playoffs (2000\u20132006)\n[\nedit\n]\nLet's face it, the Coliseum is a dump, and the team, well, they're losers. It's a real shame. We want to see it change because this is our home. We all deserve better.\n\u2014\nCharles Wang\n[\n55\n]\nIn 2000, Milstein and Gluckstern sold the team to\nComputer Associates\nexecutives\nCharles Wang\nand\nSanjay Kumar\n. The sale cost $187.5\u00a0million ($342.36\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) and gave fans hope for the team to turn its lack of success around.\n[\n55\n]\nThe new owners allowed Milbury to spend money and invest in free agents. His first attempt proved unpopular with fans, as he traded away future star players\nRoberto Luongo\nand\nOlli Jokinen\nto the\nFlorida Panthers\nfor\nOleg Kvasha\nand\nMark Parrish\n. Milbury then further surprised the hockey world when he took\nRick DiPietro\nwith the first selection in the\n2000 draft\n, ahead of consensus picks\nDany Heatley\nand\nMarian Gaborik\n. Reporters and fans were alternately confused and enraged by the moves, which Milbury acknowledged, saying, \"As dangerous as this may be, we think Mad Mike maybe has something going for him.\"\n[\n56\n]\nEstablishing a record of controversial decisions, Milbury held onto the \"Mad Mike\" nickname for years to follow. He remained adamant that his moves were to immediately improve the team, whose poor winning percentage that year was ahead of only the franchise's first season.\n[\n57\n]\nThe team's uninspired play led Milbury to fire head coach and past player\nButch Goring\n. Fans vocalized their dislike of Goring taking the fall rather than Milbury, which was further worsened when Milbury passed on hiring\nTed Nolan\nas Goring's successor; Instead,\nBoston Bruins\nassistant coach\nPeter Laviolette\nwas hired.\n[\n58\n]\nThe Islanders acquired\nAlexei Yashin\n(left) prior to the\n2001\u201302 season\n. Yashin would go on to become the team's captain in later years.\nThree key personnel acquisitions were made prior to the 2001\u201302 season, Laviolette's first.\nAlexei Yashin\nwas acquired from the\nOttawa Senators\nin exchange for forward\nBill Muckalt\n, defenseman\nZdeno Chara\nand the Islanders' second overall pick in the\n2001 draft\n. Next, Islanders prospects\nTim Connolly\nand\nTaylor Pyatt\nwere traded to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin exchange for\nMichael Peca\n, who became the team's captain.\n[\n59\n]\n[\n60\n]\nBy virtue of finishing with the worst record in the previous season,\nDetroit Red Wings\ngoaltender\nChris Osgood\nwas the next addition, taken as the first pick in the September 2001 waiver draft, adding a former Stanley Cup championship goaltender without giving up any players in exchange.\n[\n61\n]\nThe additions proved to be a great help, as the team opened the season with a 9\u20130\u20131\u20131 record, the best in franchise history. They finished the season with new broken records; their 96 points marked the fourth biggest one-year turnaround in the league's history (44 points higher than the previous season), while Osgood's 66 starts surpassed\nRon Hextall\n's previous record of 65.\n[\n22\n]\nDuring the\n2002 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, they were seeded fifth and faced the fourth-seeded\nToronto Maple Leafs\n. The Islanders lost in a very physical first-round series in seven games; the home team won every game of the series. Notably, game 5 featured\nGary Roberts\ncharging Islander defenseman\nKenny Jonsson\n, and\nDarcy Tucker\nsubmarining Peca with a questionable check that tore the Islander captain's\nanterior cruciate ligament\n, sidelining both players for the series' final game. The situation between Tucker and Peca caused a bit of outrage, with speculation that Tucker had intended to injure Peca before the game had begun, which Tucker denied.\n[\n62\n]\nDespite the promise shown in the Toronto playoff series, the Islanders had a slow start to the\n2002\u201303 season\n. They rebounded to make the playoffs, but lost a five-game series in the first round to the top-seeded\nOttawa Senators\n.\n[\n63\n]\nMilbury continued his controversial move-making by firing Laviolette after the season, citing postseason interviews with the players in which they expressed a lack of confidence in the coach.\n[\n64\n]\nHe was replaced with\nSteve Stirling\n, who had previously been coaching the team's top minor league affiliate, the\nBridgeport Sound Tigers\n. In the\nfollowing season\n, the Islanders again lost in the first round of the playoffs, this time to the eventual champion\nTampa Bay Lightning\n.\n[\n65\n]\nFollowing the\n2004\u201305 NHL lockout\n, which eliminated that season of play, the Islanders made several player moves to increase offense for\nfollowing season\n. Peca was traded to the\nEdmonton Oilers\nfor center\nMike York\n, freeing up room under the NHL's new salary cap.\n[\n66\n]\nThe same day, the team signed winger\nMiroslav Satan\nto play alongside Yashin.\n[\n67\n]\nMilbury also worked on remaking the team's defense, adding\nAlexei Zhitnik\n,\nBrad Lukowich\nand\nBrent Sopel\nto replace the departed\nAdrian Aucoin\nand\nRoman Hamrlik\n, who left as free agents, and Jonsson, who left the NHL to play in the\nHockeyAllsvenskan\nin Sweden.\n[\n68\n]\nIn the aftermath, Yashin was named as the team's new captain.\n[\n69\n]\nThe team's inconsistent play led to Stirling's dismissal midway through the season.\n[\n14\n]\nManagement shake-ups and the DiPietro contract (2006\u20132009)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn the day of Stirling's firing, January 11, 2006, Milbury also announced that he would step down as general manager once a successor was found.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n70\n]\nHe served as vice president of Wang's sports properties for one year before resigning in May 2007.\n[\n71\n]\nWang proceeded by hiring\nNeil Smith\nas general manager and\nTed Nolan\nas head coach, following a brief stint by\nBrad Shaw\nas the team's interim head coach.\n[\n72\n]\n[\n73\n]\nSmith, however, was fired after approximately one month and quickly replaced by the team's backup goaltender\nGarth Snow\n, who retired from his playing career to accept the position.\n[\n22\n]\nBefore his dismissal, Smith made several free agent acquisitions, including defensemen\nBrendan Witt\nand\nTom Poti\n, and forwards\nMike Sillinger\nand\nChris Simon\n.\n[\n72\n]\nOn September 12, 2006, the Islanders signed DiPietro to a 15-year, $67.5\u00a0million ($105.28\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) contract, which was believed to be the longest contract to date in the NHL and the second-longest in North American sports, behind a 25-year contract for\nNational Basketball Association\nplayer\nMagic Johnson\n.\n[\n74\n]\n[\n75\n]\nDiPietro, Wang and Snow all spoke confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides, despite the mixed reactions it received from the rest of the hockey world. Specifically, Wang stated, \"This is not a big deal. You have to have a commitment to who you're working with.\"\n[\n74\n]\nAs speculation began as to whether other teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players,\nAtlanta Thrashers\n' general manager\nDon Waddell\nfelt that, \"It's highly unlikely that you will see teams go beyond that. This is a once-in-a-lifetime contract. Ownership must feel very strongly that he's their guy for the next 15 years.\"\n[\n75\n]\nBill Guerin\nwas the team captain from 2007 to 2009.\nThe new-look Islanders were picked by most analysts to languish towards the bottom of the standings.\n[\n76\n]\nEyeing a playoff spot, Snow traded for forward\nRyan Smyth\nfrom the\nEdmonton Oilers\nat the trade deadline on February 27, 2007.\n[\n77\n]\nInjuries to DiPietro provided extra setbacks, but not enough to drop the team from playoff contention.\n[\n78\n]\n[\n79\n]\nThey qualified for the playoffs, assisted by a late-season winning streak and a 3\u20132 shootout victory against the\nNew Jersey Devils\nin their final regular season game.\n[\n80\n]\nDespite DiPietro's return to the team in time for the playoffs, the team lost their first round matchup in five games to the\nPresidents' Trophy\n-winning\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\n[\n81\n]\nManagement announced in June 2007 that they would buy out captain\nAlexei Yashin\n's contract, which had four seasons remaining on it.\n[\n82\n]\nFree agents Smyth, Poti,\nViktor Kozlov\n,\nJason Blake\n, and\nRichard Zednik\nalso left in July 2007.\n[\n83\n]\n[\n84\n]\nDuring that month, the Islanders signed\nBill Guerin\nto a two-year contract as he immediately assumed team captaincy.\n[\n83\n]\nAlso in the off-season, free agents\nMike Comrie\n,\nAndy Sutton\nand\nJon Sim\njoined the team.\n[\n85\n]\n[\n86\n]\nThat summer, it was announced that Nolan extended an invitation to Al Arbour to return as a coach for one game in order to bring his total number of games coached to 1,500.\n[\n87\n]\n[\n88\n]\nArbour signed a one-day contract, the shortest in league history, on November 3, 2007; it put him behind the bench the following day as the Islanders defeated the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n3\u20132, raising his career coaching win total to 740.\n[\n89\n]\nThe team remained in the playoff hunt through the trade deadline as they re-signed Comrie to a one-year contract and traded away Simon and\nMarc-Andre Bergeron\n.\n[\n90\n]\nA rash of injuries saw them plummet to the fifth-worst record in the league by the end of the season.\n[\n91\n]\nJosh Bailey\nwas drafted by the Islanders in 2008, to provide depth at the wing for the team.\nAt the\n2008 NHL entry draft\n, the Islanders made two trades to move down from the fifth to the ninth overall pick, with which they selected center\nJosh Bailey\n. They also added free agents\nMark Streit\nand\nDoug Weight\n. The team dismissed head coach\nTed Nolan\nover alleged philosophy differences,\n[\n92\n]\n[\n93\n]\nand later that summer replaced him with\nScott Gordon\n.\n[\n94\n]\nNear the trade deadline, Snow traded Comrie and\nChris Campoli\nto the\nOttawa Senators\nin exchange for forward\nDean McAmmond\nand the\nSan Jose Sharks\n' first-round draft pick in the\n2009 NHL entry draft\nand sent captain Bill Guerin to the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin exchange for a conditional draft pick.\n[\n95\n]\n[\n96\n]\nIn the\n2008\u201309 season\n, the Islanders finished in last place in the league with a record of 26\u201347\u20139, which was the team's worst record since the 2000\u201301 season. After the conclusion of regular season, they won the draft lottery to retain the first overall pick in the\n2009 NHL entry draft\n.\n[\n97\n]\nThe Tavares era begins (2009\u20132015)\n[\nedit\n]\nBeginning an effort to rebuild the team with new and young talent, the Islanders selected\nJohn Tavares\nwith the first-overall pick of the\n2009 NHL entry draft\n.\n[\n98\n]\nTavares went into the draft as the top prospect in the majority of scouting reports,\n[\n99\n]\nand it was widely expected that the Islanders would select him after they secured the first overall pick by winning the draft lottery, although there was plenty of competition between Tavares,\nVictor Hedman\n, and\nMatt Duchene\n.\n[\n100\n]\nNHL Central Scouting Bureau\n's Chris Edwards spoke highly of him, stating, \"[Tavares] is phenomenal at getting the puck through traffic to his linemates, getting to opening. The way he reads the play and can get to where he figures the rebounds will be and bangs in the rebound. He's a real smart player.\"\n[\n101\n]\nThey traded up twice in the first round to also select defenseman\nCalvin de Haan\nwith the 12th overall pick,\n[\n102\n]\nas well as\nCasey Cizikas\nand\nAnders Lee\nin later rounds, all of whom would go on to play consistently on the main roster by the\n2014\u201315 season\n.\n[\n103\n]\nThe\n2009\u201310 season\nstarted out slow, with the team winless its first six games.\n[\n104\n]\nThe team continued to play inconsistently due to injuries as many wrote them off as potential playoff contenders.\n[\n105\n]\nThe team hit a mid-season hot streak,\n[\n106\n]\nhowever nine losses in 11 games before the Olympic break set them right back.\n[\n107\n]\nThey ultimately ended up at bottom of the standings again, finishing the season 26th in the league.\n[\n108\n]\nThe placement led to a fifth overall pick in\n2010\n. Continuing with their rebuilding process, they used the first round to draft young forwards\nNino Niederreiter\nand\nBrock Nelson\nwith picks five and 30, respectively.\n[\n109\n]\nAs the\n2010\u201311 season\ngot underway, the team quickly fell into a ten-game losing streak, leading to the firing of head coach\nScott Gordon\n.\n[\n110\n]\n[\n111\n]\nHe was replaced on an interim basis by\nJack Capuano\n, who had been coaching the Bridgeport Sound Tigers.\n[\n111\n]\n[\n112\n]\nEarly in the season, they also acquired\nMichael Grabner\nfrom waivers, who went on to score 34 goals and was selected as a finalist for the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n;\n[\n113\n]\n[\n114\n]\nhe would go on to sign a five-year contract with the team at the end of the season.\n[\n114\n]\nThis year also featured the\nPenguins\u2013Islanders brawl\n, which resulted in a combined 346 penalty minutes and a $100,000 fine to the Islanders for \"failure to control their players\".\nJohn Tavares\n, was named an alternate captain for the\n2011\u201312 season\n. He was later named the team captain in 2013.\nThe\nfollowing season\nwas a breakout year for Tavares. The newly named assistant captain gained 31 goals and 50 assists,\n[\n115\n]\nin addition to being selected to play in the\n59th NHL All-Star Game\nat the age of 21;\n[\n116\n]\nhis 81 points were seventh-best in the league.\n[\n117\n]\nTavares' left-winger\nMatt Moulson\nalso had a strong season, finishing with career highs of 36 goals, 33 assists and 69 points.\n[\n118\n]\nDespite strong seasons from their top players, the team finished 27th in the league with a record of 34\u201337\u201311, continuing their pattern of racking up top prospects with early picks at the drafts.\n[\n119\n]\nThey used the first round of the\n2012 draft\nto select defenseman\nGriffin Reinhart\nwith the fourth overall pick.\n[\n120\n]\nOn August 1, 2011, voters in\nNassau County\nrejected a proposal for a new arena to replace Nassau Coliseum. This followed the failed decade-long attempt by owner Charles Wang to build a mixed-use development called\nThe Lighthouse Project\n, which would have renovated the arena.\n[\n121\n]\nIn the wake of the vote, speculation began that the team would eventually move to\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\n, new arenas in\nQueens\nor\nSuffolk County\n, the\nSprint Center\nin\nKansas City\n, or the\nVideotron Centre\nin\nQuebec City\n, the last of which was coincidentally set to open at the same time as the expiration of the Islanders' lease on the Nassau Coliseum in 2015.\n[\n122\n]\n[\n123\n]\n[\n124\n]\nOn October 24, 2012, the Islanders made the announcement that the franchise would indeed be moving to the\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\nfor the 2015\u201316 NHL season, after signing a lease that would keep the team in the arena until 2040. The team retained its name, logo and colors as part of the move.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n125\n]\nAs part of the deal, the management of Barclays Center took over the team's business operations once the Islanders moved to Barclays Center.\n[\n126\n]\nThe decision to move to Brooklyn didn't require the Rangers' approval. Under a longstanding provision of the agreement that allowed the Islanders to share the New York area with the Rangers, the Islanders are allowed to play their games anywhere on Long Island, including the two city boroughs on the island, Brooklyn and\nQueens\n.\n[\n127\n]\nBeginning on April 1, 2013, of the\n2012\u201313 season\n, the team went on a near month-long unbeaten streak in regulation time, posting a 12-game streak of earning points until falling to the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nlater that month.\n[\n128\n]\nDuring that streak, on April 23, 2013, they clinched their first playoff berth since 2007 with a 4\u20133 shootout loss to the\nCarolina Hurricanes\n, ending a six-year playoff drought.\n[\n128\n]\n[\n129\n]\nBehind goaltender\nEvgeni Nabokov\n, the team was ultimately eliminated in six games by the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin the first round of the\nplayoffs\n, continuing their winless streak in playoff series.\n[\n130\n]\n[\n131\n]\nOn September 10, 2013, Tavares was introduced as the 14th captain in New York Islanders history, replacing former Islander Mark Streit of the Philadelphia Flyers, who served as team captain since 2011.\n[\n132\n]\nAfter posting a 4\u20134\u20133 record in their first 11 games, the Islanders made a trade, sending fan favorite and three-time 30-goal scorer Matt Moulson, their 2014 first-round draft pick and their 2015 second-round draft pick to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin exchange for\nThomas Vanek\n, a highly regarded and dynamic goal scorer.\n[\n133\n]\n[\n134\n]\nDespite chemistry with linemates Tavares and\nKyle Okposo\n, however, his desire to test free agency and the team's impending move to\nBarclays Center\n[\n135\n]\nled to Vanek being dealt to the\nMontreal Canadiens\nat the trade deadline for\nSebastian Collberg\nand a second-round pick in\n2014\n.\n[\n136\n]\n[\n137\n]\nAfter a season of player swapping and goaltending issues, they failed to qualify for the\nplayoffs\n, finishing with a record of 34\u201337\u201311.\n[\n138\n]\nThe Islanders acquired\nNick Leddy\nthrough a trade with the\nChicago Blackhawks\nduring the 2014 off-season.\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Islanders made several moves to improve the team before their\nfinal season\nat Nassau Coliseum. In May, the Islanders acquired the rights to\nJaroslav Halak\nfrom the\nWashington Capitals\nin exchange for a fourth-round pick in 2014. Halak was then signed to a four-year contract. The Islanders also signed\nMikhail Grabovski\n,\nNikolai Kulemin\nand goaltender\nChad Johnson\nas free agents. Additionally, on October 4, the Islanders acquired\nJohnny Boychuk\nfrom the\nBoston Bruins\nfor two-second round picks in 2014 and\n2015\nand a conditional third-round pick in 2015, as well as\nNick Leddy\nfrom the\nChicago Blackhawks\nin exchange for prospect\nVille Pokka\n,\nT. J. Brennan\nand the rights to\nAnders Nilsson\n.\nThe NHL Board of Governors approved the Islanders' sale to businessmen\nJon Ledecky\nand\nScott D. Malkin\nin October 2014. Ledecky and Malkin served as minority partners during a two-year transition period. At the end of the 2015\u201316 season, they formally took majority control from Wang, who retained a share of the franchise.\n[\n139\n]\nThe Islanders finished the 2014\u201315 regular season with a record of 47\u201328\u20137 for 101 points, and met the Washington Capitals in the first round of the\n2015 playoffs\n. The Capitals held home-ice advantage in the series after the Islanders lost their final regular season game to the\nColumbus Blue Jackets\n, 5\u20134, in a shootout, as the Islanders lost the season series to the Capitals after posting a 2\u20131\u20131 record in the season series (Washington went 2\u20130\u20132, winning the season series with six points to the Islanders' five). On April 19, 2015, in the third game of their first-round series against Washington, John Tavares scored 15 seconds into overtime to win the game for the Islanders, 2\u20131. It was the second-shortest overtime playoff game in Islanders history, and was the first overtime, game-winning goal for the Islanders in the playoffs since 1993. The Islanders lost the fourth and fifth games of their series before rebounding in the sixth game to force a seventh game in the series. However, they were denied entry into the second round by a single goal and would ultimately fall to the Capitals in seven games. As a result, game 6 was the Islanders' last game at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum; the Isles'\nCal Clutterbuck\nscored the final NHL goal in the building's first run prior to the Islanders' return in 2018.\nMove to Barclays Center and playoff series win (2015\u20132017)\n[\nedit\n]\nIn June 2015, the Islanders entered the\n2015 draft\nwithout a first-round pick, but emerged with two first-rounders in\nMathew Barzal\nand\nAnthony Beauvillier\nafter a series of draft day trades.\n[\n140\n]\nThe Islanders also selected forward\nAndong Song\nin the sixth round of the 2015 draft, making him the first Chinese player to be drafted by an NHL team.\n[\n141\n]\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\n. The Islanders played their home games there from 2015 to 2020.\nThe Islanders played their first regular season game at\nBarclays Center\non October 9, 2015, losing 3\u20132 in overtime to the\nChicago Blackhawks\n.\nArtem Anisimov\nscored the first regular season goal, while Tavares scored the first regular season Islanders goal. The Islanders posted the fourth-best penalty kill rate and allowed the fewest power-play goals during the season. However, in the last quarter of the regular season, some players, including Halak and defenseman\nTravis Hamonic\n, suffered key injuries. The team finished the regular season fourth in the Metropolitan Division with 100 points, enough to clinch the first wild card spot in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced off against the\nFlorida Panthers\n; goaltender\nThomas Greiss\nonly played in 40 minutes of playoff hockey with the\nSan Jose Sharks\nprior to this series. Both teams split the first four games of the series. The fifth game of the series proved to be a major turning point, as late season call-up\nAlan Quine\nscored the game-winning goal on the power play with four minutes left in double overtime to end the second-longest game in franchise history; that goal gave them a 3\u20132 series lead and a chance to clinch the series on home ice. In the sixth game, the Islanders trailed 1\u20130 for much of the game, but Tavares tied it late in the third period. Tavares would score again with the series-clinching goal in double overtime to give the Islanders their first playoff series win since 1993. In the second round of the playoffs, they faced the Tampa Bay Lightning for the first time since 2004. Despite winning the first game of the series, the Islanders lost their series to the Lightning in five games.\nAndrew Ladd\nprior to a game during the\n2016\u201317 season\n. Ladd signed with the Islanders as a free agent during the 2016 off-season.\nSummer of 2016 saw free agents and longtime Islanders Kyle Okposo, Frans Nielsen, and Matt Martin all depart the team, joining the\nBuffalo Sabres\n,\nDetroit Red Wings\n, and\nToronto Maple Leafs\n, respectively. Snow signed free agents\nAndrew Ladd\nfrom the\nChicago Blackhawks\nand\nJason Chimera\nfrom the\nWashington Capitals\nto help fill the gaps left behind.\n[\n142\n]\nAfter an underwhelming first half of the\n2016\u201317 season\n, posting a 17\u201317\u20138 record through 42 games, head coach Jack Capuano was relieved of duties, with assistant general manager\nDoug Weight\nbeing named interim head coach.\n[\n143\n]\nHaving coached the team since 2010, Capuano was the second-winningest coach in the team's history with 227 wins, also leading the team to their first playoff series win since 1993.\n[\n144\n]\nPrior to Capuano's release, goaltender Jaroslav Halak was placed on waivers, and eventually sent down to the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. Having carried three goaltenders for the second consecutive season, the decision was made to stick with the tandem of Greiss and back-up\nJean-Francois Berube\nafter Halak posted a 6\u20138\u20135 record with a .904 save percentage through the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season.\n[\n145\n]\nIn late January 2017, following a report by\nBloomberg News\nwhich speculated that Barclays Center was considering removing the Islanders due to poor attendance and effects on the venue's profit margins (reception to Barclays Center as a hockey venue was mixed partly due to obstructed view seats,\n[\n146\n]\nas well as features like an off-center scoreboard, and the Islanders had the third-worst average attendance in the entire league while playing at the venue),\nNewsday\nreported that Nassau County executive Edward Mangano had met with one of the team's co-owners, and told the paper that it was possible that the Islanders could return to the renovated Nassau Coliseum.\n[\n147\n]\n[\n148\n]\nHowever, commissioner\nGary Bettman\nconsidered the concept to be \"unviable\" (the renovation reduced the capacity of the arena to just under 14,000, which is smaller than any NHL arena), and noted that Ledecky and Malkin were pursuing a possible arena project at\nBelmont Park\n.\n[\n149\n]\nDespite winning their last six games of the 2016\u201317 season, the Islanders finished in ninth place in the Eastern Conference; they missed the playoffs by only one point when the Toronto Maple Leafs clinched the final playoff spot on the penultimate day of the season.\nEmergence of Barzal and management overhaul (2017\u2013present)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn February 9, 2018, rookie\nMathew Barzal\nrecorded his third five-point game, becoming only the second rookie to do so since\nJoe Malone\nin 1917\u201318 and tying a 100-year-old record in the process.\n[\n150\n]\nAt the end of the 2017\u201318 regular season, Barzal had 85 points (22 goals, 63 assists). He led his team and all NHL rookies in points, and was tied for 13th overall in scoring in the NHL. Barzal was the seventh rookie in NHL history, and first since\nSidney Crosby\nin 2005\u201306, to have scored at least 20 goals and 60 assists in a single season.\n[\n151\n]\nBarzal also tied Islanders legend,\nBryan Trottier\n's franchise record for rookie assists.\n[\n152\n]\nBarzal won the Calder Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year for his 85-point season, leading the closest candidate by 20 points and receiving 160 out of 164 first-place votes. Barzal was the first Islanders' player to win the award since\nBryan Berard\nin 1997, and he was the fifth Islanders' player overall to win the trophy, joining Islanders legends\nMike Bossy\n(1978), Trottier (1976), and\nDenis Potvin\n(1974).\n[\n151\n]\nIslanders players after a win against the\nColorado Avalanche\non January 6, 2020\nDuring the 2018 off-season, the Islanders announced that former\nNew Jersey Devils\nand\nToronto Maple Leafs\ngeneral manager\nLou Lamoriello\nwas named their president of hockey operations, with \"full authority over all hockey matters with the organization\", and would become general manager on June 5, 2018, replacing\nGarth Snow\n.\n[\n153\n]\n[\n154\n]\nAdditionally,\nBarry Trotz\nwas hired as head coach of the Islanders.

Then, after blowing a 3\u20131 series lead to the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nthat extended the series to seven games, the Islanders would go on to win game 7 against the Flyers and advance to the conference finals for the first time since the\n1993 playoffs\n. However, their run would come to an end at the hands of the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nin six games. In December 2020, New York Islanders Hockey Club, L.P. bought the remaining 15 percent stake of the team from the\nestate of Charles Wang\nand took full ownership of the team.\n[\n169\n]\n[\n170\n]\n[\n171\n]\nThe Islanders again made the playoffs in the shortened 2020\u201321 season, defeating the Penguins and Bruins each in six games.

The lower part of the Y is made to resemble a hockey stick, with three orange stripes near the bottom of the shaft and a puck to the right of the stick blade. At the bottom of the logo, the name of the team is written so that the tip of the \"I\" ends in a point aimed at\nUniondale\n, the location of Nassau Coliseum.\nBefore the\n1995\u201396 season\n, the Islanders attempted to update their look by introducing a new logo depicting a fisherman holding a hockey stick. The new logo was a marketing disaster; the reaction among the fanbase was so negative that management announced it would revert to the original logo as soon as league rules allowed them to do so. Many found that the logo bore a strong resemblance to the\nGorton's fisherman\n; indeed,\nNew York Rangers\nfans taunted the Islanders with chants of \"We want\nfishsticks\n!\" long after the logo was discarded.\n[\n184\n]\nThe traditional logo was phased back in over the next two seasons, starting as an\nalternate jersey\nlogo in\n1996\u201397\nbefore fully replacing the fisherman in\n1997\u201398\n. The only change to the classic logo at this time was its colors; as the team had replaced its original royal blue with navy, the logo was recolored to match.\nThe short-lived \"Fisherman\" logo, used from 1995 to 1997\nBeginning in\n2008\u201309\n, the Islanders introduced another modification to their original logo for their new third jersey. The \"new\" logo, once again in royal blue, now features four orange stripes on the hockey stick instead of three, representing the four consecutive Stanley Cup titles won by the team in the 1980s. This became the team's full-time logo in 2010.\nFor their\n2014 Stadium Series\nspecial jerseys, the Islanders used a simplified jersey logo with just the \"NY\" from their regular logo. Versions of that have since appeared on third jersey designs.\nJerseys\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders debuted in 1972 with traditional-style jerseys: one was white with orange and royal blue stripes near the waistline and on the sleeves, the other was royal blue with white and orange stripes. The design remained largely the same, with only minor tweaks through the\n1994\u201395 season\n.\nPrior to the\n1995\u201396 season\n, team executives decided to change the jersey. The fisherman logo replaced the \"NY\" circular design, incorporating navy blue and a brighter orange, and introducing teal and gray shades. The team was seeking increased merchandise revenues, with the outward justification of connecting the team more overtly to Long Island. The jersey included a lighthouse shoulder patch, a reference to the\nMontauk Lighthouse\n, and featured uneven stripes resembling an ocean wave near the waistline, on the sleeves, and across the shoulders. All of the numbering and lettering on the jerseys also followed the wave pattern.\n[\n185\n]\nLate in the season, the team eliminated the fisherman logo, but league rules forbade them from switching jersey designs for the\n1996\u201397 season\non only a few months' notice. Instead, they debuted their first\nthird (and fourth) jerseys\n, which were identical to the home and road jerseys worn by the team, except the circular \"NY\" crest, now colored in the navy blue and bright orange shades to match, replaced the fisherman logo. The team wore these jerseys in approximately 15 games during that season and adopted them permanently in the\n1997\u201398 season\n.\nThe shoulder logo used on Islanders jerseys from 1998 through 2010\nPrior to the\n1998\u201399 season\n, the team's jerseys reverted to a traditional design but kept the navy blue and bright orange shades from the jerseys used the previous three seasons. They added a shoulder patch of four bars, alternating in color, to represent the Islanders' four Stanley Cup championships. A predominantly orange third jersey was introduced in\n2002\u201303\n, featuring navy blue yokes and sides that formed sharp points on the sleeves and body. The team wore this jersey through the\n2006\u201307 season\n.\nFor the\n2007\u201308 season\n, the Islanders redesigned their uniforms as all NHL teams changed over to the\nReebok Edge\nsystem. These jerseys resembled the prior design but included uniform numbers on the right chest above the logo. The name plates were also in two colored format: white on orange on the navy blue home jersey and navy blue on orange on the white road jersey. The sleeves on both jerseys were orange, with a wide navy stripe above a thin white stripe at the elbow. The jerseys had a thin stripe tracing around the shoulders, and featured \"retro\" laces at the neck.\nA royal blue throwback design was introduced the following season as a third jersey. Before the\n2010\u201311 season\n, the Islanders made this throwback design their new home jersey. A corresponding new white road jersey was unveiled during the Islanders'\ndraft\nparty at Nassau Coliseum.\n[\n186\n]\nFor the following season, they unveiled an alternate jersey in black with grey on the shoulder yoke. The front of the jersey bore the team name above the player's number in orange with blue and white trim. The Islanders crest was placed on the shoulder yoke. Diagonal side panels, blue trimmed in orange and gray, combined with similar panels on the black pants to form a diamond shape on the sides of each player. These were only used sparing for two seasons, as they proved unpopular.\nDuring the\n2014 Stadium Series\n, the Islanders wore a special edition jersey. The front side featured the \"NY\" from the primary logo in a special chrome treatment, while the back side featured a white nameplate with blue letters for player names, and bigger numbers in white trimmed in orange for visibility purposes. The sleeve numbers were also angled diagonally. The primary Islanders logo would be placed on the left shoulder within the white yoke. This jersey was promoted to an alternate third jersey in the\n2014\u201315 season\n, replacing the black third jersey. During that season, on February 3, 2015, the team wore an updated version of the fisherman jersey for warmups before their game against the\nFlorida Panthers\n.\n[\n187\n]\n[\n188\n]\nThe Islanders retired the Stadium Series third jersey after only one season, replacing it with a new black alternate that was unveiled to coincide with the team's move to Brooklyn. Unlike the previous black alternate, this version featured little blue and orange at all (these colors appear only on the rear collar), while the \"NY\" insignia that was carried over from the Stadium Series jersey was stripped of its chrome accents. The four narrow white stripes on the sleeves symbolize the franchise's four Stanley Cup wins.\nWhen the NHL switched to\nAdidas\nas its uniform provider in 2017, the Islanders kept their primary jerseys mostly intact except for the restoration of the blue trim in the primary logo on the road jersey. As with all NHL teams, the Islanders only wore two jerseys for the 2017\u201318 season, thus retiring the all-black third jerseys.\nThe Islanders released a new blue third jersey for the 2018\u201319 season, featuring an updated \"NY\" insignia (shorter \"Y-stick\" with four orange stripes on the blade), white shoulder yoke (reminiscent of the 2014 Stadium Series alternates), the map of Long Island on the collar, and orange numbers that call back to the jerseys used during the team's inaugural season.\n[\n189\n]\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the Islanders released a special \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform. The uniform resembled their current home jerseys, but used the navy blue and bright orange scheme worn from 1995 to 2010.\n[\n190\n]\nA second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was released in the 2022\u201323 season, using the \"Fisherman\" uniform from 1995 to 1997 but with less teal elements and diagonal orange striping.\n[\n191\n]\nDuring the\n2024 Stadium Series\n, the Islanders wore navy blue jerseys with a thick orange middle stripe. \"ISLES\" in navy blue letters was added within the orange stripe, as are the navy blue numbers.\n[\n192\n]\nThe Islanders reverted to wearing only their primary jerseys after\nFanatics\ntook over as the NHL uniform provider in 2024, even though it kept most aspects of Adidas' template and retained the use of third jerseys.\nMascot and Ice Girls\n[\nedit\n]\nIce Girls at a community event in 2013\nThe Islanders' team mascot is named \"\nSparky the Dragon\n\", who served at one point as cross-promotion with the\nArena Football League\n's\nNew York Dragons\nteam, who also played their home games at Nassau Coliseum. In the mid-1990s, the Islanders had a mascot named \"Nyisles\" whose body style went from round to human-shaped, and facial features vaguely resembled the logo fisherman, excluding its red hair and beard. Nyisles was discontinued toward the end of the\n1997\u201398 season\nwhen the team distributed \"Who kidnapped Nyisles?\" flyers implying the reason for his disappearance was because of another NHL mascot, ultimately revealed to be\nToronto Maple Leafs\nmascot\nCarlton the Bear\n. Nyisles returned as the secondary mascot of the club with a brand new look in December 2022 to coincide with the return of the Fisherman logo on the team's reverse retro uniforms.\n[\n193\n]\nFrom the 2001\u201302 season to the 2014\u201315 season, the Islanders also had an ice crew named the \"Ice Girls\", made up of only women who skated onto the ice during television breaks to clean up the snow that piled up during the game. The Ice Girls were also used for promotional purposes during games and at community events. Starting in the 2015\u201316 season, a co-ed ice crew would replace the Ice Girls.\nSeason-by-season record\n[\nedit\n]\nThis is only a partial list of the last five seasons.

    "evidence": "Madison Square Garden has been one of the most celebrated venues in the world since it first opened its doors in 1879. Known as 'The World’s Most Famous Arena,' and located in the heart of New York City, The Garden seats up to approximately 21,000 fans for entertainment and sporting events. As the home of the New York Knicks, New York Rangers, and Billy Joel’s ongoing sold-out monthly residency run, The Garden has been the site of some of the most memorable events in sports and entertainment history. Madison Square Garden also offers the Madison Square Garden Tour Experience, which gives fans the opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes look. The New York Rangers are a professional ice hockey team based in New York City. The Rangers compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Madison Square Garden, an arena they share with the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). They are one of three NHL franchises located in the New York metropolitan area; the others being the New Jersey Devils and New York Islanders. Founded in 1926 by Tex Rickard, the Rangers are one of the Original Six teams that competed in the NHL before its 1967 expansion, along with the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs. The team attained success early on under the guidance of Lester Patrick, who coached a team containing Frank Boucher, Murray Murdoch, and Bun and Bill Cook to win the Stanley Cup in only their second season. They were the first NHL franchise in the United States to win the trophy, and are still the fastest true expansion team in NHL history to do so. The team won two more Stanley Cups in 1933 and 1940. Following this initial grace period, the franchise struggled between the 1940s and 1960s, wherein playoff appearances and successes were infrequent. The team enjoyed a mini-renaissance in the 1970s, where they made the Stanley Cup Finals twice, losing to the Bruins in 1972 and the Canadiens in 1979. The Rangers subsequently embraced a rebuild for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, which eventually paid dividends in 1994, where the team, led by Mark Messier, Brian Leetch, Adam Graves, and Mike Richter, captured their fourth Stanley Cup. The team was unable to duplicate that success in the years that followed, and entered into another period of mediocrity. They endured a franchise-record seven-year postseason drought from 1998 to 2005 and languished for the majority of the 2000s before enjoying another period of prosperity after the 2004–05 NHL Lockout. After the arrival of goaltender Henrik Lundqvist, the Rangers thrived, missing the playoffs just once between 2006 and 2017. They reached the Stanley Cup Finals in 2014, falling to the Los Angeles Kings in five games.",

The Islanders compete in the\nNational Hockey League\n(NHL) as a member of the\nMetropolitan Division\nin the\nEastern Conference\n. The team plays its home games at\nUBS Arena\n. The Islanders are one of three NHL franchises in the\nNew York metropolitan area\n, along with the\nNew Jersey Devils\nand\nNew York Rangers\n, and their fanbase resides primarily on\nLong Island\n.\nThe team was founded in\n1972\nas part of the NHL's maneuvers to keep a team from rival league\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) out of the newly built\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nin suburban\nUniondale, New York\n. After two years of building up the team's roster, they found almost instant success by securing 14 straight playoff berths starting with their third season. The Islanders won four consecutive\nStanley Cup\nchampionships between\n1980\nand\n1983\n, the eighth of nine\ndynasties\nrecognized by the NHL in its history. Their 19 consecutive playoff series wins between 1980 and 1984 is a feat that remains unparalleled in the history of professional sports. They are the last team in any major professional North American sport to win four consecutive championships, and to date the last NHL team to achieve a\nthree-peat\n.\nFollowing the team's dynasty era, the franchise ran into problems with money, ownership and management, an aging arena, and low attendance. Their woes were reflected on the ice, as the team has not won a division title since\n1987\u201388\n, and went 22 seasons without winning a playoff series prior to the\n2016 playoffs\n. After years of failed attempts to rebuild or replace Nassau Coliseum in suburban Long Island, the Islanders relocated to\nBarclays Center\nin Brooklyn following the\n2014\u201315 season\n.\n[\n4\n]\nIn the\n2018\u201319\nand\n2019\u201320\nseasons, the Islanders split their home games between Barclays Center and Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders played all their home games in the\n2020\u201321 season\nat Nassau Coliseum. Their\nnew arena\nnear\nBelmont Park\nwas opened in 2021.\nTen former members of the Islanders have been inducted into the\nHockey Hall of Fame\n, seven of whom\u2014\nMike Bossy\n,\nClark Gillies\n,\nDenis Potvin\n,\nBilly Smith\n,\nBryan Trottier\n, coach\nAl Arbour\n, and general manager\nBill Torrey\n\u2014were members of all four Cup-winning teams. Post-dynasty players\nPat LaFontaine\n,\nRoberto Luongo\nand\nPierre Turgeon\nwere also inducted.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe NHL heads to Long Island (1972\u20131974)\n[\nedit\n]\nIn fall 1972, the emerging\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) planned to place its New York team, the\nNew York Raiders\n, in\nNassau County\n's brand-new\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\n.\n[\n5\n]\nCounty officials did not consider the WHA a major league and wanted to keep the Raiders out.\n[\n6\n]\nWilliam Shea\n, who had helped bring\nMajor League Baseball\n's\nNew York Mets\nto the area a decade earlier, was enlisted to bring an NHL team to Long Island. Although Shea had previously worked with upstart rival leagues including the aborted\nContinental League\n, the\nAmerican Football League\nand the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n, his ultimate goal in these efforts had always been to try to persuade the established leagues to grant second franchises to New York as had been the case with the Mets (and also with the\nNew York Jets\nand\nNew York Nets\n, as a result of those teams' leagues merging with their established rivals).\nWilliam Shea\nplayed a major role in bringing a hockey team to Long Island.\nIn contrast, Shea decided there was no need to work with the WHA since unlike the initial results of his previous approaches to established leagues in the other major sports, Shea immediately found NHL president\nClarence Campbell\nto be receptive to adding a second team in New York. Nevertheless, the Islanders' bid faced opposition from the\nNew York Rangers\n, who did not want additional competition in the New York area.\n[\n7\n]\nEventually, Campbell and Shea persuaded the Rangers' owners,\nMadison Square Garden\n, to reconsider. Rangers' president\nBill Jennings\nweighed pros and cons. Another local NHL team would be compelled to compensate the Rangers for sharing the New York area. On the other hand, a WHA team would owe the Rangers nothing unless it was included in a potential NHL\u2013WHA merger, a prospect to which both Campbell and Jennings were adamantly opposed. Finally, consenting to the establishment of an NHL franchise in suburban Nassau County would help to ensure the vast majority of the Rangers' fanbase within New York City proper would continue to support the older franchise, and reduced the prospect of a rival league eventually establishing a team and fanbase there. Perhaps remembering the crucial role the Jets had played in ensuring the success of the AFL just a few years earlier as a challenger of the\nNational Football League\n, Jennings decided to help bring a new NHL team to the New York metropolitan area.\n[\n8\n]\nDespite expanding to 14 teams just two years prior, the NHL awarded a\nLong Island\n-based franchise to clothing manufacturer\nRoy Boe\n, owner of the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n's\nNew York Nets\n, on November 8, 1971.\n[\n8\n]\nThe terms included $6\u00a0million ($45.1\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) franchise fee plus a $5\u00a0million ($37.59\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) territorial fee to the Rangers.\n[\n10\n]\nAn expansion franchise was also given to\nAtlanta\n(the\nFlames\n) to keep the schedule balanced and to prevent the WHA from entering the growing market at the newly built\nOmni Coliseum\n.\n[\n7\n]\nThe New York Islanders name was unveiled by the franchise on February 15, 1972, at a\npress conference\nheld across the street from\nRoosevelt Raceway\nat a restaurant owned by\nBurt Bacharach\n.\n[\n11\n]\nMany expected it to use the \"\nLong Island Ducks\n\", after the\nEastern Hockey League\nteam that played from 1959 to 1973.\n[\n12\n]\nThe team was soon nicknamed the \"Isles\" by the local newspapers. The Islanders' arrival effectively doomed the Raiders, who played in Madison Square Garden under difficult lease terms and were forced to move to\nCherry Hill, New Jersey\nin the middle of their second season.\n[\n6\n]\nFormer\nCalifornia Golden Seals\nexecutive vice president\nBill Torrey\nwas named as the team's general manager at the same press conference as the franchise's name unveiling.\n[\n11\n]\nThe Islanders secured veteran forward\nEd Westfall\n, defenseman\nGerry Hart\n, and goaltender\nBilly Smith\nin the\n1972 expansion draft\n, along with\njunior ice hockey\nstars\nBilly Harris\n,\nLorne Henning\n, and\nBobby Nystrom\nin the\n1972 amateur draft\n.\n[\n13\n]\nSoon after the draft,\nPhil Goyette\nwas named as the team's first head coach, however he was fired halfway through the season and replaced with\nEarl Ingarfield\nand assistant coach\nAut Erickson\n.\n[\n14\n]\nUnlike most other expansion teams' general managers, Torrey made few trades for veteran players in the early years, as he was committed to building the team through the draft. Torrey stated, \"I told the owners that we're not going to beat this team next door by taking the castoffs from others teams. We'd have to develop our own stars.\"\n[\n13\n]\nBefore the season began, Westfall was named the team's first captain.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\nBy September 1972, the Islanders were waiting for the Nassau Coliseum to be completed as well as their practice facility \"The Royal Ice Rink\" in\nKings Park\n. The team was forced to practice as late as October 6, the day before their first game, at the Rangers practice rink in\nNew Hyde Park\n.\n[\n17\n]\nThe Islanders' first win came on October 12, 1972, in a 3\u20132 game against the\nLos Angeles Kings\n.\n[\n14\n]\nIn the team's first season, young players such as Smith, Nystrom, and Henning (all of whom would be part of the Islanders dynasty of the early 1980s) were given chances to prove themselves in the NHL. The young and inexperienced expansion team, however, posted a record of 12\u201360\u20136, setting an NHL record for most losses and worst overall record in a season.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n18\n]\nA highlight occurred on January 18, 1973, when they defeated the defending\nStanley Cup\nchampion\nBoston Bruins\n9\u20137.\n[\n14\n]\nFinishing last in the standings that season, they received the right to select first in the\n1973 draft\n.\n[\n18\n]\nOff the ice, the Islanders struggled financially, a situation that was exacerbated by the then-unprecedented $11 million in franchise and territorial fees.\nMontreal Canadiens\n' general manager\nSam Pollock\nwas keen to acquire the Islanders' pick so he could draft French Canadian junior star defenseman\nDenis Potvin\n, who had been touted as \"the next\nBobby Orr\n\" when he was 14 years old. Pollock made several lucrative trade offers including cash to the Islanders, but Torrey turned the Canadiens down and selected Potvin with the first overall pick.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n19\n]\nDuring the off-season, Torrey convinced former\nSt. Louis Blues\ncoach\nAl Arbour\nto come coach the Islanders.\n[\n8\n]\nEven with Arbour as the team's head coach and Potvin, who won the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\nas NHL Rookie of the Year, the team again finished last in the\nEast Division\nduring the\n1973\u201374 season\n, but allowed 100 fewer goals than the previous season. The season included their first win against the Rangers, on October 27, 1973,\n[\n5\n]\nwhich also happened to be the game where Potvin scored his first NHL goal. Although they failed to make the playoffs, their 56 points represented a 26-point improvement from the previous season.\n[\n8\n]\nAscendancy and playoff inability (1974\u20131979)\n[\nedit\n]\nDenis Potvin\nled the Islanders to playoff success in the 1970s and 1980s.\nWith the 4th and 22nd picks in the\n1974 draft\n, the Islanders added young forwards\nClark Gillies\nand\nBryan Trottier\nto continue Torrey's building plan.\n[\n20\n]\nIn the\n1974\u201375 season\n, the Islanders made one of the biggest turnarounds in NHL history. Led by Potvin, forwards Westfall, Harris, Nystrom, Gillies, and goaltenders Smith and\nGlenn \"Chico\" Resch\n, the team earned 88 points, 32 more than the previous season and two more than their first two seasons combined, earning their first playoff berth. They defeated the rival\nNew York Rangers\nin a best-of-3 first-round series as\nJ. P. Parise\nscored just 11 seconds into overtime of the third game.\n[\n8\n]\nIn the next round, down three games to none in a best-of-seven series against the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, the Islanders rallied to win the next four and take the series-winning game 7 on a late third-period goal by Westfall. Only four other major North American professional sports teams have accomplished this feat (the\n1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs\n,\n2004 Boston Red Sox\n, the\n2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers\n, and the\n2013\u201314 Los Angeles Kings\n).\n[\n21\n]\nThey were close but not as lucky in the following round, rallying from another 3\u20130 deficit to force a seventh game against the defending\nStanley Cup\nchampion\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nbefore the Flyers took the decisive seventh game at home and went on to win the Cup again.\n[\n8\n]\nDespite a disappointing playoff finish, Arbour remained complimentary of the team's attitude and maturity, saying \"If I called a practice next week, every one of them would show up.\"\n[\n22\n]\nThe Islanders continued their climb up the standings in\n1975\u201376\n, earning 101 points and the fifth-best record in the league.\n[\n23\n]\nIt was the first 100-point season in Islanders history, in only their fourth year of existence.\n[\n24\n]\nRookie center Trottier finished the season with 95 points and won the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n; his points and assists (63) totals set a new league record for most in each category by a rookie.\n[\n25\n]\nIt would be the first of four consecutive 100-point seasons, including the first two division titles in franchise history.\n[\n24\n]\n[\n26\n]\nDespite the emergence of young star players and regular season success between 1976 and 1979 the Islanders suffered a series of playoff disappointments. In\n1976\nand\n1977 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, the Islanders were knocked out in the semifinals by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the\nMontreal Canadiens\n.\n[\n27\n]\nThe Canadiens posted a 24\u20133 record in the playoffs during those two seasons with all three losses coming at the hands of the Islanders.\n[\n28\n]\nMike Bossy\nwas selected with the 15th overall pick in\n1977\nand became the third Islander to win the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n.\nIn the\n1977 draft\n, Torrey had the 15th overall pick and was deciding between forwards\nMike Bossy\nand\nDwight Foster\n. Bossy was known as an emerging scorer who lacked physicality. Foster was known as a solid\nchecker\nwith marginal offensive ability (despite having led the\nOntario Hockey League\nin scoring). Arbour persuaded Torrey to pick Bossy, arguing it was easier to teach a scorer how to check.\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nIn the\n1977\u201378 season\n, Bossy became the third Islander to win the Calder Trophy, and scored 53 goals that season, a rookie record at the time.\n[\n8\n]\nThe team earned their first Patrick Division and Campbell Conference championships.\n[\n14\n]\nSix players finished the season with 30 goals scored or more, with five of them Islanders draft picks, showing the success of the draft building process.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n31\n]\nThe season ended with a familiar result in the\nplayoffs\n, as the team lost in overtime in game 7 of the quarterfinals against the\nToronto Maple Leafs\n.\n[\n29\n]\nIn\n1978\u201379\n, the team finished with the best record in the NHL, clinching it with three goals in the third period of the season's final game against the Rangers. Trottier won the\nHart Memorial Trophy\nas league MVP and captured the\nArt Ross Trophy\nfor the most points, while sophomore Bossy scored 69 goals, which also led the league. Despite their regular season dominance, the Islanders exited the playoffs with another upset playoff loss, this time to the Rangers in the semifinals. As the team was leaving\nMadison Square Garden\nfollowing their game 6 elimination, Rangers fans rocked and threw objects at the team's bus. Hockey professionals and journalists generally questioned whether the Islanders were capable of winning the important games needed to win a Stanley Cup championship. Islander players would cite fear of repeating the pain of this loss as spurring their later success. After transferring the captaincy to Gillies the season before, Westfall retired and shortly thereafter became a color commentator on the team's telecasts.\nOff the ice, the Islanders were on shaky ground. Boe was losing money on both his franchises, even as the Islanders quickly surged to NHL prominence and the Nets became an ABA power. The Islanders were still far behind on the $10\u00a0million they had paid in startup costs, and the expansion and territorial fees associated with moving the Nets to the\nNational Basketball Association\nthrew Boe's finances into a tailspin. Eventually, Boe was forced to sell both his teams. He readily found a buyer for the Nets, but had less luck finding one for the Islanders. Torrey orchestrated a sale to one of the team's limited partners,\nJohn Pickett\n. In return, Pickett promoted Torrey to team president, though Torrey had already been operating head of the franchise before then. Soon after purchasing the team, Pickett signed a very lucrative\ncable television\ncontract with the fledgling\nSportsChannel\nnetwork as their owner,\nCharles Dolan\n, thought the up-and-coming Islanders would be a perfect centerpiece for his new network. Dolan gave Pickett a long-term guaranteed contract intended not only to keep the team on Long Island, but give area governments an incentive to renew his cable contracts. The Islanders have remained on the network, now known as\nMSG Sportsnet\n, for over four decades.\nThe Dynasty (1979\u20131983)\n[\nedit\n]\nAfter the Islanders' regular season dominance and playoff disappointment in 1979, Arbour decided that he would no longer concern himself too greatly with his team's finish in the regular season. Instead, he focused his team's energy on how they would perform in the playoffs. In\n1980\n, the Islanders dropped below the 100-point mark for the first time in five years, earning only 91 points. However, they finally broke through and won the\nStanley Cup\n.\nBefore the\n1980\nplayoffs, the Islanders acquired\nButch Goring\nfrom the\nLos Angeles Kings\n. Goring's arrival was often called the \"final piece of the puzzle.\"\nBefore the playoffs, Torrey made the difficult decision to trade longtime and popular veterans Billy Harris and defenseman\nDave Lewis\nto the\nLos Angeles Kings\nfor second line center\nButch Goring\n. Goring's arrival is often called the \"final piece of the puzzle\",\n[\n32\n]\na strong two-way player, his presence on the second line ensured that opponents would no longer be able to focus their defensive efforts on the Islanders' first line of Bossy, Trottier and\nClark Gillies\n. Contributions from new teammates, such as wingers\nDuane Sutter\nand\nAnders Kallur\nand\nstay-at-home defensemen\nDave Langevin\n,\nGord Lane\n, and\nKen Morrow\n(the latter fresh off a gold medal win at the\n1980 Olympics\n), also figured prominently in the Islanders' playoff success.\nIn the playoffs, the Islanders defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3\u20131 in the preliminary round, then beat the Boston Bruins 4\u20131 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, the Islanders faced the\nBuffalo Sabres\n, who had finished second overall in the NHL standings. The Islanders won the first two games in Buffalo, including a 2\u20131 victory in game two on\nBob Nystrom\n's goal in double overtime. They went on to win the series in six games and reach the finals for the first time in franchise history, where they would face the NHL's regular season champions, the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, who had gone undefeated for 35 straight games (25\u20130\u201310) during the regular season. In game one in\nPhiladelphia\n, the Islanders won 4\u20133 on\nDenis Potvin\n's power-play goal in overtime. Leading the series 3\u20132, they went home to Long Island for game six. In that game the Islanders blew a 4\u20132 lead in the third period but Nystrom continued his overtime heroics, scoring at 7:11 of the extra frame, on assists by John Tonelli and Lorne Henning, to bring Long Island its first Stanley Cup championship. This was the most recent Stanley Cup-clinching game won in overtime by the home team until the Los Angeles Kings did it in 2014. It was also the Islanders' sixth overtime victory of the playoffs. Bryan Trottier won the\nConn Smythe Trophy\nas the most valuable player in the playoffs. Torrey's strategy of building through the draft turned out very well; nearly all of the major contributors on the 1980 champions were home-grown Islanders or had spent most of their NHL careers in the Islanders organization. The Islanders were the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup with Europeans (\nStefan Persson\nand Kallur) on its roster.\n[\n33\n]\nThe Islanders dominated the next two seasons. Bossy scored\n50 goals in 50 games\nin\n1981\nand the Islanders lost only three playoff games en route to defeating the\nMinnesota North Stars\nin five games to win the Stanley Cup. Goring won the Conn Smythe Trophy. During their semifinals sweep of the Rangers, Islander fans began taunting the Rangers with a chant of \"\n1940!\n\"\u00a0\u2013 referring to the Rangers' last Stanley Cup win in\n1940\n(the Rangers would not win the cup again until\n1994\n). Fans in other NHL cities soon picked up the chant.\n[\n34\n]\nThese four banners hung in\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nand represent the four\nStanley Cup\nchampionships the Islanders won from 1980 through 1983.\nIn\n1981\u201382\n, the Islanders won a then-record 15 straight games en route to a franchise-record 118 points, while\nMike Bossy\nset a scoring record for right-wingers with 147 points in an 80-game schedule. The Islanders finished with the most points in the league (118), yet once in the playoffs against the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nthey found themselves down late in the third period of deciding game 5 before\nJohn Tonelli\nscored both the tying goal and the overtime winner. After defeating the Rangers in six games they swept both the\nQuebec Nordiques\nand the\nVancouver Canucks\nin the first-ever coast-to-coast\nStanley Cup Finals\nfor their third straight championship. During that series Bossy, upended by a check from\nTiger Williams\nand falling parallel to the ice, managed to hook the puck with his stick and score. Bossy netted the Stanley Cup-winning goal and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nThe next year, although the Islanders had won the Stanley Cup three straight times, more attention was being paid to the upstart\nEdmonton Oilers\n, whose young superstar\nWayne Gretzky\nhad just shattered existing scoring records.\n[\n35\n]\nIn\n1982\u201383\nthe Oilers had a better regular season, but the Islanders swept them in the\nStanley Cup Finals\nto win their fourth straight championship.\nBilly Smith\nwas named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner after shutting down the Oilers' vaunted scoring machine. Gretzky failed to score a goal during the series.\n[\n36\n]\nDuane and\nBrent Sutter\nscored seven and five points respectively in the first three games, while Bossy again scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in game four. After that game, the Oilers players walked past the Islanders' dressing room and were surprised to see the champions exhausted. Oilers players such as Gretzky and\nMark Messier\nsaid that they realized at that moment how much it would actually take to win the Stanley Cup.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\nPost-dynasty and the Easter Epic (1983\u20131991)\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders finished the\n1983\u201384 regular season\ntied atop the Prince of Wales Conference while successfully defending their Patrick Division title. The \"Drive for Five\" got off to a tense start. Late in the deciding game of their first-round series against the Rangers,\nDon Maloney\ntied the game with a controversial goal as the Islanders believed Maloney's stick was too high. They ultimately eliminated the Rangers for the fourth consecutive year. The team then defeated the\nWashington Capitals\nin five games and the\nMontreal Canadiens\nin six to set up a finals rematch with the Oilers. The series featured rookie\nPat LaFontaine\nscoring two third-period goals in 38 seconds. This time, the Oilers dethroned the Islanders to win the first of what would be five Stanley Cup victories in seven years. For the\n1984 playoffs\n, the NHL changed the home and away schedule for the finals, which provided the Islanders home-ice advantage in the series based on Wales Conference teams collectively having a winning record in regular season games versus Campbell Conference opponents,\n[\n38\n]\ndespite finishing lower than them in the overall standings. The new format had them play three straight games in Edmonton, where the Oilers managed to lock up the series, after the teams had split the first two games in New York. Bossy cited the team's hard time winning an away game as their downfall in the series.\n[\n39\n]\nThe Oilers also ended the Islanders' 19-series playoff winning streak. It remains the longest streak in the history of professional sports (one more than the 1959\u20131967 streak by the\nBoston Celtics\nof the NBA). Unlike the 1976\u20131979 Montreal Canadiens, who needed to win three series in the 1976 and 1977 playoffs under the playoff format in place at that time, the Islanders had to win four series in each of their Stanley Cup seasons.\nThe Islanders remained competitive for the rest of the decade, even as some of the stars from the Cup teams departed. As the decade wore on, Pickett began to keep the money from the team's cable deal rather than reinvest it in the team as he had done in years past. Although it did not become clear immediately, the lack of funds limited Torrey's ability to replace all of the departing talent. In the\n1984\u201385 NHL season\n, the Islanders slipped to third in their division, followed by similar results in the\n1985\u201386\nand\n1986\u201387\nseasons. They began facing stiff competition from division rivals, the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, who eliminated the Islanders in the division finals in 1985 and 1987, and the Capitals, who swept the Islanders' 1986 first-round series, the team's first exit without winning a playoff round since 1978.\nKelly Hrudey\n(pictured in 2006) saved 73 of 75 shots in the \"\nEaster Epic\n\" for the Islanders, who came out victorious after four periods of overtime play.\nIn 1986, Nystrom retired due to a serious injury\n[\n40\n]\nand\nClark Gillies\nwas picked up on waivers by the\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\n[\n41\n]\nArbour retired as coach following the\n1985\u201386 season\nand was replaced by longtime junior hockey coach\nTerry Simpson\n.\n[\n42\n]\nDuring the first round of the\n1987 playoffs\nagainst the Capitals, the Islanders had fallen behind in the series three games to one but were not eliminated due to a playoff format change from a best-of-5 series to a best-of-7.\n[\n43\n]\nThe Islanders evened the series, which set the stage for one of the most famous games in NHL history: the \"\nEaster Epic\n\".\nKelly Hrudey\nstopped 73 shots on goal while Pat LaFontaine scored at 8:47 of the fourth overtime\u2014and at 1:56\u00a0a.m. on\nEaster Sunday\nmorning. The win came even though the Islanders had been outshot 75\u201352.\n[\n44\n]\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\nThey were eliminated in the division finals in seven games by the Flyers.\n[\n47\n]\nChronic back pain forced\nMike Bossy\nto retire after the season.\n[\n48\n]\nThe\nfollowing season\n, the Islanders captured another division title,\n[\n49\n]\nbut were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the upstart\nNew Jersey Devils\n.\n[\n50\n]\nPotvin retired after the playoffs, holding records for most career goals (310), assists (742) and points (1052) by a defenseman, though he has since been passed in these categories by\nRay Bourque\nand\nPaul Coffey\n. Around this time, the team's run of good luck in the draft began to run out. Of their four top draft picks from 1987 to 1990, they lost one to a freak knee injury and two others never panned out.\n[\n51\n]\nThe\n1988\u201389 season\nsaw the Islanders win only seven of their first 27 games. Torrey fired Simpson and brought Arbour back. Arbour was unable to turn things around, and the team finished with 61 points, tied with the\nQuebec Nordiques\nfor the worst record in the league. It was their first losing season and the first time missing the playoffs since their second season. Smith, the last remaining original Islanders player, retired after the season to become the team's goaltending coach. Not long after the end of the season, Pickett moved to Florida and turned day-to-day operations over to a committee of four Long Island entrepreneurs: Ralph Palleschi, Bob Rosenthal,\nStephen Walsh\n, and\nPaul Greenwood\n. In return, they each bought a 2.5% interest in the team.\n[\n51\n]\nIn the\nnext season\n, the Islanders rebounded to get back into the playoffs, but fell to the Rangers in five games of the opening round. The team bought out the remaining years of\nBryan Trottier\n's contract, sending him off with a team record of games played. The\n1990\u201391 season\nhad the team finish well out of the playoffs after winning only 25 games.\nNew faces and the 1993 run (1991\u20131995)\n[\nedit\n]\nLaFontaine was frustrated with the team's lack of success and the progress of his contract negotiations, and held out rather than report to camp before\n1991\u201392\n. In response to the holdout, Torrey engineered a rebuilding project with two blockbuster trades on October 25, 1991. He dealt LaFontaine,\nRandy Wood\nand\nRandy Hillier\n(along with future considerations) to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin return for\nPierre Turgeon\n,\nBenoit Hogue\n,\nUwe Krupp\nand\nDave McLlwain\n. He also sent longtime captain\nBrent Sutter\nand\nBrad Lauer\nto the\nChicago Blackhawks\nfor\nSteve Thomas\nand\nAdam Creighton\n. With these additions and a talented core of players such as\nDerek King\n,\nRay Ferraro\n, and\nPatrick Flatley\n, along with incoming\nSoviet\nplayers\nVladimir Malakhov\nand\nDarius Kasparaitis\n, the Islanders had a new foundation in the early 1990s. The management committee, however, was not nearly as patient as Boe and Pickett had been, and forced Torrey to resign after the Islanders missed the playoffs again that season. Assistant general manager\nDon Maloney\nwas hired in Torrey's place,\n[\n51\n]\nwhile Torrey quickly resurfaced with the expansion\nFlorida Panthers\n.\nIn Maloney's first year,\n1992\u201393\n, the Islanders rebounded to make the playoffs, in the process surpassing the 80-point mark for the first time in five years. The LaFontaine-Turgeon trade proved successful for both the Islanders and Sabres, as both players hit career highs in points and Turgeon won the\nLady Byng Trophy\n.\nRay Ferraro emerged as a playoff hero, scoring a pair of overtime winners in the first-round series against the Capitals. Instead of celebrating after winning game 6 at Nassau Coliseum, however, the Islanders were both irate and despondent. Only seconds after Turgeon, the team's star center and leading scorer, scored an insurance goal in the series-clinching game,\nDale Hunter\nviolently checked him from behind. Turgeon was believed to be out for the entire second round, if not longer, with a separated shoulder. He returned only for spot power-play duty in the last game of the second round. Hunter received a 21-game suspension, at the time the longest for on-ice misconduct in modern NHL history.\nThe Islanders' next opponent, the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, were twice-defending Stanley Cup champions and full of stars such as\nMario Lemieux\n,\nJaromir Jagr\n, and\nRon Francis\n. The Penguins had roared through the regular season with 119 points, as well as recording a record 17 consecutive wins towards the end of the season, and were overwhelmingly favored to win a third straight championship. Jim Smith of\nNewsday\npredicted that with Turgeon on the sidelines, the Penguins would sweep the Islanders out of the playoffs, however on the strength of outstanding goaltending from\nGlenn Healy\nand contributions from all four lines, the Islanders achieved a huge upset when\nDavid Volek\nscored at 5:16 of overtime of the deciding seventh game.\nNewsday'\ns front page the day following the win was a picture of Healy with a headline reading, \"It's a Miracle!\" This was the last playoff series won by the Islanders for 23 years, until the 2015\u201316 season. Turgeon returned to the Islanders' top line for the conference finals against the\nMontreal Canadiens\n, though he was not in peak form as he had not fully recovered. The Islanders bowed out of the playoffs after a hard-fought five games, two of which went to overtime. After beating the Islanders, the Canadiens went on to win the Cup.\nMaloney had avoided making many personnel changes his first year, but on the eve of the\n1993 expansion draft\nhe traded backup goaltender\nMark Fitzpatrick\nto the\nQuebec Nordiques\nfor\nRon Hextall\n. The clubs also exchanged first-round picks in the deal. Able to protect only one netminder in the expansion draft, the Islanders left Healy exposed. He was claimed by the\nMighty Ducks of Anaheim\n, then was claimed by the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nin Phase II of the draft the next day, and finally had his rights traded to the Rangers, where he became the backup.\nThe Islanders barely squeezed past the Panthers to make the 1994 playoffs before being swept in a lopsided opening series by the first-place Rangers, who went on to win the Cup. It would be the Islanders' last playoff appearance until\n2002\n. Arbour retired for good as coach and was succeeded by longtime assistant\nLorne Henning\n. Hextall, who allowed 16 goals in three games, drew most of the criticism for the failed playoff campaign and was shipped to Philadelphia for\nTommy Soderstrom\nin September. In the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season, the Islanders not only failed to qualify for the playoffs, they finished ahead of only the third-year\nOttawa Senators\n.\nManagement issues (1995\u20132000)\n[\nedit\n]\nBy the end of the 1994\u201395 season, Maloney was under considerable heat from the press and fan base for his handling of the team. Since taking over in 1992, the only noticeable attempt he made to upgrade the roster was the acquisition of Hextall. Near the end of the failed 1995 campaign, Maloney decided that the core of players he had left alone for three seasons needed to be revamped, leading to a rebuilding project. He traded Turgeon and Malakhov to the\nMontreal Canadiens\nfor\nKirk Muller\nand\nMathieu Schneider\n, while Hogue was sent to\nToronto\nfor young goaltender\nEric Fichaud\n. Additionally, Maloney allowed the team's leading scorer, Ferraro, to depart as an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of the season. Fans' displeasure at Maloney for trading the popular Turgeon was magnified when Muller balked at joining a rebuilding team. He played 45 games for the Islanders before being sent to Toronto as well.\nBefore the\n1995\u201396 season\n, Maloney fired Henning and named\nMike Milbury\nhead coach. The same year, the Islanders' attempt at updating their look resulted in the unveiling of a new team logo of a slicker-clad fisherman holding a hockey stick. Islanders fans disliked it, and rival Rangers' fans mockingly called the Islanders \"\nfishsticks\n\"\u2014mocking how the logo resembled the\nGorton's Fisherman\n. The team reverted to a modified version of the old logo as soon as the league allowed them to do so. (In spite of this, the logo found renewed popularity as a throwback design in the late 2010s and early 2020s, enough so that the team would revive it as their third \"Reverse Retro\" jersey in 2022 and would use an adjusted version of the logo for their AHL team, the\nBridgeport Islanders\n, beginning in 2024.) The year was a disappointment on the ice as well, as the Islanders finished in last place with a record of 22\u201350\u201310. During the season, team management fired Maloney, whom fans blamed for the team's downfall,\n[\n52\n]\nand gave Milbury full control of hockey operations as both a coach and general manager. Milbury went on to resign as head coach during the\nfollowing season\nand elevated assistant\nRick Bowness\nto the position. After another unsuccessful season with little improvement, Milbury took over as coach again during the\n1997\u201398 season\n. The team improved to fourth place in their division but again failed to make the playoffs. Milbury followed by once again stepping down as coach during the\nfollowing season\nwhile retaining his job as general manager.\nDuring the continued playoff drought, instability in the front office mirrored the Islanders' substandard performance on the ice. Pickett sold the team to\nDallas\nbusinessman\nJohn Spano\nin 1996. However, three months after the 1997 closing, Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of the first installment on the cable rights deal. Several Islanders executives tipped off\nNewsday\nthat something was amiss about their new boss.\n[\n53\n]\nIn July,\nNewsday\nexposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required to complete the deal. The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth, and also had two lawsuits pending against him. Within days of the report, Spano was forced to relinquish the team to Pickett. Federal prosecutors turned up evidence that Spano had forged many of the documents used to vouch for his wealth and to promise payment to Pickett, and even appeared to have sent many of the documents from his own office in Dallas. He was sentenced to 71 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. The NHL took additional heat when reports surfaced that the league spent well under $1,000 (depending on the source, the league spent either $525\n[\n53\n]\nor $750\n[\n51\n]\n) to check Spano's background. It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners. The incident and its aftermath were covered in the\nESPN\n30 for 30\ndocumentary,\nBig Shot\n.\n[\n54\n]\nPickett finally found a buyer, a group led by\nHoward Milstein\nand\nPhoenix Coyotes\nco-owner Steven Gluckstern, a deal which almost fell through when\nSpectacor Management Group\n, which managed the Coliseum for Nassau County, tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was safe. Pickett refused, since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in recent seasons. SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders, the NHL, and Nassau County officials.\nInitially, the team made numerous trades and increased their payroll in an effort to assemble a better team. In one transaction, young players\nTodd Bertuzzi\nand\nBryan McCabe\nwere traded for veteran\nTrevor Linden\n. After the Islanders finished 12 points short of the playoffs in the 1997\u201398 season, however, Milstein and Gluckstern decided to run the team on an austere budget in an attempt to make a profit. They also complained about the condition of the Nassau Coliseum and made noises about moving the team elsewhere. They began trading or releasing many popular players to avoid paying their salaries, including star scorer\nZigmund Palffy\n, team captain Linden, former rookie of the year\nBryan Berard\n, and rugged defenseman\nRich Pilon\n. Losing the highly regarded players, the team finished with similar results the next two seasons. Attendance, which had been in a steady decline over the past few years, decreased even further to under 12,000 per game. Around that time, Milstein bid hundreds of millions of dollars in unsuccessful attempts to purchase the\nNational Football League\n's\nWashington Redskins\nand\nCleveland Browns\n.\nNew ownership and a return to the playoffs (2000\u20132006)\n[\nedit\n]\nLet's face it, the Coliseum is a dump, and the team, well, they're losers. It's a real shame. We want to see it change because this is our home. We all deserve better.\n\u2014\nCharles Wang\n[\n55\n]\nIn 2000, Milstein and Gluckstern sold the team to\nComputer Associates\nexecutives\nCharles Wang\nand\nSanjay Kumar\n. The sale cost $187.5\u00a0million ($342.36\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) and gave fans hope for the team to turn its lack of success around.\n[\n55\n]\nThe new owners allowed Milbury to spend money and invest in free agents. His first attempt proved unpopular with fans, as he traded away future star players\nRoberto Luongo\nand\nOlli Jokinen\nto the\nFlorida Panthers\nfor\nOleg Kvasha\nand\nMark Parrish\n. Milbury then further surprised the hockey world when he took\nRick DiPietro\nwith the first selection in the\n2000 draft\n, ahead of consensus picks\nDany Heatley\nand\nMarian Gaborik\n. Reporters and fans were alternately confused and enraged by the moves, which Milbury acknowledged, saying, \"As dangerous as this may be, we think Mad Mike maybe has something going for him.\"\n[\n56\n]\nEstablishing a record of controversial decisions, Milbury held onto the \"Mad Mike\" nickname for years to follow. He remained adamant that his moves were to immediately improve the team, whose poor winning percentage that year was ahead of only the franchise's first season.\n[\n57\n]\nThe team's uninspired play led Milbury to fire head coach and past player\nButch Goring\n. Fans vocalized their dislike of Goring taking the fall rather than Milbury, which was further worsened when Milbury passed on hiring\nTed Nolan\nas Goring's successor; Instead,\nBoston Bruins\nassistant coach\nPeter Laviolette\nwas hired.\n[\n58\n]\nThe Islanders acquired\nAlexei Yashin\n(left) prior to the\n2001\u201302 season\n. Yashin would go on to become the team's captain in later years.\nThree key personnel acquisitions were made prior to the 2001\u201302 season, Laviolette's first.\nAlexei Yashin\nwas acquired from the\nOttawa Senators\nin exchange for forward\nBill Muckalt\n, defenseman\nZdeno Chara\nand the Islanders' second overall pick in the\n2001 draft\n. Next, Islanders prospects\nTim Connolly\nand\nTaylor Pyatt\nwere traded to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin exchange for\nMichael Peca\n, who became the team's captain.\n[\n59\n]\n[\n60\n]\nBy virtue of finishing with the worst record in the previous season,\nDetroit Red Wings\ngoaltender\nChris Osgood\nwas the next addition, taken as the first pick in the September 2001 waiver draft, adding a former Stanley Cup championship goaltender without giving up any players in exchange.\n[\n61\n]\nThe additions proved to be a great help, as the team opened the season with a 9\u20130\u20131\u20131 record, the best in franchise history. They finished the season with new broken records; their 96 points marked the fourth biggest one-year turnaround in the league's history (44 points higher than the previous season), while Osgood's 66 starts surpassed\nRon Hextall\n's previous record of 65.\n[\n22\n]\nDuring the\n2002 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, they were seeded fifth and faced the fourth-seeded\nToronto Maple Leafs\n. The Islanders lost in a very physical first-round series in seven games; the home team won every game of the series. Notably, game 5 featured\nGary Roberts\ncharging Islander defenseman\nKenny Jonsson\n, and\nDarcy Tucker\nsubmarining Peca with a questionable check that tore the Islander captain's\nanterior cruciate ligament\n, sidelining both players for the series' final game. The situation between Tucker and Peca caused a bit of outrage, with speculation that Tucker had intended to injure Peca before the game had begun, which Tucker denied.\n[\n62\n]\nDespite the promise shown in the Toronto playoff series, the Islanders had a slow start to the\n2002\u201303 season\n. They rebounded to make the playoffs, but lost a five-game series in the first round to the top-seeded\nOttawa Senators\n.\n[\n63\n]\nMilbury continued his controversial move-making by firing Laviolette after the season, citing postseason interviews with the players in which they expressed a lack of confidence in the coach.\n[\n64\n]\nHe was replaced with\nSteve Stirling\n, who had previously been coaching the team's top minor league affiliate, the\nBridgeport Sound Tigers\n. In the\nfollowing season\n, the Islanders again lost in the first round of the playoffs, this time to the eventual champion\nTampa Bay Lightning\n.\n[\n65\n]\nFollowing the\n2004\u201305 NHL lockout\n, which eliminated that season of play, the Islanders made several player moves to increase offense for\nfollowing season\n. Peca was traded to the\nEdmonton Oilers\nfor center\nMike York\n, freeing up room under the NHL's new salary cap.\n[\n66\n]\nThe same day, the team signed winger\nMiroslav Satan\nto play alongside Yashin.\n[\n67\n]\nMilbury also worked on remaking the team's defense, adding\nAlexei Zhitnik\n,\nBrad Lukowich\nand\nBrent Sopel\nto replace the departed\nAdrian Aucoin\nand\nRoman Hamrlik\n, who left as free agents, and Jonsson, who left the NHL to play in the\nHockeyAllsvenskan\nin Sweden.\n[\n68\n]\nIn the aftermath, Yashin was named as the team's new captain.\n[\n69\n]\nThe team's inconsistent play led to Stirling's dismissal midway through the season.\n[\n14\n]\nManagement shake-ups and the DiPietro contract (2006\u20132009)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn the day of Stirling's firing, January 11, 2006, Milbury also announced that he would step down as general manager once a successor was found.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n70\n]\nHe served as vice president of Wang's sports properties for one year before resigning in May 2007.\n[\n71\n]\nWang proceeded by hiring\nNeil Smith\nas general manager and\nTed Nolan\nas head coach, following a brief stint by\nBrad Shaw\nas the team's interim head coach.\n[\n72\n]\n[\n73\n]\nSmith, however, was fired after approximately one month and quickly replaced by the team's backup goaltender\nGarth Snow\n, who retired from his playing career to accept the position.\n[\n22\n]\nBefore his dismissal, Smith made several free agent acquisitions, including defensemen\nBrendan Witt\nand\nTom Poti\n, and forwards\nMike Sillinger\nand\nChris Simon\n.\n[\n72\n]\nOn September 12, 2006, the Islanders signed DiPietro to a 15-year, $67.5\u00a0million ($105.28\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) contract, which was believed to be the longest contract to date in the NHL and the second-longest in North American sports, behind a 25-year contract for\nNational Basketball Association\nplayer\nMagic Johnson\n.\n[\n74\n]\n[\n75\n]\nDiPietro, Wang and Snow all spoke confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides, despite the mixed reactions it received from the rest of the hockey world. Specifically, Wang stated, \"This is not a big deal. You have to have a commitment to who you're working with.\"\n[\n74\n]\nAs speculation began as to whether other teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players,\nAtlanta Thrashers\n' general manager\nDon Waddell\nfelt that, \"It's highly unlikely that you will see teams go beyond that. This is a once-in-a-lifetime contract. Ownership must feel very strongly that he's their guy for the next 15 years.\"\n[\n75\n]\nBill Guerin\nwas the team captain from 2007 to 2009.\nThe new-look Islanders were picked by most analysts to languish towards the bottom of the standings.\n[\n76\n]\nEyeing a playoff spot, Snow traded for forward\nRyan Smyth\nfrom the\nEdmonton Oilers\nat the trade deadline on February 27, 2007.\n[\n77\n]\nInjuries to DiPietro provided extra setbacks, but not enough to drop the team from playoff contention.\n[\n78\n]\n[\n79\n]\nThey qualified for the playoffs, assisted by a late-season winning streak and a 3\u20132 shootout victory against the\nNew Jersey Devils\nin their final regular season game.\n[\n80\n]\nDespite DiPietro's return to the team in time for the playoffs, the team lost their first round matchup in five games to the\nPresidents' Trophy\n-winning\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\n[\n81\n]\nManagement announced in June 2007 that they would buy out captain\nAlexei Yashin\n's contract, which had four seasons remaining on it.\n[\n82\n]\nFree agents Smyth, Poti,\nViktor Kozlov\n,\nJason Blake\n, and\nRichard Zednik\nalso left in July 2007.\n[\n83\n]\n[\n84\n]\nDuring that month, the Islanders signed\nBill Guerin\nto a two-year contract as he immediately assumed team captaincy.\n[\n83\n]\nAlso in the off-season, free agents\nMike Comrie\n,\nAndy Sutton\nand\nJon Sim\njoined the team.\n[\n85\n]\n[\n86\n]\nThat summer, it was announced that Nolan extended an invitation to Al Arbour to return as a coach for one game in order to bring his total number of games coached to 1,500.\n[\n87\n]\n[\n88\n]\nArbour signed a one-day contract, the shortest in league history, on November 3, 2007; it put him behind the bench the following day as the Islanders defeated the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n3\u20132, raising his career coaching win total to 740.\n[\n89\n]\nThe team remained in the playoff hunt through the trade deadline as they re-signed Comrie to a one-year contract and traded away Simon and\nMarc-Andre Bergeron\n.\n[\n90\n]\nA rash of injuries saw them plummet to the fifth-worst record in the league by the end of the season.\n[\n91\n]\nJosh Bailey\nwas drafted by the Islanders in 2008, to provide depth at the wing for the team.\nAt the\n2008 NHL entry draft\n, the Islanders made two trades to move down from the fifth to the ninth overall pick, with which they selected center\nJosh Bailey\n. They also added free agents\nMark Streit\nand\nDoug Weight\n. The team dismissed head coach\nTed Nolan\nover alleged philosophy differences,\n[\n92\n]\n[\n93\n]\nand later that summer replaced him with\nScott Gordon\n.\n[\n94\n]\nNear the trade deadline, Snow traded Comrie and\nChris Campoli\nto the\nOttawa Senators\nin exchange for forward\nDean McAmmond\nand the\nSan Jose Sharks\n' first-round draft pick in the\n2009 NHL entry draft\nand sent captain Bill Guerin to the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin exchange for a conditional draft pick.\n[\n95\n]\n[\n96\n]\nIn the\n2008\u201309 season\n, the Islanders finished in last place in the league with a record of 26\u201347\u20139, which was the team's worst record since the 2000\u201301 season. After the conclusion of regular season, they won the draft lottery to retain the first overall pick in the\n2009 NHL entry draft\n.\n[\n97\n]\nThe Tavares era begins (2009\u20132015)\n[\nedit\n]\nBeginning an effort to rebuild the team with new and young talent, the Islanders selected\nJohn Tavares\nwith the first-overall pick of the\n2009 NHL entry draft\n.\n[\n98\n]\nTavares went into the draft as the top prospect in the majority of scouting reports,\n[\n99\n]\nand it was widely expected that the Islanders would select him after they secured the first overall pick by winning the draft lottery, although there was plenty of competition between Tavares,\nVictor Hedman\n, and\nMatt Duchene\n.\n[\n100\n]\nNHL Central Scouting Bureau\n's Chris Edwards spoke highly of him, stating, \"[Tavares] is phenomenal at getting the puck through traffic to his linemates, getting to opening.

Continuing with their rebuilding process, they used the first round to draft young forwards\nNino Niederreiter\nand\nBrock Nelson\nwith picks five and 30, respectively.\n[\n109\n]\nAs the\n2010\u201311 season\ngot underway, the team quickly fell into a ten-game losing streak, leading to the firing of head coach\nScott Gordon\n.\n[\n110\n]\n[\n111\n]\nHe was replaced on an interim basis by\nJack Capuano\n, who had been coaching the Bridgeport Sound Tigers.\n[\n111\n]\n[\n112\n]\nEarly in the season, they also acquired\nMichael Grabner\nfrom waivers, who went on to score 34 goals and was selected as a finalist for the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n;\n[\n113\n]\n[\n114\n]\nhe would go on to sign a five-year contract with the team at the end of the season.\n[\n114\n]\nThis year also featured the\nPenguins\u2013Islanders brawl\n, which resulted in a combined 346 penalty minutes and a $100,000 fine to the Islanders for \"failure to control their players\".\nJohn Tavares\n, was named an alternate captain for the\n2011\u201312 season\n. He was later named the team captain in 2013.\nThe\nfollowing season\nwas a breakout year for Tavares.

This followed the failed decade-long attempt by owner Charles Wang to build a mixed-use development called\nThe Lighthouse Project\n, which would have renovated the arena.\n[\n121\n]\nIn the wake of the vote, speculation began that the team would eventually move to\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\n, new arenas in\nQueens\nor\nSuffolk County\n, the\nSprint Center\nin\nKansas City\n, or the\nVideotron Centre\nin\nQuebec City\n, the last of which was coincidentally set to open at the same time as the expiration of the Islanders' lease on the Nassau Coliseum in 2015.\n[\n122\n]\n[\n123\n]\n[\n124\n]\nOn October 24, 2012, the Islanders made the announcement that the franchise would indeed be moving to the\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\nfor the 2015\u201316 NHL season, after signing a lease that would keep the team in the arena until 2040. The team retained its name, logo and colors as part of the move.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n125\n]\nAs part of the deal, the management of Barclays Center took over the team's business operations once the Islanders moved to Barclays Center.\n[\n126\n]\nThe decision to move to Brooklyn didn't require the Rangers' approval. Under a longstanding provision of the agreement that allowed the Islanders to share the New York area with the Rangers, the Islanders are allowed to play their games anywhere on Long Island, including the two city boroughs on the island, Brooklyn and\nQueens\n.\n[\n127\n]\nBeginning on April 1, 2013, of the\n2012\u201313 season\n, the team went on a near month-long unbeaten streak in regulation time, posting a 12-game streak of earning points until falling to the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nlater that month.\n[\n128\n]\nDuring that streak, on April 23, 2013, they clinched their first playoff berth since 2007 with a 4\u20133 shootout loss to the\nCarolina Hurricanes\n, ending a six-year playoff drought.\n[\n128\n]\n[\n129\n]\nBehind goaltender\nEvgeni Nabokov\n, the team was ultimately eliminated in six games by the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin the first round of the\nplayoffs\n, continuing their winless streak in playoff series.\n[\n130\n]\n[\n131\n]\nOn September 10, 2013, Tavares was introduced as the 14th captain in New York Islanders history, replacing former Islander Mark Streit of the Philadelphia Flyers, who served as team captain since 2011.\n[\n132\n]\nAfter posting a 4\u20134\u20133 record in their first 11 games, the Islanders made a trade, sending fan favorite and three-time 30-goal scorer Matt Moulson, their 2014 first-round draft pick and their 2015 second-round draft pick to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin exchange for\nThomas Vanek\n, a highly regarded and dynamic goal scorer.\n[\n133\n]\n[\n134\n]\nDespite chemistry with linemates Tavares and\nKyle Okposo\n, however, his desire to test free agency and the team's impending move to\nBarclays Center\n[\n135\n]\nled to Vanek being dealt to the\nMontreal Canadiens\nat the trade deadline for\nSebastian Collberg\nand a second-round pick in\n2014\n.\n[\n136\n]\n[\n137\n]\nAfter a season of player swapping and goaltending issues, they failed to qualify for the\nplayoffs\n, finishing with a record of 34\u201337\u201311.\n[\n138\n]\nThe Islanders acquired\nNick Leddy\nthrough a trade with the\nChicago Blackhawks\nduring the 2014 off-season.\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Islanders made several moves to improve the team before their\nfinal season\nat Nassau Coliseum. In May, the Islanders acquired the rights to\nJaroslav Halak\nfrom the\nWashington Capitals\nin exchange for a fourth-round pick in 2014. Halak was then signed to a four-year contract. The Islanders also signed\nMikhail Grabovski\n,\nNikolai Kulemin\nand goaltender\nChad Johnson\nas free agents. Additionally, on October 4, the Islanders acquired\nJohnny Boychuk\nfrom the\nBoston Bruins\nfor two-second round picks in 2014 and\n2015\nand a conditional third-round pick in 2015, as well as\nNick Leddy\nfrom the\nChicago Blackhawks\nin exchange for prospect\nVille Pokka\n,\nT. J. Brennan\nand the rights to\nAnders Nilsson\n.\nThe NHL Board of Governors approved the Islanders' sale to businessmen\nJon Ledecky\nand\nScott D. Malkin\nin October 2014. Ledecky and Malkin served as minority partners during a two-year transition period. At the end of the 2015\u201316 season, they formally took majority control from Wang, who retained a share of the franchise.\n[\n139\n]\nThe Islanders finished the 2014\u201315 regular season with a record of 47\u201328\u20137 for 101 points, and met the Washington Capitals in the first round of the\n2015 playoffs\n. The Capitals held home-ice advantage in the series after the Islanders lost their final regular season game to the\nColumbus Blue Jackets\n, 5\u20134, in a shootout, as the Islanders lost the season series to the Capitals after posting a 2\u20131\u20131 record in the season series (Washington went 2\u20130\u20132, winning the season series with six points to the Islanders' five). On April 19, 2015, in the third game of their first-round series against Washington, John Tavares scored 15 seconds into overtime to win the game for the Islanders, 2\u20131. It was the second-shortest overtime playoff game in Islanders history, and was the first overtime, game-winning goal for the Islanders in the playoffs since 1993. The Islanders lost the fourth and fifth games of their series before rebounding in the sixth game to force a seventh game in the series. However, they were denied entry into the second round by a single goal and would ultimately fall to the Capitals in seven games. As a result, game 6 was the Islanders' last game at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum; the Isles'\nCal Clutterbuck\nscored the final NHL goal in the building's first run prior to the Islanders' return in 2018.\nMove to Barclays Center and playoff series win (2015\u20132017)\n[\nedit\n]\nIn June 2015, the Islanders entered the\n2015 draft\nwithout a first-round pick, but emerged with two first-rounders in\nMathew Barzal\nand\nAnthony Beauvillier\nafter a series of draft day trades.\n[\n140\n]\nThe Islanders also selected forward\nAndong Song\nin the sixth round of the 2015 draft, making him the first Chinese player to be drafted by an NHL team.\n[\n141\n]\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\n. The Islanders played their home games there from 2015 to 2020.\nThe Islanders played their first regular season game at\nBarclays Center\non October 9, 2015, losing 3\u20132 in overtime to the\nChicago Blackhawks\n.\nArtem Anisimov\nscored the first regular season goal, while Tavares scored the first regular season Islanders goal. The Islanders posted the fourth-best penalty kill rate and allowed the fewest power-play goals during the season. However, in the last quarter of the regular season, some players, including Halak and defenseman\nTravis Hamonic\n, suffered key injuries. The team finished the regular season fourth in the Metropolitan Division with 100 points, enough to clinch the first wild card spot in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced off against the\nFlorida Panthers\n; goaltender\nThomas Greiss\nonly played in 40 minutes of playoff hockey with the\nSan Jose Sharks\nprior to this series. Both teams split the first four games of the series. The fifth game of the series proved to be a major turning point, as late season call-up\nAlan Quine\nscored the game-winning goal on the power play with four minutes left in double overtime to end the second-longest game in franchise history; that goal gave them a 3\u20132 series lead and a chance to clinch the series on home ice. In the sixth game, the Islanders trailed 1\u20130 for much of the game, but Tavares tied it late in the third period. Tavares would score again with the series-clinching goal in double overtime to give the Islanders their first playoff series win since 1993. In the second round of the playoffs, they faced the Tampa Bay Lightning for the first time since 2004. Despite winning the first game of the series, the Islanders lost their series to the Lightning in five games.\nAndrew Ladd\nprior to a game during the\n2016\u201317 season\n. Ladd signed with the Islanders as a free agent during the 2016 off-season.\nSummer of 2016 saw free agents and longtime Islanders Kyle Okposo, Frans Nielsen, and Matt Martin all depart the team, joining the\nBuffalo Sabres\n,\nDetroit Red Wings\n, and\nToronto Maple Leafs\n, respectively. Snow signed free agents\nAndrew Ladd\nfrom the\nChicago Blackhawks\nand\nJason Chimera\nfrom the\nWashington Capitals\nto help fill the gaps left behind.\n[\n142\n]\nAfter an underwhelming first half of the\n2016\u201317 season\n, posting a 17\u201317\u20138 record through 42 games, head coach Jack Capuano was relieved of duties, with assistant general manager\nDoug Weight\nbeing named interim head coach.\n[\n143\n]\nHaving coached the team since 2010, Capuano was the second-winningest coach in the team's history with 227 wins, also leading the team to their first playoff series win since 1993.\n[\n144\n]\nPrior to Capuano's release, goaltender Jaroslav Halak was placed on waivers, and eventually sent down to the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. Having carried three goaltenders for the second consecutive season, the decision was made to stick with the tandem of Greiss and back-up\nJean-Francois Berube\nafter Halak posted a 6\u20138\u20135 record with a .904 save percentage through the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season.\n[\n145\n]\nIn late January 2017, following a report by\nBloomberg News\nwhich speculated that Barclays Center was considering removing the Islanders due to poor attendance and effects on the venue's profit margins (reception to Barclays Center as a hockey venue was mixed partly due to obstructed view seats,\n[\n146\n]\nas well as features like an off-center scoreboard, and the Islanders had the third-worst average attendance in the entire league while playing at the venue),\nNewsday\nreported that Nassau County executive Edward Mangano had met with one of the team's co-owners, and told the paper that it was possible that the Islanders could return to the renovated Nassau Coliseum.\n[\n147\n]\n[\n148\n]\nHowever, commissioner\nGary Bettman\nconsidered the concept to be \"unviable\" (the renovation reduced the capacity of the arena to just under 14,000, which is smaller than any NHL arena), and noted that Ledecky and Malkin were pursuing a possible arena project at\nBelmont Park\n.\n[\n149\n]\nDespite winning their last six games of the 2016\u201317 season, the Islanders finished in ninth place in the Eastern Conference; they missed the playoffs by only one point when the Toronto Maple Leafs clinched the final playoff spot on the penultimate day of the season.\nEmergence of Barzal and management overhaul (2017\u2013present)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn February 9, 2018, rookie\nMathew Barzal\nrecorded his third five-point game, becoming only the second rookie to do so since\nJoe Malone\nin 1917\u201318 and tying a 100-year-old record in the process.\n[\n150\n]\nAt the end of the 2017\u201318 regular season, Barzal had 85 points (22 goals, 63 assists).

Then, after blowing a 3\u20131 series lead to the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nthat extended the series to seven games, the Islanders would go on to win game 7 against the Flyers and advance to the conference finals for the first time since the\n1993 playoffs\n. However, their run would come to an end at the hands of the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nin six games.

The lower part of the Y is made to resemble a hockey stick, with three orange stripes near the bottom of the shaft and a puck to the right of the stick blade. At the bottom of the logo, the name of the team is written so that the tip of the \"I\" ends in a point aimed at\nUniondale\n, the location of Nassau Coliseum.\nBefore the\n1995\u201396 season\n, the Islanders attempted to update their look by introducing a new logo depicting a fisherman holding a hockey stick. The new logo was a marketing disaster; the reaction among the fanbase was so negative that management announced it would revert to the original logo as soon as league rules allowed them to do so. Many found that the logo bore a strong resemblance to the\nGorton's fisherman\n; indeed,\nNew York Rangers\nfans taunted the Islanders with chants of \"We want\nfishsticks\n!\" long after the logo was discarded.\n[\n184\n]\nThe traditional logo was phased back in over the next two seasons, starting as an\nalternate jersey\nlogo in\n1996\u201397\nbefore fully replacing the fisherman in\n1997\u201398\n. The only change to the classic logo at this time was its colors; as the team had replaced its original royal blue with navy, the logo was recolored to match.\nThe short-lived \"Fisherman\" logo, used from 1995 to 1997\nBeginning in\n2008\u201309\n, the Islanders introduced another modification to their original logo for their new third jersey. The \"new\" logo, once again in royal blue, now features four orange stripes on the hockey stick instead of three, representing the four consecutive Stanley Cup titles won by the team in the 1980s. This became the team's full-time logo in 2010.\nFor their\n2014 Stadium Series\nspecial jerseys, the Islanders used a simplified jersey logo with just the \"NY\" from their regular logo. Versions of that have since appeared on third jersey designs.\nJerseys\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders debuted in 1972 with traditional-style jerseys: one was white with orange and royal blue stripes near the waistline and on the sleeves, the other was royal blue with white and orange stripes. The design remained largely the same, with only minor tweaks through the\n1994\u201395 season\n.\nPrior to the\n1995\u201396 season\n, team executives decided to change the jersey. The fisherman logo replaced the \"NY\" circular design, incorporating navy blue and a brighter orange, and introducing teal and gray shades. The team was seeking increased merchandise revenues, with the outward justification of connecting the team more overtly to Long Island. The jersey included a lighthouse shoulder patch, a reference to the\nMontauk Lighthouse\n, and featured uneven stripes resembling an ocean wave near the waistline, on the sleeves, and across the shoulders. All of the numbering and lettering on the jerseys also followed the wave pattern.\n[\n185\n]\nLate in the season, the team eliminated the fisherman logo, but league rules forbade them from switching jersey designs for the\n1996\u201397 season\non only a few months' notice. Instead, they debuted their first\nthird (and fourth) jerseys\n, which were identical to the home and road jerseys worn by the team, except the circular \"NY\" crest, now colored in the navy blue and bright orange shades to match, replaced the fisherman logo. The team wore these jerseys in approximately 15 games during that season and adopted them permanently in the\n1997\u201398 season\n.\nThe shoulder logo used on Islanders jerseys from 1998 through 2010\nPrior to the\n1998\u201399 season\n, the team's jerseys reverted to a traditional design but kept the navy blue and bright orange shades from the jerseys used the previous three seasons. They added a shoulder patch of four bars, alternating in color, to represent the Islanders' four Stanley Cup championships. A predominantly orange third jersey was introduced in\n2002\u201303\n, featuring navy blue yokes and sides that formed sharp points on the sleeves and body. The team wore this jersey through the\n2006\u201307 season\n.\nFor the\n2007\u201308 season\n, the Islanders redesigned their uniforms as all NHL teams changed over to the\nReebok Edge\nsystem. These jerseys resembled the prior design but included uniform numbers on the right chest above the logo. The name plates were also in two colored format: white on orange on the navy blue home jersey and navy blue on orange on the white road jersey. The sleeves on both jerseys were orange, with a wide navy stripe above a thin white stripe at the elbow. The jerseys had a thin stripe tracing around the shoulders, and featured \"retro\" laces at the neck.\nA royal blue throwback design was introduced the following season as a third jersey. Before the\n2010\u201311 season\n, the Islanders made this throwback design their new home jersey. A corresponding new white road jersey was unveiled during the Islanders'\ndraft\nparty at Nassau Coliseum.\n[\n186\n]\nFor the following season, they unveiled an alternate jersey in black with grey on the shoulder yoke. The front of the jersey bore the team name above the player's number in orange with blue and white trim. The Islanders crest was placed on the shoulder yoke. Diagonal side panels, blue trimmed in orange and gray, combined with similar panels on the black pants to form a diamond shape on the sides of each player. These were only used sparing for two seasons, as they proved unpopular.\nDuring the\n2014 Stadium Series\n, the Islanders wore a special edition jersey. The front side featured the \"NY\" from the primary logo in a special chrome treatment, while the back side featured a white nameplate with blue letters for player names, and bigger numbers in white trimmed in orange for visibility purposes. The sleeve numbers were also angled diagonally. The primary Islanders logo would be placed on the left shoulder within the white yoke. This jersey was promoted to an alternate third jersey in the\n2014\u201315 season\n, replacing the black third jersey. During that season, on February 3, 2015, the team wore an updated version of the fisherman jersey for warmups before their game against the\nFlorida Panthers\n.\n[\n187\n]\n[\n188\n]\nThe Islanders retired the Stadium Series third jersey after only one season, replacing it with a new black alternate that was unveiled to coincide with the team's move to Brooklyn. Unlike the previous black alternate, this version featured little blue and orange at all (these colors appear only on the rear collar), while the \"NY\" insignia that was carried over from the Stadium Series jersey was stripped of its chrome accents. The four narrow white stripes on the sleeves symbolize the franchise's four Stanley Cup wins.\nWhen the NHL switched to\nAdidas\nas its uniform provider in 2017, the Islanders kept their primary jerseys mostly intact except for the restoration of the blue trim in the primary logo on the road jersey. As with all NHL teams, the Islanders only wore two jerseys for the 2017\u201318 season, thus retiring the all-black third jerseys.\nThe Islanders released a new blue third jersey for the 2018\u201319 season, featuring an updated \"NY\" insignia (shorter \"Y-stick\" with four orange stripes on the blade), white shoulder yoke (reminiscent of the 2014 Stadium Series alternates), the map of Long Island on the collar, and orange numbers that call back to the jerseys used during the team's inaugural season.\n[\n189\n]\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the Islanders released a special \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform. The uniform resembled their current home jerseys, but used the navy blue and bright orange scheme worn from 1995 to 2010.\n[\n190\n]\nA second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was released in the 2022\u201323 season, using the \"Fisherman\" uniform from 1995 to 1997 but with less teal elements and diagonal orange striping.\n[\n191\n]\nDuring the\n2024 Stadium Series\n, the Islanders wore navy blue jerseys with a thick orange middle stripe. \"ISLES\" in navy blue letters was added within the orange stripe, as are the navy blue numbers.\n[\n192\n]\nThe Islanders reverted to wearing only their primary jerseys after\nFanatics\ntook over as the NHL uniform provider in 2024, even though it kept most aspects of Adidas' template and retained the use of third jerseys.\nMascot and Ice Girls\n[\nedit\n]\nIce Girls at a community event in 2013\nThe Islanders' team mascot is named \"\nSparky the Dragon\n\", who served at one point as cross-promotion with the\nArena Football League\n's\nNew York Dragons\nteam, who also played their home games at Nassau Coliseum. In the mid-1990s, the Islanders had a mascot named \"Nyisles\" whose body style went from round to human-shaped, and facial features vaguely resembled the logo fisherman, excluding its red hair and beard. Nyisles was discontinued toward the end of the\n1997\u201398 season\nwhen the team distributed \"Who kidnapped Nyisles?\" flyers implying the reason for his disappearance was because of another NHL mascot, ultimately revealed to be\nToronto Maple Leafs\nmascot\nCarlton the Bear\n. Nyisles returned as the secondary mascot of the club with a brand new look in December 2022 to coincide with the return of the Fisherman logo on the team's reverse retro uniforms.\n[\n193\n]\nFrom the 2001\u201302 season to the 2014\u201315 season, the Islanders also had an ice crew named the \"Ice Girls\", made up of only women who skated onto the ice during television breaks to clean up the snow that piled up during the game. The Ice Girls were also used for promotional purposes during games and at community events. Starting in the 2015\u201316 season, a co-ed ice crew would replace the Ice Girls.\nSeason-by-season record\n[\nedit\n]\nThis is only a partial list of the last five seasons.

As of 2019, five of the Metropolitan Area's nine \"Big Four\" franchises play their full schedules within the New York City limits.

New York is one of four metropolitan areas to have two baseball teams (Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco being the others). The city's two current\nMajor League Baseball\nteams are the\nNew York Yankees\nand the\nNew York Mets\n. The city also was once home to the New York Giants (now the\nSan Francisco Giants\n) and the Brooklyn Dodgers (now the\nLos Angeles Dodgers\n). There is also one\nMinor League Baseball\nteam in the city, the\nBrooklyn Cyclones\n, with numerous independent minor league teams throughout the metro area.\nBasketball\nis one of the most widely played recreation sports in the city, and professional basketball is also widely followed. Despite the solid popularity of the sport, no college or pro basketball team from the New York City area has won a championship since 1973, when the Knicks won.  The city's\nNational Basketball Association\nteams are the long-established\nNew York Knicks\nand the\nBrooklyn Nets\n, who became the first sports team representing Brooklyn in over 50 years when they moved to the borough from New Jersey for the 2012\u201313 NBA season.  The city's\nWomen's National Basketball Association\nteam is the\nNew York Liberty\n. The first national basketball championship for major colleges, the\nNational Invitation Tournament\n, was held in New York in 1938,\n[\n3\n]\nand its semifinal and final rounds remain in the city.\n[\n4\n]\nRucker Park\nin\nHarlem\nis a celebrated court where many professional athletes play in the summer league.  Because of the city's strong historical connections with both professional and college basketball, the New York Knicks' home arena,\nMadison Square Garden\n, is often called the \"Mecca of basketball.\"\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\n[\n7\n]\nFootball\nis the city's third most followed sport, behind baseball and basketball. Football however is actually the 2nd most popular sport in the suburbs and the most popular when it includes upstate New York as well.\n[\n1\n]\nThe city is represented in the\nNational Football League\nby the\nNew York Giants\nand\nNew York Jets\n. Both teams play in\nMetLife Stadium\nin nearby\nEast Rutherford, New Jersey\n. In 2014, the stadium hosted\nSuper Bowl XLVIII\n. The teams have an\nintra-city rivalry\n.\nIce hockey\nin New York is also widely popular and closely followed.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThere are three\nNational Hockey League\nteams in the metro area. The\nNew York Rangers\nplay in Manhattan, calling\nMadison Square Garden\nhome. The\nNew York Islanders\nplay in\nUBS Arena\nin\nBelmont Park\n. The\nNew Jersey Devils\nalso play in the New York metro area, playing in\nNewark, New Jersey\n. The Islanders'\nAmerican Hockey League\naffiliate, the\nBridgeport Islanders\n, are based in southwest Connecticut. Starting in 2024,\nNew York Sirens\nof the\nProfessional Women's Hockey League\nshares the New Jersey Devils' home arena.\n[\n8\n]\nIn\nsoccer\n, New York is represented by three teams in the top divisions for men and women, including the\nNew York Red Bulls\nand\nNew York City FC\nof\nMajor League Soccer\n, and\nNJ/NY Gotham FC\nof the\nNational Women's Soccer League\n. The Red Bulls play their home games at\nSports Illustrated Stadium\nin\nHarrison, New Jersey\n, as does Gotham FC. New York City FC, a new team owned by\nManchester City F.C.\nand the New York Yankees, joined MLS in 2015. NYCFC, which plays most home games at Yankee Stadium with a secondary home venue at Citi Field, has plans to build a\nsoccer-specific stadium\nin Queens and instantly develop an intra-city rivalry with the Red Bulls.\n[\n9\n]\nRegardless of where they actually play their home games, most of these teams carry the name of and represent the entire city or State of New York, except for the NBA's\nBrooklyn Nets\n, who play in and specifically represent the New York City borough of Brooklyn, and the NHL's\nNew Jersey Devils\n, who have played their home games in New Jersey since their founding. The\nNew York Red Bulls\n(\nMLS\nfounding franchise originally named the \"New York/New Jersey MetroStars\")\u2013who have also always played in New Jersey\u2013were the only major professional soccer team representing the metropolitan area during their first 19 seasons, and the region's second MLS club,\nNew York City FC\n, deliberately staked its identity to actually playing in the city, drawing its colors from the\ncity flag\nand even featuring the flag itself on its uniforms.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nThe area's women's soccer club, NJ/NY Gotham FC, also uses the two sets of initials as the MetroStars once did, although listing New Jersey first (the\ngovernor of New Jersey\nis the club's primary owner).\n[\n12\n]\nSoccer\n[\nedit\n]\nHudson River Derby\nmatch between the\nNew York Red Bulls\nand\nNew York City FC\nProfessional soccer, as in the rest of the country, is rapidly growing in popularity in New York. The\nNew York Red Bulls\nof\nMajor League Soccer\n(originally known as the \"MetroStars\" until the team's purchase by Austrian corporation\nRed Bull GmbH\nin 2006) have played in the metropolitan area since the league's founding in 1996. Since 2010 they have played at\nSports Illustrated Stadium\n, a\nsoccer-specific stadium\nin\nHarrison, New Jersey\n, with a capacity of just over 25,000.\n[\n13\n]\nThe Red Bulls have won the\nSupporters' Shield\n, awarded to the team with the best regular season record, on three occasions, most recently in\n2018\n.\nOn May 21, 2013, MLS announced that\nNew York City FC\nwould be the league's 20th team, jointly owned by the English club\nManchester City F.C.\nand the New York Yankees.  They began playing in MLS in 2015 at\nYankee Stadium\nin\nthe Bronx\n, and became the first New York City-area team to win the\nMLS Cup\nin\n2021\n.  After a ten-year campaign to build a stadium within the five boroughs of New York City, the club announced in November 2022 that they had a deal to build\nEtihad Park\n, a privately-funded 25,000-seat stadium in the\nWillets Point\nneighborhood of Queens.\n[\n14\n]\nThe new stadium, the first soccer-specific stadium in New York City, will be the centerpiece of a 23-acre redevelopment project in the former industrial area, including a 250-room hotel, 2,500 affordable housing units, retail space and a public elementary school.\n[\n15\n]\nPel\u00e9\nplayed for the\nNew York Cosmos\nfrom 1975 to 1977.\nThe New York City area was once home to the\nNew York Cosmos\n(1970\u20131984), which was arguably the most popular American soccer team ever.\n[\n16\n]\nPlaying in the\nFIFA\n-backed, major professional\nNorth American Soccer League\n(NASL), the Cosmos were known for fielding some of the world's greatest players including\nPel\u00e9\n,\nFranz Beckenbauer\n,\nCarlos Alberto Torres\n,\nJohan Neeskens\n, and\nGiorgio Chinaglia\n. The acquisition of these foreign players, particularly Pel\u00e9, made the Cosmos into what Gavin Newsham called \"the most glamorous team in world football\", and contributed to the development of soccer across the United States. The club won the\nSoccer Bowl\nfive times:\n1972\n,\n1977\n,\n1978\n,\n1980\n, and\n1982\n. Soccer Bowl '78, which was held at\nGiants Stadium\n, saw a record crowd of 74,091 \u2013 the highest attendance to date for any club soccer championship in the United States. Cosmos road trips, described by traveling secretary Steve Marshall as \"like traveling with\nthe Rolling Stones\n\", saw the team pack out each stadium it visited, while at home, the team attracted numerous high-profile celebrity supporters. While soccer had previously been largely ignored by the American press, the Cosmos and other NASL teams now became regular fixtures on the back pages.\n[\n17\n]\nThe NASL collapsed abruptly in late 1984, and was not replaced by a new professional soccer league until\nMajor League Soccer\n's first season in 1996. A feature-length documentary about the New York club, called\nOnce in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos\n, was released in theaters in 2006. The film, narrated by\nMatt Dillon\n, featured interviews with many of the players and personalities involved with the team.\n[\n18\n]\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\nA\nsecond Cosmos club\nwas founded in 2010, beginning play in a new second-division\nNorth American Soccer League\nin 2013.\n[\n21\n]\nThe team most recently played at\nMitchel Athletic Complex\nin suburban\nUniondale, New York\n, in the third-division\nNational Independent Soccer Association\nbefore going on hiatus in January 2021.\n[\n22\n]\nBased in Brooklyn,\nBrooklyn FC\n, fields a women's team in the first-division\nUSL Super League\nin 2024 and is scheduled to add a men's team in the second-division\nUSL Championship\nbeginning in 2025.\n[\n23\n]\nNJ/NY Gotham FC\n, known before 2021 as Sky Blue FC, is one of the eight charter teams and nine current members of the\nNational Women's Soccer League\n(NWSL), the third women's professional league in the US. Since 2020, Gotham has shared Sports Illustrated Stadium with the New York Red Bulls. The organization had previously been charter members of NWSL's effective predecessor,\nWomen's Professional Soccer\n. The league started play in\n2009\n; Sky Blue became the league's inaugural champion despite finishing fourth in the league during the regular season, which meant that they had to play on the road in all three\nWPS playoff games\n. The defunct\nNew York Power\nwas the region's first professional women's soccer team, playing in the\nWomen's United Soccer Association\nfrom 2000 to 2003.\nThe men's semi-pro teams\nManhattan SC\nand\nF.A. Euro\nplay in the fourth tier of U.S. Soccer in\nUSL League Two\n.\nMajor League Soccer\n's headquarters are located in New York City, at 420\nFifth Avenue\n.\n[\n24\n]\nNew York City was one of the host cities of the\n1994 FIFA World Cup\nand will be one of eleven U.S. host cities for the\n2026 FIFA World Cup\n, with the\nfinal\ntaking place at\nMetLife Stadium\n.\n[\n25\n]\nThe city also hosted the\nCopa Am\u00e9rica Centenario final\nin 2016 and the\n2025 FIFA Club World Cup final\n.\nBaseball\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nList of baseball parks in New York City\nIn New York, baseball is still regarded as the most popular sport, despite being overtaken by football in terms of perceived popularity (but not attendance) throughout the country, as based on TV ratings and consistent fan following for the entire season.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nNew York is home to two\nMajor League Baseball\nfranchises. The\nNew York Yankees\nof the\nAmerican League\nhave played in New York since 1903. Known for iconic ballplayers such as\nBabe Ruth\n,\nLou Gehrig\n,\nJoe DiMaggio\n,\nMickey Mantle\n,\nYogi Berra\nand countless others, they play in\nYankee Stadium\nin\nthe Bronx\nand have won the\nWorld Series\n27 times, the most victories by any team in the four\nmajor North American professional sports leagues\n. The\nNew York Mets\nhave represented New York in the\nNational League\nsince 1962. The Mets play in\nCiti Field\nin\nFlushing, Queens\nand have won five NL pennants and two World Series, thus making them one of the most decorated expansion teams in Major League Baseball. The \"\nSubway Series\n\" is the name used for all regular season and World Series meetings between the two teams. Before\ninterleague play\nwas introduced in 1997, the only instance these two teams could have played each other would have been in the World Series. The Mets and Yankees played for the\nWorld Series in 2000\n, with the Yankees winning the series 4\u20131.\nCiti Field\n, home of the\nNew York Mets\nin Queens\nFor many New York baseball fans, the most intense rivalry is between the\nYankees and the Boston Red Sox\n, arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports.\n[\n26\n]\n[\n27\n]\n[\n28\n]\nWhen the Mets beat the Red Sox in the\n1986 World Series\n, many Yankee fans attended the parade celebrating the Mets' win, saying that \"anyone who beats Boston is worth coming down for.\"\n[\n29\n]\nThere have been 14 Subway Series World Series match-ups between the Yankees and their\nNational League\nrivals; the Mets (once), and with the two teams that departed for California in the 1950s \u2014 the\nBrooklyn Dodgers\n(7 times) and\nNew York Giants\n(6 times).\nNew York City is also home to one\nMinor League Baseball\nteam, the\nBrooklyn Cyclones\n.  They are the Mets\nHigh-A\naffiliate, playing in the\nHigh-A East\n. Two\nindependent baseball league\nteams also play in the New York metropolitan area, with a third planned. The\nLong Island Ducks\nof the independent\nAtlantic League\nhave played in\nBethpage Ballpark\nin\nCentral Islip\nsince 2000, and were joined by a club playing in the city limits when the\nStaten Island FerryHawks\nbegan play at\nSIUH Community Park\nin 2022.\n[\n30\n]\nIn 2011, the\nNew York Boulders\n, now of the independent\nFrontier League\n, began play at\nClover Stadium\nin\nPomona\n.\nNew York has historically had many short-lived baseball clubs including the\nNew York Mutuals\n,\nBrooklyn Atlantics\n,\nBrooklyn Enterprise\n,\nExcelsior of Brooklyn\nand\nBrooklyn Eckfords\nof the\nNational Association of Baseball Players\n; the\nNew York Knickerbockers\n, one of the first baseball teams; the\nNew York Metropolitans\nand\nBrooklyn Gladiators\nof the\nAmerican Association (19th century)\n; the\nNew York Giants (PL)\nand\nBrooklyn Ward's Wonders\nof the\nPlayers' League\n; the\nBrooklyn Tip-Tops\nof the\nFederal League\n; the\nBrooklyn Bushwicks\n, Springfield Greys, Barton's Nighthawks, Glendale Farmers, Mount Vernon Scarlets, Union City Reds, Carlton's of the Bronx, and Bay Parkway, Bay Ridge, Cedarhurst, West New York, and Queens Club of The Metropolitan Baseball Association;\n[\n31\n]\nand the\nNew York Highlanders\nand\nBrooklyn Bridegrooms\n, precursors to the Yankees and Dodgers. There were also two Newark Bears teams\nNewark Bears\nand\nNewark Bears (International League)\n.\nNegro league baseball\nteams also were present in New York, including the\nBrooklyn Royal Giants\n,\nNewark Stars\n,\nLincoln Giants\n,\nNewark Browns\n,\nNew York Black Yankees\n,\nNew York Cubans\n, and the\nNewark Eagles\n.\nIn 1858 in\nCorona, Queens\n, at the Fashion Race Course, the first games of baseball to charge admission took place. The games, which took place between the all-stars of\nBrooklyn\n, including players from the\nBrooklyn Atlantics\n,\nExcelsior of Brooklyn\n, Putnams and\nEckford of Brooklyn\n, and the All Stars of New York (\nManhattan\n), including players from the\nNew York Knickerbockers\n, Gothams (predecessors of the\nNew York Giants\n), Eagles and Empire, are commonly believed to the first all-star baseball games.\n[\n32\n]\nTwo historical clubs, the\nBrooklyn Dodgers\nand\nNew York Giants\n, were among the most storied clubs in professional baseball, and were home to such players as\nJackie Robinson\nand\nWillie Mays\n. The two teams left for\nCalifornia\n\u2014the Dodgers for Los Angeles and the Giants for San Francisco\u2014in 1957. The city currently has two\nMajor League Baseball\nteams, the Mets (who were formed in 1962 to replace the Dodgers and the Giants), and the Yankees.\nMajor League Baseball's headquarters are located in New York City, at\n245 Park Avenue\nin Manhattan.\n[\n33\n]\nBasketball\n[\nedit\n]\nMadison Square Garden\n, home of the\nNew York Knicks\n(NBA) and\nNew York Rangers\n(NHL) in Manhattan\nThe first national\nbasketball\nchampionship for major colleges, the\nNational Invitation Tournament\n, was held in New York in 1938, and its semifinal and final rounds remain at\nMadison Square Garden\n. The NIT has spawned a major early-season tournament known as the\nNIT Season Tip-Off\n; the semifinal and final rounds of that event are also held at the Garden.\nAt Madison Square Garden, New Yorkers can watch the\nNew York Knicks\nplay\nNBA\nbasketball. Through the 2017\nWNBA\nseason, the\nNew York Liberty\nalso played at the Garden, but that team's main home has changed twice since then. First, the team moved to\nWestchester County Center\nin\nWhite Plains\nin 2018. Then, after the team's 2019 purchase by\nthe owner\nof the NBA's\nBrooklyn Nets\n, the Liberty have moved to the Nets' home of\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\nin 2020.\nThe Nets began playing in Brooklyn in 2012, the first major professional sports team to play in the historic borough in half a century. Before the merger of the defunct\nAmerican Basketball Association\nwith the NBA during the 1976\u201377 season, the New York Nets, who shared the same home arena (\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\n) on Long Island with the NHL's New York Islanders, were a two-time champion in the ABA and starred the famous Hall of Fame forward\nJulius Erving\n. During the first season of the merger (1976\u201377), the Nets continued to play on Long Island, although Erving's contract had by then been sold to the Philadelphia 76ers. The Nets transferred to New Jersey then next season and became known as the New Jersey Nets, and later moved to Brooklyn prior to the 2012\u201313 NBA season.\nBarclays Center\n, home of the\nBrooklyn Nets\n(NBA) and\nNew York Liberty\n(WNBA) in Brooklyn\nThe\nLong Island Nets\n, an\nNBA G League\nteam, started playing at the Barclays Center in 2016 before moving to\nNassau Coliseum\nin 2017. The\nWestchester Knicks\nstarted in 2014 at the Westchester County Center.\nRucker Park\nin\nHarlem\nis a celebrated court where many NBA athletes play in the summer league.\nThe\nNBA\n's headquarters are located in New York City, at\nFifth Avenue\n's\nOlympic Tower\n.\n[\n34\n]\nThe\nNew York Liberty\nare one of the original teams of the\nWNBA\n, which was formed in 1997.  The team's main venue moved from Madison Square Garden to Westchester County Center after the 2017 season, and then to Barclays Center after the 2019 season. During a massive renovation project at the Garden between 2011 and 2013, the Liberty temporarily played their home games at the\nPrudential Center\nin Newark, New Jersey. The team were the last remaining original franchise in the WNBA to win a championship, which they finally won in 2024.\nFrom 1933 to 1935, Newark had a team in the\nAmerican Basketball League\n. It its first season it was known as the\nNewark Bears\n, and in its second and final season the Newark Mules.\nThere was briefly a\nLong Island Ducks basketball\nteam at the\nLong Island Arena\nin 1977\u20131978.\nLong Island PrimeTime\nplayed at Louis Armstrong Gymnasium in Flushing from 2006 to 2007. They were part of the\nUnited States Basketball League\n.\nAmerican football\n[\nedit\n]\nMetLife Stadium\n, home to both the\nNew York Giants\nand the\nNew York Jets\nSince 2010, both the\nNew York Giants\nand the\nNew York Jets\nplay in\nMetLife Stadium\nin nearby\nEast Rutherford, New Jersey\n, 5 miles from New York City. In 2014, the stadium hosted\nSuper Bowl XLVIII\n. The Giants and Jets were previously located in New York City; both teams played in the\nPolo Grounds\n(Manhattan) and\nShea Stadium\n(Queens), and the Giants played in\nYankee Stadium\n(the Bronx). Neither team plays in the city itself presently, as both teams are located in the\nMeadowlands Sports Complex\nin East Rutherford, New Jersey, playing in\nGiants Stadium\nfor many years before moving to MetLife Stadium. The Giants, a keystone\nNFL\nfranchise, were founded in 1925, and exist today as one of the oldest presently active organizations in the NFL. Founded in 1960, the originally named New York Titans, later branded as the Jets in 1963, were a charter member of the\nAmerican Football League\n(AFL), joining the NFL as part of the AFL/NFL merger in 1970.\nNew York City also had many historical professional teams.  The first professional team in New York was called both the\nNew York Giants and Brooklyn Giants\n(unrelated to the current New York Giants), and played in the predecessor to the NFL, the\nAmerican Professional Football Association\n, in 1921. In 1926, the\nNew York Yankees\n,\nNewark Bears (AFL)\nand\nBrooklyn Horsemen\nplayed in the\nAmerican Football League\n, and on the same year, the\nBrooklyn Lions\nplayed in the\nNational Football League\nbefore the Horsemen and Lions merged in November and folded at season's end. The Lions' NFL franchise rights were given to the Yankees, who competed in the NFL from 1927 to 1928. When the Yankees folded, its rights were given to the existing barnstorming team\nStaten Island Stapletons\n, who played in the NFL until 1932 when it stopped league play and later folded as well.\nIn 1930, the NFL\nBrooklyn Dodgers\nbegan play at Ebbets Field. The team lasted until 1944, calling themselves the Brooklyn Tigers that last season but going winless. In 1945, the team was merged with the\nBoston Yanks\nand played one more home game in Brooklyn that season as the Yanks.\nAnother team going by the name\nNew York Yankees\nplayed in the second AFL in 1936 and 1937. The league also had a\nBrooklyn Tigers\nclub in 1936, but the team never played in Brooklyn and folded after only seven games. A\nthird incarnation of the Yankees\nplayed in the third AFL in 1940 under the Yankees name, and then in 1941 as the\nNew York Americans\n. Another version of the New York Yankees was a short-lived member of the\nAmerican Association\nIn 1946, the new\nAll-America Football Conference\nhad yet another set of\nBrooklyn Dodgers\nand\nNew York Yankees\nteams. These clubs lasted until 1948, after which they merged with each other.  The renamed Brooklyn-New York Yankees folded after one season when the\nAAFC merged with the NFL\n.\nThe\nNew York Bulldogs\nwere founded in 1949, sharing the\nPolo Grounds\nwith the New York Giants, and then being renamed as the New York Yanks and playing in the NFL in the 1950 and 1951 seasons. In 1952, the team was relocated to Texas and renamed as the\nDallas Texans\n.\nIn 1974, New York briefly hosted a team known as the\nNew York Stars\nfor the short-lived\nWorld Football League\n, but in mid-season the team was relocated to Charlotte and became the\nCharlotte Hornets\n.\nThe short-lived\nUnited States Football League\nhad a team in the New York area. The\nNew Jersey Generals\nplayed at\nGiants Stadium\nin\nThe Meadowlands\nfrom 1983 to 1985. At one point, the team was owned by future\nPresident\nDonald Trump\n. The team folded with the rest of the league.\nIn 1988, the\nNew York Knights\nplayed for one season as part of the\nArena Football League\n, and then ceased operations. In 1997, the AFL added two expansion franchises, the\nNew York CityHawks\n, who played at Madison Square Garden, and the\nNew Jersey Red Dogs\n, who played in\nEast Rutherford, New Jersey\n. The CityHawks moved to\nHartford, Connecticut\nand were renamed the New England Sea Wolves in 1999, and then relocated to Toronto in 2001, and renamed the Toronto Phantoms. The Red Dogs were renamed the New Jersey Gladiators in 2001, then relocated and became the Las Vegas Gladiators in 2003, before relocating again and being renamed the Cleveland Gladiators. When the Sea Wolves, who were owned by the\nMadison Square Garden Company\nand had their games televised in New York City on\nMSG Network\n, relocated to Toronto, the AFL's Iowa Barnstormers relocated to Long Island and were renamed the\nNew York Dragons\n. The Dragons played in New York until 2008, when the league suspended operations; no team from New York (either the city or the state) played in the league from its 2010 revival until the\nAlbany Empire\n, based in the state's capital, joined the AFL in 2018.\nThe Jets are sometimes regarded as \"\nLong Island's Team\n\" supported by the fact that until 2008, the team trained in\nHempstead\nat\nHofstra University\n, and used to play at\nShea Stadium\n(former home of the\nNew York Mets\nbaseball team) which is close to Nassau County. Statistically, the largest percentage of the Jets fanbase derives from Long Island, hence, the Jets generally receive more media coverage in that part of New York.\n[\n35\n]\nFans of both the Giants and Jets traditionally root for both the New York Yankees and the New York Mets as well as both the\nNew York Knicks\nand the\nBrooklyn Nets\nof the\nNBA\nand also both the\nNew York Rangers\nand the\nNew York Islanders\nof the\nNHL\n.\nTwo attempts by\nVince McMahon\nat creating a competing football league, both named the XFL, have been attempted in the New York metropolitan area. The first\nXFL\nleague was created as a joint venture between\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment\nand\nNBC\n[\n36\n]\nin 2001, had the\nNew York/New Jersey Hitmen\nplaying at Giants Stadium for the only season they played before the\nleague folded\n. The New York/New Jersey Hitmen finished in third for the XFL Eastern Division for the season they played.\n[\n37\n]\nIn 2020, the\nNew York Guardians\nof the newly revived\nXFL\nbegan playing at MetLife Stadium.\n[\n38\n]\nAfter the XFL filed for\nChapter 11 bankruptcy\non April 13, 2020,\n[\n39\n]\nciting the premature suspension of their season due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n, the Guardians moved to\nOrlando, Florida\nand the league no longer has a New York team.\nAlong with New York's two NFL teams, the New York metropolitan area is home to the\nNew York Sharks\nwomen's football team. The New York Sharks are NYC's premier professional women's tackle football team.  Established in 1999 the Sharks are the longest-running and most decorated team in women's tackle football having won 3 conference titles (2002, 2003, 2004 IWFL East), 6 division titles (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 IWFL) and two championship titles (2002 IWFL, 2018 WFA). The Sharks play at many fields and have no official home stadium.  The season for women's football is from April to June with playoffs and the championship game occurring from June to July. As of 2011 the Sharks are now with the WFA (Women's Football Alliance\n[2]\n) along with the Bay Area Bandits, Boston Militia, Chicago Force, Dallas Diamonds, DC Divas, Kansas City Tribe, Pittsburgh Passion, and the San Diego Surge in an effort to bring together the best franchises of women's football.\nThe\nNFL\n's headquarters are located in New York City, at\n345 Park Avenue\nin Manhattan.\n[\n40\n]\nIce hockey\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nNassau Coliseum\nin Uniondale, was home to the\nNew York Islanders\nfrom 1972 to 2015 (and temporarily from 2018 to 2021), and the\nNew York Nets\nfrom 1972 to 1976.\nUBS Arena\nin Elmont has served as the home of the New York Islanders since 2021.\nIce hockey\nhas a storied history and large following in the New York metropolitan area, which is unique in being the only metropolitan area and media market in the United States and Canada to feature three major league professional teams participating in the same sport. New York City is represented by the\nNew York Rangers\n, playing at\nMadison Square Garden\nin\nManhattan\n. The\nNew York Islanders\nplay at\nUBS Arena\nin the\nNassau County\ncommunity of\nElmont\n. The\nNew Jersey Devils\nplay at\nPrudential Center\nin\nNewark, New Jersey\n. The metropolitan area's three\nNHL\nfranchises have won the\nStanley Cup\na combined eleven times, and they are historically division rivals with high levels of intensity and animosity among and between their respective fans, having played in the same division every season since the Devils relocated to the\nNew Jersey Meadowlands\nfrom\nDenver\nin 1982. Currently, they play in the\nMetropolitan Division\n.\nThe Rangers, established in 1926, are one of the\nOriginal Six\n\u2014 a term given to the six NHL teams in existence before the league\ndoubled its size\nin 1967. The primary fan base for the Rangers is in the city's five boroughs,\nWestchester County\n, lower Hudson Valley New York, western Connecticut, and Northern New Jersey. However, they maintain a sizable following within parts of the market claimed by their two local rivals.\nThe Islanders, established in 1972, opened the new UBS Arena, adjacent to\nBelmont Park\nand immediately across the\nCross Island Parkway\nfrom\nQueens\n, for the\n2021\u201322 season\n. The Islanders provide their fans with an\nintense rivalry with the Rangers\n, most of whom are based in\nNassau\nand\nSuffolk\nCounties on\nLong Island\n. The chosen location of their new home also includes a new full-time\nLong Island Rail Road\nstation at\nElmont\n, providing direct access from\nPenn Station\nand other points both in New York City and out east on Long Island. This has the effect of connecting all three area NHL franchises with a single transfer at Manhattan's Penn Station (located beneath Madison Square Garden) necessary to reach\nNewark Penn Station\n(two blocks from the Devils' Prudential Center) from Elmont.\nPrudential Center\nin Newark has served as the home of the New Jersey Devils since 2007 and was the home of the New Jersey Nets from 2010 to 2012.\nThe Devils, who moved from\nDenver, Colorado\nto New Jersey in 1982, provide area hockey fans with yet another\nintense rivalry\ninvolving the Rangers largely stemming from geographic proximity, a manifestation of a long-standing rivalry between the states of New York and New Jersey. Both teams have achieved famous results for their respective fan bases in playoff meetings, including the\n1994 Eastern Conference Finals\n, ending in a dramatic double-overtime goal by the Rangers'\nSt\u00e9phane Matteau\nduring the 7th and deciding game. The Devils took a 3\u20132 series lead into Game 6 in New Jersey and jumped out to a 2\u20130 lead in the game. However,\nMark Messier\n's famous guarantee and\nhat-trick\nled the Rangers to victory and a seventh game. As time wound down in Game 7, the Rangers were clinging to a 1\u20130 lead when New Jersey's\nValeri Zelepukin\ntied the game with 7.7 seconds left in regulation to silence the Garden crowd and send the game into overtime, where Matteau won it for the Rangers. In the\n2012 Eastern Conference Finals\n, the Rangers would be in a very similar scenario, but would ultimately fail to overcome the 3\u20132 series deficit after trailing 2-0 and forcing overtime in Game 6 across the Hudson River at\nPrudential Center\nin\nNewark\non a series-winning goal only 1:03 into overtime by\nAdam Henrique\n. As of their most recent meeting in\n2023's First Round\nin which the Devils rallied to win in seven games after recovering from a 0\u20132 series deficit, the Devils and Rangers have met seven times in the playoffs, with the first three series won by the Rangers, and three of the last four series won by the Devils. The Devils' primary fan base resides throughout Northern and Central New Jersey, specifically areas of the state coterminous with the New York media and sports market where the\nMSG\nnetworks (which serve as the television home for all three area hockey teams) are available.\nThe Islanders and Rangers had a bitter rivalry in the 1970s and the 1980s, as the Islanders won four consecutive\nStanley Cup\ntitles; the Rangers won their most recent NHL championship in the\n1994 Stanley Cup Finals\n, the fourth Cup victory in that team's history. The two teams have met eight times in the playoffs, with the Islanders winning five of those matchups. Incidentally, as the Islanders and Devils have had little success simultaneously (the Devils\u2019 Stanley Cup success occurred in the mid-late 1990s and early 2000s) throughout their respective histories and have faced off in the playoffs only once in the\n1987-88 season\nin a series won by the Devils, this rivalry is perceived as an afterthought in the area particularly when compared to the Rangers\u2019 rivalries with the Islanders and Devils.\nThe\nMetropolitan Riveters\n, established in 2015, were one of the four charter members of the\nNational Women's Hockey League\n(NWHL). They played home games in the\nBarnabas Health Hockey House\nat the Prudential Center in Newark beginning with the\n2016\u201317 NWHL season\n.\n[\n41\n]\nIn 2017, the Riveters announced they were partnering with the New Jersey Devils, becoming the first NWHL team to officially partner with an NHL team. In 2018, the Riveters won the\nIsobel Cup\ntitle. The NWHL, which rebranded as the Premier Hockey Federation in 2021, was purchased and dissolved in 2023 as part of an effort to create a new, unified North American women's professional league.\n[\n42\n]\nThis meant that the Riveters folded; however, New York was granted one of six charter franchises in the new\nProfessional Women's Hockey League\n.\n[\n43\n]\n[\n44\n]\nNew York Sirens\ndebuted on January 1, 2024, winning the league's inaugural game.\n[\n45\n]\nNew York City also had a historical NHL team, the\nNew York Americans\n(also known as the Amerks, and in 1941\u201342, the Brooklyn Americans), who played between 1925 and 1942. Predating the Rangers by one season, they were the first hockey team to play in the city, and for most of the life of the franchise shared Madison Square Garden with the Rangers. The franchise was never a big winner, and disbanded during World War II due to financial problems and a depleted roster. The\nWorld Hockey Association\nteam called the New York Raiders and later the\nNew York Golden Blades\nplayed at Madison Square Garden and\nCherry Hill, New Jersey\nfrom 1972 until 1974 when they moved to San Diego. A few historical minor league hockey teams played in the New York area in the\nEastern Hockey League\n.  The\nNew York Rovers\nstarted as a farm team of the Rangers in 1935 playing at Madison Square Garden. They moved to the\nLong Island Arena\nin 1959 and became the\nLong Island Ducks (ice hockey)\nuntil 1973. The\nNew York Bobcats\nare a USA Hockey-Sanctioned Tier III Junior Ice Hockey Team at Twin Rinks in Eisenhower Park from 2000 to the present. The\nNew York Apple Core\nare a Tier III Junior A Ice Hockey Team in Brewster, New York.\nThe\nNHL\n's headquarters are also located in New York City, at\nOne Manhattan West\n.\n[\n46\n]\nMajor league professional championships\n[\nedit\n]\nNew York Yankees (MLB)\n[\nedit\n]\n27 World Series titles\n1923\n1927\n1928\n1932\n1936\n1937\n1938\n1939\n1941\n1943\n1947\n1949\n1950\n1951\n1952\n1953\n1956\n1958\n1961\n1962\n1977\n1978\n1996\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2009\nNew York Mets (MLB)\n[\nedit\n]\n2 World Series titles\n1969\n1986\nNew York Giants (MLB)\n[\nedit\n]\n5 World Series titles\n1905\n1921\n1922\n1933\n1954\nBrooklyn Dodgers (MLB)\n[\nedit\n]\n1 World Series title\n1955\nNew York Cubans (NNL)\n[\nedit\n]\n1 Negro World Series title\n1947\nNew York Cosmos (NASL)\n[\nedit\n]\n5 Soccer Bowl titles\n1972\n1977\n1978\n1980\n1982\nNew York City FC (MLS)\n[\nedit\n]\n1 MLS Cup title\n2021\nNJ/NY Gotham FC (NWSL)\n[\nedit\n]\n2 Women's Professional Soccer titles\n2009\n2023\nNew York Giants (NFL)\n[\nedit\n]\n4 NFL championships (pre\u2013Super Bowl)\n1927\n1934\n1938\n1956\n4 Super Bowl titles\n1986\n(\nXXI\n)\n1990\n(\nXXV\n)\n2007\n(\nXLII\n)\n2011\n(\nXLVI\n)\nNew York Jets (NFL)\n[\nedit\n]\n1 Super Bowl title\n1968\n(\nIII\n)\nNew York Knicks (NBA)\n[\nedit\n]\n2 NBA Finals titles\n1970\n1973\nNew York / Brooklyn Nets (NBA)\n[\nedit\n]\n2 ABA Finals titles\n1974\n1976\nNew York Liberty (WNBA)\n[\nedit\n]\n1 WNBA Finals title\n2024\nNew Jersey Devils (NHL)\n[\nedit\n]\n3 Stanley Cup titles\n1995\n2000\n2003\nNew York Rangers (NHL)\n[\nedit\n]\n4 Stanley Cup titles\n1928\n1933\n1940\n1994\nNew York Islanders (NHL)\n[\nedit\n]\n4 Stanley Cup titles\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\nDemolished stadiums\n[\nedit\n]\nYankee Stadium\nEbbets Field\nPolo Grounds\nShea Stadium\nGiants Stadium\nMadison Square Garden\nNassau Coliseum\nMeadowlands Arena\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of former major league venues in New York metropolitan area\nThroughout the 20th century, the city had several historic sports venues: the\noriginal Yankee Stadium\n, home of the\nNew York Yankees\nfrom 1923 to 2008, before the team moved into their\nnew stadium\nin 2009;\nEbbets Field\n, home of the\nBrooklyn Dodgers\nfrom 1913 until 1957, which was torn down in 1960; and the\nPolo Grounds\nin northern\nHarlem\n, which was the home of the\nNew York Giants\nof\nMajor League Baseball\nfrom 1911 to 1957 (and the first home of the\nNew York Mets\n) before being demolished in 1964. The Mets, who previously played at\nShea Stadium\n, moved into the newly constructed\nCiti Field\nin 2009. Also the current\nMadison Square Garden\n, atop\nPennsylvania Station\nin\nMidtown Manhattan\n, is actually the\nfourth\nseparate building to use that name; the\nfirst\ntwo\nwere near\nMadison Square\n, hence the name, and\nthe third\nwas at 50th Street and\nEighth Avenue\n.\nThe 2000s saw almost a complete revamping of the area's major sporting venues. This began in 2007, when the Devils moved to\nNewark, New Jersey\n, and opened the\nPrudential Center\n. In 2009, both the Mets and Yankees opened new baseball stadiums adjacent to their old homes, with the Mets replacing\nShea Stadium\nwith\nCiti Field\nand the Yankees building a new\nYankee Stadium\n. In 2010, the Jets and Giants moved to a new shared facility called New Meadowlands Stadium (now\nMetLife Stadium\n) and the Red Bulls opened their own\nsoccer-specific stadium\nin\nHarrison, New Jersey\n, called\nSports Illustrated Stadium\n(the three had previously shared\nGiants Stadium\nin East Rutherford, New Jersey). In 2012, the Nets moved from New Jersey to the\nBarclays Center\nin Brooklyn and became the\nBrooklyn Nets\n. The Islanders left Nassau County, and followed the Nets into Brooklyn in 2015 before returning to a new location in Nassau County in 2021.\nOther sports-related renovations and construction work is as follows:\nMadison Square Garden\n, the home of the Knicks and Rangers, underwent a massive renovation from 2010 to 2013 which finished in time for the 2013\u201314 NHL and NBA seasons. The $850 million transformation included a rebuilding of the seating bowl and concourses, new luxury suites, new LED scoreboard and ribbon boards, and two new spectator bridges that span 65 feet (20\u00a0m) above the arena on each side of the playing surface.\nOn August 15, 2013, the Nassau County government announced that\nForest City Ratner\nhad won the bid for the renovation of the\nNassau Coliseum\n, which was vacated by the Islanders in 2015, pending approval from the Nassau legislature and the Hempstead town government.\n[\n47\n]\n[\n48\n]\nRatner's proposal called for a reduction of the Coliseum's\nseating capacity\nto 13,000 and an aesthetic revamp of the arena's interior and concrete facade designed by\nSHoP Architects\n, the firm which designed the Barclays Center, which would cost the group approximately $89 million.  As part of his bid, the Islanders would play 6 games per season in the arena, the Brooklyn Nets would play one exhibition game, and a minor league hockey team would call the arena home.\n[\n49\n]\n[\n50\n]\nPreviously\nMajor League Soccer\nwas spearheading the search for a\nnew soccer-specific stadium\nwithin city limits for use by the 20th MLS expansion team. After narrowing the locations down to six, amongst them being\nPier 40\nin Manhattan,\nGreenpoint\nin Brooklyn and the area near Citi Field in Queens, the league zeroed in on the dilapidated Fountain of Industry site in Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Queens in June 2012.\n[\n51\n]\nThe site was also previously discussed as a possible location for the New York Jets to build a stadium after their\nWest Side Stadium\nproject fell through, but the Jets opted to remain in New Jersey instead.\n[\n52\n]\nHowever, the Flushing site faced opposition from local communities regarding the usage of park space, as well as the New York Mets, who play nearby, and the project was discarded.\n[\n53\n]\nThe New York City FC expansion team took over the stadium search after its founding, and after looking at locations in the Bronx the club eventually secured\nWillets Point, Queens\n, just north of Flushing Meadows Corona Park, for its stadium site.\n[\n54\n]\n[\n15\n]\nThe new stadium is expected to open in 2027.\n[\n55\n]\nThe Islanders eventually returned to Nassau County in 2021 with the opening of\nUBS Arena\nadjacent to the\nBelmont Park\nhorse racing track in\nElmont\n.\n[\n56\n]\nMinor league sports\n[\nedit\n]\nCurrent minor league teams\n[\nedit\n]\nThe following New York metropolitan area sports teams play in a lower level professional sports leagues in the United States:\nClub\nLeague\nVenue\nLocation\nFounded\nTitles\nBrooklyn Cyclones\nSouth Atlantic League\nBaseball\nMaimonides Park\nBrooklyn, New York\n2001\n2\nLong Island Ducks\nAtlantic League\nBaseball\nBethpage Ballpark\nCentral Islip, New York\n2000\n4\nStaten Island FerryHawks\nAtlantic League\nBaseball\nSIUH Community Park\nStaten Island, New York\n2021\n0\nSomerset Patriots\nEastern League\nBaseball\nTD Bank Ballpark\nBridgewater Township, New Jersey\n1998\n7\nNew Jersey Jackals\nFrontier League\nBaseball\nHinchliffe Stadium\nPaterson, New Jersey\n1998\n6\nNew York Boulders\nFrontier League\nBaseball\nClover Stadium\nPomona, New York\n2011\n1\nSussex County Miners\nFrontier League\nBaseball\nSkylands Stadium\nAugusta, New Jersey\n2015\n1\nJersey Shore BlueClaws\nSouth Atlantic League\nBaseball\nShoreTown Ballpark\nLakewood, New Jersey\n2001\n3\nLong Island Nets\nNBA G League\nBasketball\nNassau Coliseum\nUniondale, New York\n2016\n0\nWestchester Knicks\nNBA G League\nBasketball\nWestchester County Center\nWhite Plains, New York\n2014\n0\nEmpire State Titans\nMinor League Cricket\nIdlewild Park\nQueens, New York\n2020\n0\nManhattan Yorkers\nMinor League Cricket\nMercer County Park\nWest Windsor, New Jersey\n2020\n0\nNew York Red Bulls II\nMLS Next Pro\nSoccer\nMSU Soccer Park at Pittser Field\nMontclair, New Jersey\n2015\n1\nNew York City FC II\nMLS Next Pro\nSoccer\nBelson Stadium\nQueens, New York\n2021\n0\nOther sports\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nTraditional games of New York City\nBoxing\n[\nedit\n]\nThe sport of\nboxing\ncame to the United States from England in the late 1700s and took root in the 1800s mainly in large urban areas such as Boston, New York City, and New Orleans.  Initially boxing was viewed as illegal and many fights and fighters operated in secrecy to avoid arrest.  The New York state legislature passed \u201cAn act to prevent Prize Fighting\u201d in 1859.\n[\n57\n]\nWith the law, the act of boxing was not illegal in itself, but fighting for prize money was against public decency.\nMost boxing matches of the early 1800s were conducted under the\nLondon Prize Ring Rules\n, which were based on a set of rules documented by English boxer\nJack Broughton\nin 1743.  A change in the rules occurred in the 1860s when\nWelsh\nsportsman\nJohn Graham Chambers\nwrote rules based on the use of padded gloves and got aristocrat and sportsman\nJohn Douglas\n, who held the title of the Marquess of Queensberry, to promote the\nMarquess of Queensberry Rules\n.  The new rules came into use in the United States in the 1880s.\n[\n58\n]\nJohn L. Sullivan\nbecame the first American heavyweight champion in 1882 under the bare-knuckle rules and again in 1892 he became the first heavyweight champion of the gloved era. Sullivan trained for his initial heavyweight championship in\nBelfast, New York\n.  By the end of the 19th century America was becoming the center of professional boxing. The sports economic incentive rose as popularity brought larger purses and commercial success.  Sullivan's championships initiated a period of over 100 years of American dominance in the heavyweight class.\n[\n59\n]\nBoxing was again being banned in America in the early 1900s, and was mostly outlawed in New York state. A loophole allowed fights to take place in athletic clubs, so many bars became on-the-fly athletic clubs in order to host matches.\n[\n60\n]\nThe\nWalker Law\n, passed in 1920, regulated boxing in the state of New York. The law reestablished legal boxing following the three-year ban created by the repeal of the\nFrawley Law\n.

Woodville Latham and his sons Otway and Gray Latham had invented the Eidoloscope projector, running very crudely like a film projector today. The Latham brothers had debuted test images to the press. But their real test of this device was to film something live and then display it a short time later.  So on May 4, 1895, the brothers filmed a boxing match on the rooftop of Madison Square Garden, then on 27rd Street and Madison Avenue.

It was considered the only golf course in Manhattan as the island is technically part of the borough.  Golf was played on\nGovernors Island\nfrom 1903 through 1996.  In 2006 over $1 million was spent to temporarily restore green complexes abandoned in 1996 and an 18-hole course was routed for a charity event that also promoted the island's opportunities.  The Manhattan Golf Classic was conducted in October of that year.  The event was billed as the \"first ever professional golf tournament in the history of New York City\", although\nFresh Meadow Country Club\n, when it was in\nQueens\nhad hosted two major championships in the 1930s, and\nVan Cortland Park\nGolf Course in\nThe Bronx\nand the Fox Hills Golf Course on\nStaten Island\nhad conducted professional events in the early 1900s.\nHorse racing\n[\nedit\n]\nAn extremely rare\nphoto finish\ntriple\ndead heat\n, recorded in a 1953\nharness race\nat Freehold Raceway\nHorse racing in the United States\ndates back to 1665, with the establishment of the New Market course in Salisbury, New York.

If you hear about a great lacrosse player, chances are that player has ties to Long Island.  In 2002 more than one-third (4 of 11) of the players on the\nNCAA Division I All-American First Team\ncame from Long Island high schools, with 16 Long Islanders honored overall.  In the same year, the NCAA Division II All-American list was virtually all Long Islanders and nearly every NCAA Division I, II and III lacrosse team had at least one player from the area.  In 2002 at the\nNCAA Division I championships\n, three of the four men's teams were coached by a Long Islander and all four had a Long Islander as a captain.\nBy some accounts, lacrosse was almost as big as baseball in New York City in the first decade of the 20th century. After learning the game in New York City and moving to Long Island, Jason Stranahan started the first high school lacrosse program at\nManhasset High School\nin 1933; football Hall of Famer\nJim Brown\nplayed lacrosse at Manhasset and is considered by some as the greatest lacrosse player of all time.   By the 1950s, the sport was embedded across Nassau County but had still failed to reach\nSuffolk County\n.\nHuntington High School\nfielded that county's first varsity team in 1957.   In the 1960s, there was a large migration to Long Island which resulted in high schools hiring a sizable number of teachers and coaches that coincidentally had college lacrosse backgrounds and the desire to build powerful programs.\n[\n88\n]\nThe\nNew York metropolitan area\nwas home to a\nMajor League Lacrosse\nteam called the\nNew York Lizards\n, formerly the Long Island Lizards, before that league\nmerged\nwith the\nPremier Lacrosse League\nin December 2020. The PLL plays a tour-based schedule, visiting a series of American and Canadian cities where the sport enjoys significant popularity; currently, the league's New York-area stop is Sports Illustrated Stadium. The\nNew Jersey Pride\n, also of the former MLL, played in\nPiscataway, New Jersey\nbut suspended operations after the 2008 season. The\nNew York Titans\nalso played in the New York area before moving to Orlando.

The prize, a massive silver cup from the Tiffany studio, known as the\nVanderbilt Cup\n, attracted top racers from Mercedes, Packard, and Fiat. The race took place on country roads with hundreds of spectators watching cars go by at speeds close to 100 miles per hour. In 1906, several spectators were killed when a car went off the road. Vanderbilt responded quickly by building a 45-mile private highway. Races resumed in 1908, but another accident killed spectators in 1910 making organizers abandon the Long Island course for good. The Vanderbilt Cup returned in 1936 and 1937 at\nRoosevelt Raceway\nin Westbury, Long Island. The 1937 race was one of the greatest races in New York State's history, featuring the only pre-WWII appearance of the German racing team in the United States. Legendary driver\nRalph DePalma\nserved as the honorary starter for the race where the starting signal came from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Hyde Park home via\nWestern Union Telegraph\n.\n[\n91\n]\nFrom 1953 until 1972\nstock car races\nwere held weekly from May until October at a 1/5th-mile asphalt racetrack on Staten Island.

He organized the first polo match in the United States at Dickel's Riding Academy at 39th Street and Fifth Avenue.  In the spring of 1876, a group of polo players established the first formal American polo club, the\nWestchester Polo Club\n, in New York.  On May 13, 1876, the\nJerome Park Racetrack\nin\nWestchester County\nwas the site of the first American outdoor polo match. The Westchester Polo Club alternated their playing seasons between New York and Rhode Island before making Newport their permanent home.\n[\n98\n]\nThe\nMeadowbrook Polo Club\nis among the most historic polo clubs in the United States with its roots dating back to 1877 when\nThomas Hitchcock Sr.\n, Oliver W. Bird,\nAugust Belmont\n, Benjamin Nicoll, and their associates participated in the first polo match on Long Island. The polo match was played on the infield of the racetrack of the Mineola Fair Grounds.  The Meadowbrook Polo Club, originally located in\nEast Meadow\nand\nJericho\nand currently located in\nOld Westbury\n, was formally incorporated in 1881.   The Meadowbrook Polo Club's first polo field was created in 1884, leading to Long Island's role as \"Polo Capital of the World\" during the 1920s and 1930s.\nBesides Meadowbrook other polo clubs in the area include: Equuleus Polo Club, Shannon Hill Polo Club,\nGreenwich Polo Club\n, Princeton University Polo, Fairfield County Hunt Club, North Fork Polo Club.

Amateurs also proliferated the area, and remain successful and influential in the sport, though professional rowing has been banned nationally for over a century because of corruption. Both college teams and clubs ply the traditionally popular\nHarlem River\nand other waters around the city. The Harlem River was the traditional\nrowing\ncourse for New York, analogous to the\nCharles River\nin\nBoston\nand the\nSchuylkill River\nin\nPhiladelphia\n.  On the Harlem's banks is the boathouse for the\nColumbia University\ncrew, and the river is the home course for the university's crew. Since 1952, a large flat rock face, called the \"(Big) C Rock\" has been painted with Columbia's varsity \"C\".\n[\n99\n]\nThe river is used by crews from\nNew York University\n,\nFordham University\n, and\nManhattan University\n, though the only university with permanent facilities currently on the river is Columbia. Formerly, a number of boathouses lined the Sherman Creek inlet off the river, but each was destroyed by suspected arson over the course of the 1970s. The last boathouse before the 1990's Peter Jay Sharp Boathouse to be on the creek was the Fordham Boathouse, which burned in 1977.\nRugby league\n[\nedit\n]\nThe city currently has one\nrugby league\nfootball club in the\nBrooklyn Kings RLFC\nwho play in the\nUSA Rugby League\n.

The main tournament consists of five championships: men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles and mixed doubles, with additional tournaments for junior and wheelchair players.\nThe National Tennis Center, open to the public whenever the USTA is not holding an event, features the world's largest stadium built specifically for the sport, the 22,547-seat\nArthur Ashe Stadium\n.\nThe\nNew York Empire\nbegan play in\nWorld TeamTennis\n(WTT) in 2016. Home matches were played at\nForest Hills Stadium\nin Queens.\nOther teams have represented the New York City metropolitan area in WTT in the past. The\nNew York Sets\n, who changed their name to New York Apples in 1977, were a charter franchise of the league and played from 1974 to 1978. The Sets originally played their home matches at\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nbefore splitting their home schedule between the Coliseum and\nMadison Square Garden\n. By the 1978 season, many home matches were played in the\nFelt Forum\nwith those featuring marquee opponents played in the Garden's main arena. The franchise won the league championship in 1976 and 1977, and featured star players\nBillie Jean King\n,\nVirginia Wade\n,\nSandy Mayer\nand\nPhil Dent\n. The two title-winning teams were coached by\nFred Stolle\n. Following the 1978 season, the Apples announced they were folding. Soon afterward, WTT suspended operations, and there were no 1979 or 1980 seasons.\nThe\nNew Jersey Stars\njoined WTT as an expansion franchise in 1987, playing their home matches in\nFranklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey\n. The team went 0\u201314 in its inaugural season but, with a completely remade roster, reached the TeamTennis Final in 1988. Home matches were moved to\nChatham Borough, New Jersey\nin 1989, when the team was led by\nTracy Austin\n. The signing of\nMartina Navratilova\nin 1994 produced immediate results on the court as the Stars won the league title in both 1994 and 1995. However, the team was unable to build a fan base and relocated, as two-time defending WTT champions, to become the Delaware Smash for the 1996 season.\nThe\nNew York Hamptons\nwere added as a WTT expansion franchise in 2000, playing their home matches in\nEast Quogue, New York\n. They moved to\nAmagansett\nin 2002. In 2003, Sportime NY became the team's majority owner. Home matches were moved to\nMamaroneck\nin\nWestchester County\n, and the team's name was changed to the New York Sportimes. Led by\nMartina Hingis\n, the Sportimes won the 2005 WTT title. In 2009, the Sportimes moved to New York City, playing their home matches on\nRandall's Island\n. Before the 2011 season, the Sportimes merged with the\nNew York Buzz\n, which had been based in the\nCapital District\nsince 1995. Following the merger, the team played some of its home matches on Randall's Island and others in either\nAlbany\nor\nTroy\n, New York. Following the 2013 season, the team was sold, and the new owner relocated it and renamed it the\nSan Diego Aviators\n. Ironically, the Aviators won their first league title after relocation in New York City at Forest Hills Stadium, which was selected as the site for the 2016 WTT Final to welcome the expansion\nNew York Empire\nto the league.\neSports\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nNew York Excelsior\n(NYXL) are an American professional\nOverwatch League\n(OWL) team representing New York City as one of 12 founding members of the Overwatch League.

Most of the athletic facilities are in Piscataway. The other two campuses of Rutgers, in\nCamden\nand\nNewark\n, have separate memberships in NCAA Division III.\nSports culture\n[\nedit\n]\nAlthough in much of the rest of the country\nAmerican football\nhas surpassed\nbaseball\nas the most popular professional sport, in New York, baseball arguably still stirs the most passion and interest. A championship win by any major sports team is considered to be worthy of the highest celebration, including a\nticker-tape parade\nfor the victorious team. In the past, ticker-tape parades have been held for the Yankees, Mets, Giants and Rangers. New Yorkers, however, tend to rally around any of the local teams who win (such as the\n1994 Stanley Cup champions New York Rangers\n, or the\n2007 New York Giants\n).\nRivalries\n[\nedit\n]\nDue to their geographic locations, New York has intense sports rivalries with the cities of\nBoston\n,\nPhiladelphia\n, and\nWashington, D.C.\nin addition to the natural rivalries that exist between the area\u2019s own teams.\nBoston\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nSports in Boston\n,\nYankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry\n,\nJets\u2013Patriots rivalry\n, and\nCeltics\u2013Knicks rivalry\nBoston and New York teams have the most intense, heated, and beefiest rivalries in all of American sports. Decades before professional baseball became popular, New York and Boston claimed distinctive versions of\nbat-and-ball games\n. A variant of baseball known as\nThe Massachusetts Game\nwas played in New England in the 1850s, while New York teams played by the\nKnickerbocker Rules\nset up by\nAlexander Cartwright\n. The New York rules eventually became the basis for the modern sport of baseball.\nTeams in Boston and New York offer some of the best rivalries in their respective sports. None are more famous, however, than the longtime feud between the\nNew York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox\nin\nMajor League Baseball\n. The viciousness and fierceness of the rivalry has led to the New York\u2013Boston rivalry being evident between the\nNew York Jets and the New England Patriots\nin the\nNational Football League\nand the\nNew York Knicks and the Boston Celtics\nin the\nNational Basketball Association\n.\n[\n109\n]\nThe\nNew York Rangers\nhave been longtime rivals with the\nBoston Bruins\nalso due to the fact that both teams are members of the\nNational Hockey League\n's\nOriginal Six\nfranchises, but this has been eclipsed by the\nMetropolitan Division\nrivalries in recent years.\nThe rivalry has also spread to other teams not in the same league, The\n1986 World Series\nbetween the\nNew York Mets\nand the\nBoston Red Sox\nis considered a classic especially the 6th game and the famous\nBill Buckner\nerror. The\nNew York Giants\nand\nNew England Patriots\nhave played two classic Super Bowls:\nSuper Bowl XLII\nwhich features the\nHelmet Catch\nand\nSuper Bowl XLVI\n, There is also a rivalry between the\nBoston Celtics\nand the\nBrooklyn Nets\n. While\nMajor League Soccer\nhas two teams in the New York area and one in the Boston area, the\nrivalry\nbetween\nNew York City FC\nand the\nNew York Red Bulls\novershadows either team's rivalry with the\nNew England Revolution\n.\nPhiladelphia\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nSports in Philadelphia\n,\nMets\u2013Phillies rivalry\n,\nEagles\u2013Giants rivalry\n,\nFlyers\u2013Rangers rivalry\n,\nFlyers\u2013Islanders rivalry\n, and\nDevils\u2013Flyers rivalry\nIn each of the four sports leagues, as well as Major League Soccer, there is intra-division competition between teams from New York and Philadelphia, as seen in the rivalries between the\nNew York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies\nin\nMajor League Baseball\n, the\nNew York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles\nin the\nNational Football League\n, and the\nNew York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers\nin the\nNational Hockey League\n.\n[\n110\n]\nThere is also a rivalry between the\nBrooklyn Nets\nand the\nPhiladelphia 76ers\nof the\nNational Basketball Association\n, although it is not as intense as the other three rivalries. There is another rivalry between the\nNew York Knicks\nand the\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n. As in the case of Boston, the rivalries between New York City FC and the New York Red Bulls with the\nPhiladelphia Union\nhave a lower profile than that of the two New York-area teams.\nIn the first season of the\nOverwatch League\nthe\nPhiladelphia Fusion\nwas the first team to beat the previously undefeated\nNew York Excelsior\nin regular season play. Excelsior was a strong team throughout the season, bringing home two of the four stage titles and entering the post-season playoffs at the highest seed. However, in a surprise upset Philadelphia knocked New York out of the playoffs and went on to come in second place in the finals as both the first and last team to defeat New York in the 2018 season.\n[\n111\n]\nThe metropolitan area's three NHL teams tend to be primary rivals with one another, although they each have their own rivalry with the\nFlyers\n. Unlike baseball and football, the local teams in the New York area are in the same division and are therefore in direct competition with one another.\nWashington, D.C.\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nSports in Washington, D.C.\n;\nCommanders\u2013Giants rivalry\n;\nCapitals\u2013Rangers rivalry\n;\nCapitals\u2013Islanders rivalry\n; and\nAtlantic Cup (Major League Soccer)\nSports teams in New York City and\nWashington, D.C.\nhave long been strong rivals. The prominence of each city in America's media landscape has helped increase the notoriety of these rivalries, as has the fact that many teams in each city play in the same division.\nThe most historic sports rivalry between teams of these two cities is the\nrivalry\nbetween the\nNew York Giants\nand the\nWashington Commanders\nin the\nNational Football League\n. Both teams play in the\nEastern division\nof the\nNational Football Conference\n, meaning that they play against each other twice every regular season. Both teams are among the oldest and most successful in professional football. Their rivalry goes back to 1932, and has included some of the game's greatest players and coaches throughout the decades.\nIn addition, two of the\nNational Hockey League\n's teams based in the New York metropolitan areas (the\nNew York Rangers\nand\nNew York Islanders\n) have developed passionate rivalries with the\nWashington Capitals\n, as all three compete in the\nMetropolitan Division\nof the\nEastern Conference\n. Both the\nCapitals\u2013Rangers rivalry\nand\nCapitals\u2013Islanders rivalry\nhave increased in intensity over the decades as a result of highly competitive playoff matchups in addition to regular season encounters. The\nNew Jersey Devils\nalso play in the Metropolitan Division and are a division rival for the Capitals, though this rivalry is not as historic and intense as the ones with the two New York-based teams.\nThere is also a historic rivalry between the\nNew York Red Bulls\nand\nD.C. United\nof\nMajor League Soccer\n. Both teams are two of the oldest and most historic teams in the league, and their rivalry dates back to 1996, the league's inaugural season. Both teams play in the\nEastern Conference\n. Their rivalry is known as the\nAtlantic Cup\n, which is also the name of the trophy awarded to the team that wins the matchup.\nThe\nWashington Nationals\nand\nNew York Mets\nof\nMajor League Baseball\nalso share a rivalry. Though this rivalry is not as historic as the others mentioned here, the two compete in the\nNL East\n. This has naturally helped create a rivalry between the two teams since the Nationals moved to Washington, D.C., in 2005.\nOlympic bids\n[\nedit\n]\nNew York and\nLos Angeles\nsubmitted bids to the\nUSOC\nfor the\n1984 Summer Olympics\n. The USOC voted to submit Los Angeles' bid to the\nIOC\n, which was the only bid for those games. While Los Angeles secured the right to host the 1984 Summer Olympics, New York served as host of the\n1984 Summer Paralympics\n.\n[\n112\n]\nIn 2005, New York City\nbid\nto host the\n2012 Summer Olympics\n, but lost to London. It was the first time the\nUSOC\nsubmitted a bid from New York City to the IOC. Upon the USOC reaching a new revenue-sharing agreement with the\nIOC\nin May 2012, New York was mentioned as a potential candidate for the\n2024 Summer Olympics\n,\n[\n113\n]\n[\n114\n]\nbut the city declined to submit a bid to the USOC.\nLos Angeles\nwas selected as the American candidate for the 2024 Olympics and ultimately secured the right to host the\n2028 Summer Olympics\n.\nSports media\n[\nedit\n]\nNewspapers such as\nThe New York Times\nand the\nNew York Post\nhave lengthy sports sections.

The Islanders compete in the\nNational Hockey League\n(NHL) as a member of the\nMetropolitan Division\nin the\nEastern Conference\n. The team plays its home games at\nUBS Arena\n. The Islanders are one of three NHL franchises in the\nNew York metropolitan area\n, along with the\nNew Jersey Devils\nand\nNew York Rangers\n, and their fanbase resides primarily on\nLong Island\n.\nThe team was founded in\n1972\nas part of the NHL's maneuvers to keep a team from rival league\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) out of the newly built\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nin suburban\nUniondale, New York\n. After two years of building up the team's roster, they found almost instant success by securing 14 straight playoff berths starting with their third season. The Islanders won four consecutive\nStanley Cup\nchampionships between\n1980\nand\n1983\n, the eighth of nine\ndynasties\nrecognized by the NHL in its history. Their 19 consecutive playoff series wins between 1980 and 1984 is a feat that remains unparalleled in the history of professional sports. They are the last team in any major professional North American sport to win four consecutive championships, and to date the last NHL team to achieve a\nthree-peat\n.\nFollowing the team's dynasty era, the franchise ran into problems with money, ownership and management, an aging arena, and low attendance. Their woes were reflected on the ice, as the team has not won a division title since\n1987\u201388\n, and went 22 seasons without winning a playoff series prior to the\n2016 playoffs\n. After years of failed attempts to rebuild or replace Nassau Coliseum in suburban Long Island, the Islanders relocated to\nBarclays Center\nin Brooklyn following the\n2014\u201315 season\n.\n[\n4\n]\nIn the\n2018\u201319\nand\n2019\u201320\nseasons, the Islanders split their home games between Barclays Center and Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders played all their home games in the\n2020\u201321 season\nat Nassau Coliseum. Their\nnew arena\nnear\nBelmont Park\nwas opened in 2021.\nTen former members of the Islanders have been inducted into the\nHockey Hall of Fame\n, seven of whom\u2014\nMike Bossy\n,\nClark Gillies\n,\nDenis Potvin\n,\nBilly Smith\n,\nBryan Trottier\n, coach\nAl Arbour\n, and general manager\nBill Torrey\n\u2014were members of all four Cup-winning teams. Post-dynasty players\nPat LaFontaine\n,\nRoberto Luongo\nand\nPierre Turgeon\nwere also inducted.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe NHL heads to Long Island (1972\u20131974)\n[\nedit\n]\nIn fall 1972, the emerging\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) planned to place its New York team, the\nNew York Raiders\n, in\nNassau County\n's brand-new\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\n.\n[\n5\n]\nCounty officials did not consider the WHA a major league and wanted to keep the Raiders out.\n[\n6\n]\nWilliam Shea\n, who had helped bring\nMajor League Baseball\n's\nNew York Mets\nto the area a decade earlier, was enlisted to bring an NHL team to Long Island. Although Shea had previously worked with upstart rival leagues including the aborted\nContinental League\n, the\nAmerican Football League\nand the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n, his ultimate goal in these efforts had always been to try to persuade the established leagues to grant second franchises to New York as had been the case with the Mets (and also with the\nNew York Jets\nand\nNew York Nets\n, as a result of those teams' leagues merging with their established rivals).\nWilliam Shea\nplayed a major role in bringing a hockey team to Long Island.\nIn contrast, Shea decided there was no need to work with the WHA since unlike the initial results of his previous approaches to established leagues in the other major sports, Shea immediately found NHL president\nClarence Campbell\nto be receptive to adding a second team in New York. Nevertheless, the Islanders' bid faced opposition from the\nNew York Rangers\n, who did not want additional competition in the New York area.\n[\n7\n]\nEventually, Campbell and Shea persuaded the Rangers' owners,\nMadison Square Garden\n, to reconsider. Rangers' president\nBill Jennings\nweighed pros and cons. Another local NHL team would be compelled to compensate the Rangers for sharing the New York area. On the other hand, a WHA team would owe the Rangers nothing unless it was included in a potential NHL\u2013WHA merger, a prospect to which both Campbell and Jennings were adamantly opposed. Finally, consenting to the establishment of an NHL franchise in suburban Nassau County would help to ensure the vast majority of the Rangers' fanbase within New York City proper would continue to support the older franchise, and reduced the prospect of a rival league eventually establishing a team and fanbase there. Perhaps remembering the crucial role the Jets had played in ensuring the success of the AFL just a few years earlier as a challenger of the\nNational Football League\n, Jennings decided to help bring a new NHL team to the New York metropolitan area.\n[\n8\n]\nDespite expanding to 14 teams just two years prior, the NHL awarded a\nLong Island\n-based franchise to clothing manufacturer\nRoy Boe\n, owner of the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n's\nNew York Nets\n, on November 8, 1971.\n[\n8\n]\nThe terms included $6\u00a0million ($45.1\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) franchise fee plus a $5\u00a0million ($37.59\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) territorial fee to the Rangers.\n[\n10\n]\nAn expansion franchise was also given to\nAtlanta\n(the\nFlames\n) to keep the schedule balanced and to prevent the WHA from entering the growing market at the newly built\nOmni Coliseum\n.\n[\n7\n]\nThe New York Islanders name was unveiled by the franchise on February 15, 1972, at a\npress conference\nheld across the street from\nRoosevelt Raceway\nat a restaurant owned by\nBurt Bacharach\n.\n[\n11\n]\nMany expected it to use the \"\nLong Island Ducks\n\", after the\nEastern Hockey League\nteam that played from 1959 to 1973.\n[\n12\n]\nThe team was soon nicknamed the \"Isles\" by the local newspapers. The Islanders' arrival effectively doomed the Raiders, who played in Madison Square Garden under difficult lease terms and were forced to move to\nCherry Hill, New Jersey\nin the middle of their second season.\n[\n6\n]\nFormer\nCalifornia Golden Seals\nexecutive vice president\nBill Torrey\nwas named as the team's general manager at the same press conference as the franchise's name unveiling.\n[\n11\n]\nThe Islanders secured veteran forward\nEd Westfall\n, defenseman\nGerry Hart\n, and goaltender\nBilly Smith\nin the\n1972 expansion draft\n, along with\njunior ice hockey\nstars\nBilly Harris\n,\nLorne Henning\n, and\nBobby Nystrom\nin the\n1972 amateur draft\n.\n[\n13\n]\nSoon after the draft,\nPhil Goyette\nwas named as the team's first head coach, however he was fired halfway through the season and replaced with\nEarl Ingarfield\nand assistant coach\nAut Erickson\n.\n[\n14\n]\nUnlike most other expansion teams' general managers, Torrey made few trades for veteran players in the early years, as he was committed to building the team through the draft. Torrey stated, \"I told the owners that we're not going to beat this team next door by taking the castoffs from others teams. We'd have to develop our own stars.\"\n[\n13\n]\nBefore the season began, Westfall was named the team's first captain.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\nBy September 1972, the Islanders were waiting for the Nassau Coliseum to be completed as well as their practice facility \"The Royal Ice Rink\" in\nKings Park\n. The team was forced to practice as late as October 6, the day before their first game, at the Rangers practice rink in\nNew Hyde Park\n.\n[\n17\n]\nThe Islanders' first win came on October 12, 1972, in a 3\u20132 game against the\nLos Angeles Kings\n.\n[\n14\n]\nIn the team's first season, young players such as Smith, Nystrom, and Henning (all of whom would be part of the Islanders dynasty of the early 1980s) were given chances to prove themselves in the NHL. The young and inexperienced expansion team, however, posted a record of 12\u201360\u20136, setting an NHL record for most losses and worst overall record in a season.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n18\n]\nA highlight occurred on January 18, 1973, when they defeated the defending\nStanley Cup\nchampion\nBoston Bruins\n9\u20137.\n[\n14\n]\nFinishing last in the standings that season, they received the right to select first in the\n1973 draft\n.\n[\n18\n]\nOff the ice, the Islanders struggled financially, a situation that was exacerbated by the then-unprecedented $11 million in franchise and territorial fees.\nMontreal Canadiens\n' general manager\nSam Pollock\nwas keen to acquire the Islanders' pick so he could draft French Canadian junior star defenseman\nDenis Potvin\n, who had been touted as \"the next\nBobby Orr\n\" when he was 14 years old. Pollock made several lucrative trade offers including cash to the Islanders, but Torrey turned the Canadiens down and selected Potvin with the first overall pick.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n19\n]\nDuring the off-season, Torrey convinced former\nSt. Louis Blues\ncoach\nAl Arbour\nto come coach the Islanders.\n[\n8\n]\nEven with Arbour as the team's head coach and Potvin, who won the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\nas NHL Rookie of the Year, the team again finished last in the\nEast Division\nduring the\n1973\u201374 season\n, but allowed 100 fewer goals than the previous season. The season included their first win against the Rangers, on October 27, 1973,\n[\n5\n]\nwhich also happened to be the game where Potvin scored his first NHL goal. Although they failed to make the playoffs, their 56 points represented a 26-point improvement from the previous season.\n[\n8\n]\nAscendancy and playoff inability (1974\u20131979)\n[\nedit\n]\nDenis Potvin\nled the Islanders to playoff success in the 1970s and 1980s.\nWith the 4th and 22nd picks in the\n1974 draft\n, the Islanders added young forwards\nClark Gillies\nand\nBryan Trottier\nto continue Torrey's building plan.\n[\n20\n]\nIn the\n1974\u201375 season\n, the Islanders made one of the biggest turnarounds in NHL history. Led by Potvin, forwards Westfall, Harris, Nystrom, Gillies, and goaltenders Smith and\nGlenn \"Chico\" Resch\n, the team earned 88 points, 32 more than the previous season and two more than their first two seasons combined, earning their first playoff berth. They defeated the rival\nNew York Rangers\nin a best-of-3 first-round series as\nJ. P. Parise\nscored just 11 seconds into overtime of the third game.\n[\n8\n]\nIn the next round, down three games to none in a best-of-seven series against the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, the Islanders rallied to win the next four and take the series-winning game 7 on a late third-period goal by Westfall. Only four other major North American professional sports teams have accomplished this feat (the\n1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs\n,\n2004 Boston Red Sox\n, the\n2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers\n, and the\n2013\u201314 Los Angeles Kings\n).\n[\n21\n]\nThey were close but not as lucky in the following round, rallying from another 3\u20130 deficit to force a seventh game against the defending\nStanley Cup\nchampion\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nbefore the Flyers took the decisive seventh game at home and went on to win the Cup again.\n[\n8\n]\nDespite a disappointing playoff finish, Arbour remained complimentary of the team's attitude and maturity, saying \"If I called a practice next week, every one of them would show up.\"\n[\n22\n]\nThe Islanders continued their climb up the standings in\n1975\u201376\n, earning 101 points and the fifth-best record in the league.\n[\n23\n]\nIt was the first 100-point season in Islanders history, in only their fourth year of existence.\n[\n24\n]\nRookie center Trottier finished the season with 95 points and won the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n; his points and assists (63) totals set a new league record for most in each category by a rookie.\n[\n25\n]\nIt would be the first of four consecutive 100-point seasons, including the first two division titles in franchise history.\n[\n24\n]\n[\n26\n]\nDespite the emergence of young star players and regular season success between 1976 and 1979 the Islanders suffered a series of playoff disappointments. In\n1976\nand\n1977 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, the Islanders were knocked out in the semifinals by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the\nMontreal Canadiens\n.\n[\n27\n]\nThe Canadiens posted a 24\u20133 record in the playoffs during those two seasons with all three losses coming at the hands of the Islanders.\n[\n28\n]\nMike Bossy\nwas selected with the 15th overall pick in\n1977\nand became the third Islander to win the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n.\nIn the\n1977 draft\n, Torrey had the 15th overall pick and was deciding between forwards\nMike Bossy\nand\nDwight Foster\n. Bossy was known as an emerging scorer who lacked physicality. Foster was known as a solid\nchecker\nwith marginal offensive ability (despite having led the\nOntario Hockey League\nin scoring). Arbour persuaded Torrey to pick Bossy, arguing it was easier to teach a scorer how to check.\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nIn the\n1977\u201378 season\n, Bossy became the third Islander to win the Calder Trophy, and scored 53 goals that season, a rookie record at the time.\n[\n8\n]\nThe team earned their first Patrick Division and Campbell Conference championships.\n[\n14\n]\nSix players finished the season with 30 goals scored or more, with five of them Islanders draft picks, showing the success of the draft building process.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n31\n]\nThe season ended with a familiar result in the\nplayoffs\n, as the team lost in overtime in game 7 of the quarterfinals against the\nToronto Maple Leafs\n.\n[\n29\n]\nIn\n1978\u201379\n, the team finished with the best record in the NHL, clinching it with three goals in the third period of the season's final game against the Rangers. Trottier won the\nHart Memorial Trophy\nas league MVP and captured the\nArt Ross Trophy\nfor the most points, while sophomore Bossy scored 69 goals, which also led the league. Despite their regular season dominance, the Islanders exited the playoffs with another upset playoff loss, this time to the Rangers in the semifinals. As the team was leaving\nMadison Square Garden\nfollowing their game 6 elimination, Rangers fans rocked and threw objects at the team's bus. Hockey professionals and journalists generally questioned whether the Islanders were capable of winning the important games needed to win a Stanley Cup championship. Islander players would cite fear of repeating the pain of this loss as spurring their later success. After transferring the captaincy to Gillies the season before, Westfall retired and shortly thereafter became a color commentator on the team's telecasts.\nOff the ice, the Islanders were on shaky ground. Boe was losing money on both his franchises, even as the Islanders quickly surged to NHL prominence and the Nets became an ABA power. The Islanders were still far behind on the $10\u00a0million they had paid in startup costs, and the expansion and territorial fees associated with moving the Nets to the\nNational Basketball Association\nthrew Boe's finances into a tailspin. Eventually, Boe was forced to sell both his teams. He readily found a buyer for the Nets, but had less luck finding one for the Islanders. Torrey orchestrated a sale to one of the team's limited partners,\nJohn Pickett\n. In return, Pickett promoted Torrey to team president, though Torrey had already been operating head of the franchise before then. Soon after purchasing the team, Pickett signed a very lucrative\ncable television\ncontract with the fledgling\nSportsChannel\nnetwork as their owner,\nCharles Dolan\n, thought the up-and-coming Islanders would be a perfect centerpiece for his new network. Dolan gave Pickett a long-term guaranteed contract intended not only to keep the team on Long Island, but give area governments an incentive to renew his cable contracts. The Islanders have remained on the network, now known as\nMSG Sportsnet\n, for over four decades.\nThe Dynasty (1979\u20131983)\n[\nedit\n]\nAfter the Islanders' regular season dominance and playoff disappointment in 1979, Arbour decided that he would no longer concern himself too greatly with his team's finish in the regular season. Instead, he focused his team's energy on how they would perform in the playoffs. In\n1980\n, the Islanders dropped below the 100-point mark for the first time in five years, earning only 91 points. However, they finally broke through and won the\nStanley Cup\n.\nBefore the\n1980\nplayoffs, the Islanders acquired\nButch Goring\nfrom the\nLos Angeles Kings\n. Goring's arrival was often called the \"final piece of the puzzle.\"\nBefore the playoffs, Torrey made the difficult decision to trade longtime and popular veterans Billy Harris and defenseman\nDave Lewis\nto the\nLos Angeles Kings\nfor second line center\nButch Goring\n. Goring's arrival is often called the \"final piece of the puzzle\",\n[\n32\n]\na strong two-way player, his presence on the second line ensured that opponents would no longer be able to focus their defensive efforts on the Islanders' first line of Bossy, Trottier and\nClark Gillies\n. Contributions from new teammates, such as wingers\nDuane Sutter\nand\nAnders Kallur\nand\nstay-at-home defensemen\nDave Langevin\n,\nGord Lane\n, and\nKen Morrow\n(the latter fresh off a gold medal win at the\n1980 Olympics\n), also figured prominently in the Islanders' playoff success.\nIn the playoffs, the Islanders defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3\u20131 in the preliminary round, then beat the Boston Bruins 4\u20131 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, the Islanders faced the\nBuffalo Sabres\n, who had finished second overall in the NHL standings. The Islanders won the first two games in Buffalo, including a 2\u20131 victory in game two on\nBob Nystrom\n's goal in double overtime. They went on to win the series in six games and reach the finals for the first time in franchise history, where they would face the NHL's regular season champions, the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, who had gone undefeated for 35 straight games (25\u20130\u201310) during the regular season. In game one in\nPhiladelphia\n, the Islanders won 4\u20133 on\nDenis Potvin\n's power-play goal in overtime. Leading the series 3\u20132, they went home to Long Island for game six. In that game the Islanders blew a 4\u20132 lead in the third period but Nystrom continued his overtime heroics, scoring at 7:11 of the extra frame, on assists by John Tonelli and Lorne Henning, to bring Long Island its first Stanley Cup championship. This was the most recent Stanley Cup-clinching game won in overtime by the home team until the Los Angeles Kings did it in 2014. It was also the Islanders' sixth overtime victory of the playoffs. Bryan Trottier won the\nConn Smythe Trophy\nas the most valuable player in the playoffs. Torrey's strategy of building through the draft turned out very well; nearly all of the major contributors on the 1980 champions were home-grown Islanders or had spent most of their NHL careers in the Islanders organization. The Islanders were the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup with Europeans (\nStefan Persson\nand Kallur) on its roster.\n[\n33\n]\nThe Islanders dominated the next two seasons. Bossy scored\n50 goals in 50 games\nin\n1981\nand the Islanders lost only three playoff games en route to defeating the\nMinnesota North Stars\nin five games to win the Stanley Cup. Goring won the Conn Smythe Trophy. During their semifinals sweep of the Rangers, Islander fans began taunting the Rangers with a chant of \"\n1940!\n\"\u00a0\u2013 referring to the Rangers' last Stanley Cup win in\n1940\n(the Rangers would not win the cup again until\n1994\n). Fans in other NHL cities soon picked up the chant.\n[\n34\n]\nThese four banners hung in\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nand represent the four\nStanley Cup\nchampionships the Islanders won from 1980 through 1983.\nIn\n1981\u201382\n, the Islanders won a then-record 15 straight games en route to a franchise-record 118 points, while\nMike Bossy\nset a scoring record for right-wingers with 147 points in an 80-game schedule. The Islanders finished with the most points in the league (118), yet once in the playoffs against the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nthey found themselves down late in the third period of deciding game 5 before\nJohn Tonelli\nscored both the tying goal and the overtime winner. After defeating the Rangers in six games they swept both the\nQuebec Nordiques\nand the\nVancouver Canucks\nin the first-ever coast-to-coast\nStanley Cup Finals\nfor their third straight championship. During that series Bossy, upended by a check from\nTiger Williams\nand falling parallel to the ice, managed to hook the puck with his stick and score. Bossy netted the Stanley Cup-winning goal and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nThe next year, although the Islanders had won the Stanley Cup three straight times, more attention was being paid to the upstart\nEdmonton Oilers\n, whose young superstar\nWayne Gretzky\nhad just shattered existing scoring records.\n[\n35\n]\nIn\n1982\u201383\nthe Oilers had a better regular season, but the Islanders swept them in the\nStanley Cup Finals\nto win their fourth straight championship.\nBilly Smith\nwas named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner after shutting down the Oilers' vaunted scoring machine. Gretzky failed to score a goal during the series.\n[\n36\n]\nDuane and\nBrent Sutter\nscored seven and five points respectively in the first three games, while Bossy again scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in game four. After that game, the Oilers players walked past the Islanders' dressing room and were surprised to see the champions exhausted. Oilers players such as Gretzky and\nMark Messier\nsaid that they realized at that moment how much it would actually take to win the Stanley Cup.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\nPost-dynasty and the Easter Epic (1983\u20131991)\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders finished the\n1983\u201384 regular season\ntied atop the Prince of Wales Conference while successfully defending their Patrick Division title. The \"Drive for Five\" got off to a tense start. Late in the deciding game of their first-round series against the Rangers,\nDon Maloney\ntied the game with a controversial goal as the Islanders believed Maloney's stick was too high. They ultimately eliminated the Rangers for the fourth consecutive year. The team then defeated the\nWashington Capitals\nin five games and the\nMontreal Canadiens\nin six to set up a finals rematch with the Oilers. The series featured rookie\nPat LaFontaine\nscoring two third-period goals in 38 seconds. This time, the Oilers dethroned the Islanders to win the first of what would be five Stanley Cup victories in seven years. For the\n1984 playoffs\n, the NHL changed the home and away schedule for the finals, which provided the Islanders home-ice advantage in the series based on Wales Conference teams collectively having a winning record in regular season games versus Campbell Conference opponents,\n[\n38\n]\ndespite finishing lower than them in the overall standings. The new format had them play three straight games in Edmonton, where the Oilers managed to lock up the series, after the teams had split the first two games in New York. Bossy cited the team's hard time winning an away game as their downfall in the series.\n[\n39\n]\nThe Oilers also ended the Islanders' 19-series playoff winning streak. It remains the longest streak in the history of professional sports (one more than the 1959\u20131967 streak by the\nBoston Celtics\nof the NBA). Unlike the 1976\u20131979 Montreal Canadiens, who needed to win three series in the 1976 and 1977 playoffs under the playoff format in place at that time, the Islanders had to win four series in each of their Stanley Cup seasons.\nThe Islanders remained competitive for the rest of the decade, even as some of the stars from the Cup teams departed. As the decade wore on, Pickett began to keep the money from the team's cable deal rather than reinvest it in the team as he had done in years past. Although it did not become clear immediately, the lack of funds limited Torrey's ability to replace all of the departing talent. In the\n1984\u201385 NHL season\n, the Islanders slipped to third in their division, followed by similar results in the\n1985\u201386\nand\n1986\u201387\nseasons. They began facing stiff competition from division rivals, the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, who eliminated the Islanders in the division finals in 1985 and 1987, and the Capitals, who swept the Islanders' 1986 first-round series, the team's first exit without winning a playoff round since 1978.\nKelly Hrudey\n(pictured in 2006) saved 73 of 75 shots in the \"\nEaster Epic\n\" for the Islanders, who came out victorious after four periods of overtime play.\nIn 1986, Nystrom retired due to a serious injury\n[\n40\n]\nand\nClark Gillies\nwas picked up on waivers by the\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\n[\n41\n]\nArbour retired as coach following the\n1985\u201386 season\nand was replaced by longtime junior hockey coach\nTerry Simpson\n.\n[\n42\n]\nDuring the first round of the\n1987 playoffs\nagainst the Capitals, the Islanders had fallen behind in the series three games to one but were not eliminated due to a playoff format change from a best-of-5 series to a best-of-7.\n[\n43\n]\nThe Islanders evened the series, which set the stage for one of the most famous games in NHL history: the \"\nEaster Epic\n\".\nKelly Hrudey\nstopped 73 shots on goal while Pat LaFontaine scored at 8:47 of the fourth overtime\u2014and at 1:56\u00a0a.m. on\nEaster Sunday\nmorning. The win came even though the Islanders had been outshot 75\u201352.\n[\n44\n]\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\nThey were eliminated in the division finals in seven games by the Flyers.\n[\n47\n]\nChronic back pain forced\nMike Bossy\nto retire after the season.\n[\n48\n]\nThe\nfollowing season\n, the Islanders captured another division title,\n[\n49\n]\nbut were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the upstart\nNew Jersey Devils\n.\n[\n50\n]\nPotvin retired after the playoffs, holding records for most career goals (310), assists (742) and points (1052) by a defenseman, though he has since been passed in these categories by\nRay Bourque\nand\nPaul Coffey\n. Around this time, the team's run of good luck in the draft began to run out. Of their four top draft picks from 1987 to 1990, they lost one to a freak knee injury and two others never panned out.\n[\n51\n]\nThe\n1988\u201389 season\nsaw the Islanders win only seven of their first 27 games. Torrey fired Simpson and brought Arbour back. Arbour was unable to turn things around, and the team finished with 61 points, tied with the\nQuebec Nordiques\nfor the worst record in the league. It was their first losing season and the first time missing the playoffs since their second season. Smith, the last remaining original Islanders player, retired after the season to become the team's goaltending coach. Not long after the end of the season, Pickett moved to Florida and turned day-to-day operations over to a committee of four Long Island entrepreneurs: Ralph Palleschi, Bob Rosenthal,\nStephen Walsh\n, and\nPaul Greenwood\n. In return, they each bought a 2.5% interest in the team.\n[\n51\n]\nIn the\nnext season\n, the Islanders rebounded to get back into the playoffs, but fell to the Rangers in five games of the opening round. The team bought out the remaining years of\nBryan Trottier\n's contract, sending him off with a team record of games played. The\n1990\u201391 season\nhad the team finish well out of the playoffs after winning only 25 games.\nNew faces and the 1993 run (1991\u20131995)\n[\nedit\n]\nLaFontaine was frustrated with the team's lack of success and the progress of his contract negotiations, and held out rather than report to camp before\n1991\u201392\n. In response to the holdout, Torrey engineered a rebuilding project with two blockbuster trades on October 25, 1991. He dealt LaFontaine,\nRandy Wood\nand\nRandy Hillier\n(along with future considerations) to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin return for\nPierre Turgeon\n,\nBenoit Hogue\n,\nUwe Krupp\nand\nDave McLlwain\n. He also sent longtime captain\nBrent Sutter\nand\nBrad Lauer\nto the\nChicago Blackhawks\nfor\nSteve Thomas\nand\nAdam Creighton\n. With these additions and a talented core of players such as\nDerek King\n,\nRay Ferraro\n, and\nPatrick Flatley\n, along with incoming\nSoviet\nplayers\nVladimir Malakhov\nand\nDarius Kasparaitis\n, the Islanders had a new foundation in the early 1990s. The management committee, however, was not nearly as patient as Boe and Pickett had been, and forced Torrey to resign after the Islanders missed the playoffs again that season. Assistant general manager\nDon Maloney\nwas hired in Torrey's place,\n[\n51\n]\nwhile Torrey quickly resurfaced with the expansion\nFlorida Panthers\n.\nIn Maloney's first year,\n1992\u201393\n, the Islanders rebounded to make the playoffs, in the process surpassing the 80-point mark for the first time in five years. The LaFontaine-Turgeon trade proved successful for both the Islanders and Sabres, as both players hit career highs in points and Turgeon won the\nLady Byng Trophy\n.\nRay Ferraro emerged as a playoff hero, scoring a pair of overtime winners in the first-round series against the Capitals. Instead of celebrating after winning game 6 at Nassau Coliseum, however, the Islanders were both irate and despondent. Only seconds after Turgeon, the team's star center and leading scorer, scored an insurance goal in the series-clinching game,\nDale Hunter\nviolently checked him from behind. Turgeon was believed to be out for the entire second round, if not longer, with a separated shoulder. He returned only for spot power-play duty in the last game of the second round. Hunter received a 21-game suspension, at the time the longest for on-ice misconduct in modern NHL history.\nThe Islanders' next opponent, the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, were twice-defending Stanley Cup champions and full of stars such as\nMario Lemieux\n,\nJaromir Jagr\n, and\nRon Francis\n. The Penguins had roared through the regular season with 119 points, as well as recording a record 17 consecutive wins towards the end of the season, and were overwhelmingly favored to win a third straight championship. Jim Smith of\nNewsday\npredicted that with Turgeon on the sidelines, the Penguins would sweep the Islanders out of the playoffs, however on the strength of outstanding goaltending from\nGlenn Healy\nand contributions from all four lines, the Islanders achieved a huge upset when\nDavid Volek\nscored at 5:16 of overtime of the deciding seventh game.\nNewsday'\ns front page the day following the win was a picture of Healy with a headline reading, \"It's a Miracle!\" This was the last playoff series won by the Islanders for 23 years, until the 2015\u201316 season. Turgeon returned to the Islanders' top line for the conference finals against the\nMontreal Canadiens\n, though he was not in peak form as he had not fully recovered. The Islanders bowed out of the playoffs after a hard-fought five games, two of which went to overtime. After beating the Islanders, the Canadiens went on to win the Cup.\nMaloney had avoided making many personnel changes his first year, but on the eve of the\n1993 expansion draft\nhe traded backup goaltender\nMark Fitzpatrick\nto the\nQuebec Nordiques\nfor\nRon Hextall\n. The clubs also exchanged first-round picks in the deal. Able to protect only one netminder in the expansion draft, the Islanders left Healy exposed. He was claimed by the\nMighty Ducks of Anaheim\n, then was claimed by the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nin Phase II of the draft the next day, and finally had his rights traded to the Rangers, where he became the backup.\nThe Islanders barely squeezed past the Panthers to make the 1994 playoffs before being swept in a lopsided opening series by the first-place Rangers, who went on to win the Cup. It would be the Islanders' last playoff appearance until\n2002\n. Arbour retired for good as coach and was succeeded by longtime assistant\nLorne Henning\n. Hextall, who allowed 16 goals in three games, drew most of the criticism for the failed playoff campaign and was shipped to Philadelphia for\nTommy Soderstrom\nin September. In the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season, the Islanders not only failed to qualify for the playoffs, they finished ahead of only the third-year\nOttawa Senators\n.\nManagement issues (1995\u20132000)\n[\nedit\n]\nBy the end of the 1994\u201395 season, Maloney was under considerable heat from the press and fan base for his handling of the team. Since taking over in 1992, the only noticeable attempt he made to upgrade the roster was the acquisition of Hextall. Near the end of the failed 1995 campaign, Maloney decided that the core of players he had left alone for three seasons needed to be revamped, leading to a rebuilding project. He traded Turgeon and Malakhov to the\nMontreal Canadiens\nfor\nKirk Muller\nand\nMathieu Schneider\n, while Hogue was sent to\nToronto\nfor young goaltender\nEric Fichaud\n. Additionally, Maloney allowed the team's leading scorer, Ferraro, to depart as an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of the season. Fans' displeasure at Maloney for trading the popular Turgeon was magnified when Muller balked at joining a rebuilding team. He played 45 games for the Islanders before being sent to Toronto as well.\nBefore the\n1995\u201396 season\n, Maloney fired Henning and named\nMike Milbury\nhead coach. The same year, the Islanders' attempt at updating their look resulted in the unveiling of a new team logo of a slicker-clad fisherman holding a hockey stick. Islanders fans disliked it, and rival Rangers' fans mockingly called the Islanders \"\nfishsticks\n\"\u2014mocking how the logo resembled the\nGorton's Fisherman\n. The team reverted to a modified version of the old logo as soon as the league allowed them to do so. (In spite of this, the logo found renewed popularity as a throwback design in the late 2010s and early 2020s, enough so that the team would revive it as their third \"Reverse Retro\" jersey in 2022 and would use an adjusted version of the logo for their AHL team, the\nBridgeport Islanders\n, beginning in 2024.) The year was a disappointment on the ice as well, as the Islanders finished in last place with a record of 22\u201350\u201310. During the season, team management fired Maloney, whom fans blamed for the team's downfall,\n[\n52\n]\nand gave Milbury full control of hockey operations as both a coach and general manager. Milbury went on to resign as head coach during the\nfollowing season\nand elevated assistant\nRick Bowness\nto the position. After another unsuccessful season with little improvement, Milbury took over as coach again during the\n1997\u201398 season\n. The team improved to fourth place in their division but again failed to make the playoffs. Milbury followed by once again stepping down as coach during the\nfollowing season\nwhile retaining his job as general manager.\nDuring the continued playoff drought, instability in the front office mirrored the Islanders' substandard performance on the ice. Pickett sold the team to\nDallas\nbusinessman\nJohn Spano\nin 1996. However, three months after the 1997 closing, Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of the first installment on the cable rights deal. Several Islanders executives tipped off\nNewsday\nthat something was amiss about their new boss.\n[\n53\n]\nIn July,\nNewsday\nexposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required to complete the deal. The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth, and also had two lawsuits pending against him. Within days of the report, Spano was forced to relinquish the team to Pickett. Federal prosecutors turned up evidence that Spano had forged many of the documents used to vouch for his wealth and to promise payment to Pickett, and even appeared to have sent many of the documents from his own office in Dallas. He was sentenced to 71 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. The NHL took additional heat when reports surfaced that the league spent well under $1,000 (depending on the source, the league spent either $525\n[\n53\n]\nor $750\n[\n51\n]\n) to check Spano's background. It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners. The incident and its aftermath were covered in the\nESPN\n30 for 30\ndocumentary,\nBig Shot\n.\n[\n54\n]\nPickett finally found a buyer, a group led by\nHoward Milstein\nand\nPhoenix Coyotes\nco-owner Steven Gluckstern, a deal which almost fell through when\nSpectacor Management Group\n, which managed the Coliseum for Nassau County, tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was safe. Pickett refused, since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in recent seasons. SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders, the NHL, and Nassau County officials.\nInitially, the team made numerous trades and increased their payroll in an effort to assemble a better team. In one transaction, young players\nTodd Bertuzzi\nand\nBryan McCabe\nwere traded for veteran\nTrevor Linden\n. After the Islanders finished 12 points short of the playoffs in the 1997\u201398 season, however, Milstein and Gluckstern decided to run the team on an austere budget in an attempt to make a profit. They also complained about the condition of the Nassau Coliseum and made noises about moving the team elsewhere. They began trading or releasing many popular players to avoid paying their salaries, including star scorer\nZigmund Palffy\n, team captain Linden, former rookie of the year\nBryan Berard\n, and rugged defenseman\nRich Pilon\n. Losing the highly regarded players, the team finished with similar results the next two seasons. Attendance, which had been in a steady decline over the past few years, decreased even further to under 12,000 per game. Around that time, Milstein bid hundreds of millions of dollars in unsuccessful attempts to purchase the\nNational Football League\n's\nWashington Redskins\nand\nCleveland Browns\n.\nNew ownership and a return to the playoffs (2000\u20132006)\n[\nedit\n]\nLet's face it, the Coliseum is a dump, and the team, well, they're losers. It's a real shame. We want to see it change because this is our home. We all deserve better.\n\u2014\nCharles Wang\n[\n55\n]\nIn 2000, Milstein and Gluckstern sold the team to\nComputer Associates\nexecutives\nCharles Wang\nand\nSanjay Kumar\n. The sale cost $187.5\u00a0million ($342.36\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) and gave fans hope for the team to turn its lack of success around.\n[\n55\n]\nThe new owners allowed Milbury to spend money and invest in free agents. His first attempt proved unpopular with fans, as he traded away future star players\nRoberto Luongo\nand\nOlli Jokinen\nto the\nFlorida Panthers\nfor\nOleg Kvasha\nand\nMark Parrish\n. Milbury then further surprised the hockey world when he took\nRick DiPietro\nwith the first selection in the\n2000 draft\n, ahead of consensus picks\nDany Heatley\nand\nMarian Gaborik\n. Reporters and fans were alternately confused and enraged by the moves, which Milbury acknowledged, saying, \"As dangerous as this may be, we think Mad Mike maybe has something going for him.\"\n[\n56\n]\nEstablishing a record of controversial decisions, Milbury held onto the \"Mad Mike\" nickname for years to follow. He remained adamant that his moves were to immediately improve the team, whose poor winning percentage that year was ahead of only the franchise's first season.\n[\n57\n]\nThe team's uninspired play led Milbury to fire head coach and past player\nButch Goring\n. Fans vocalized their dislike of Goring taking the fall rather than Milbury, which was further worsened when Milbury passed on hiring\nTed Nolan\nas Goring's successor; Instead,\nBoston Bruins\nassistant coach\nPeter Laviolette\nwas hired.\n[\n58\n]\nThe Islanders acquired\nAlexei Yashin\n(left) prior to the\n2001\u201302 season\n. Yashin would go on to become the team's captain in later years.\nThree key personnel acquisitions were made prior to the 2001\u201302 season, Laviolette's first.\nAlexei Yashin\nwas acquired from the\nOttawa Senators\nin exchange for forward\nBill Muckalt\n, defenseman\nZdeno Chara\nand the Islanders' second overall pick in the\n2001 draft\n. Next, Islanders prospects\nTim Connolly\nand\nTaylor Pyatt\nwere traded to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin exchange for\nMichael Peca\n, who became the team's captain.\n[\n59\n]\n[\n60\n]\nBy virtue of finishing with the worst record in the previous season,\nDetroit Red Wings\ngoaltender\nChris Osgood\nwas the next addition, taken as the first pick in the September 2001 waiver draft, adding a former Stanley Cup championship goaltender without giving up any players in exchange.\n[\n61\n]\nThe additions proved to be a great help, as the team opened the season with a 9\u20130\u20131\u20131 record, the best in franchise history. They finished the season with new broken records; their 96 points marked the fourth biggest one-year turnaround in the league's history (44 points higher than the previous season), while Osgood's 66 starts surpassed\nRon Hextall\n's previous record of 65.\n[\n22\n]\nDuring the\n2002 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, they were seeded fifth and faced the fourth-seeded\nToronto Maple Leafs\n. The Islanders lost in a very physical first-round series in seven games; the home team won every game of the series. Notably, game 5 featured\nGary Roberts\ncharging Islander defenseman\nKenny Jonsson\n, and\nDarcy Tucker\nsubmarining Peca with a questionable check that tore the Islander captain's\nanterior cruciate ligament\n, sidelining both players for the series' final game. The situation between Tucker and Peca caused a bit of outrage, with speculation that Tucker had intended to injure Peca before the game had begun, which Tucker denied.\n[\n62\n]\nDespite the promise shown in the Toronto playoff series, the Islanders had a slow start to the\n2002\u201303 season\n. They rebounded to make the playoffs, but lost a five-game series in the first round to the top-seeded\nOttawa Senators\n.\n[\n63\n]\nMilbury continued his controversial move-making by firing Laviolette after the season, citing postseason interviews with the players in which they expressed a lack of confidence in the coach.\n[\n64\n]\nHe was replaced with\nSteve Stirling\n, who had previously been coaching the team's top minor league affiliate, the\nBridgeport Sound Tigers\n. In the\nfollowing season\n, the Islanders again lost in the first round of the playoffs, this time to the eventual champion\nTampa Bay Lightning\n.\n[\n65\n]\nFollowing the\n2004\u201305 NHL lockout\n, which eliminated that season of play, the Islanders made several player moves to increase offense for\nfollowing season\n. Peca was traded to the\nEdmonton Oilers\nfor center\nMike York\n, freeing up room under the NHL's new salary cap.\n[\n66\n]\nThe same day, the team signed winger\nMiroslav Satan\nto play alongside Yashin.\n[\n67\n]\nMilbury also worked on remaking the team's defense, adding\nAlexei Zhitnik\n,\nBrad Lukowich\nand\nBrent Sopel\nto replace the departed\nAdrian Aucoin\nand\nRoman Hamrlik\n, who left as free agents, and Jonsson, who left the NHL to play in the\nHockeyAllsvenskan\nin Sweden.\n[\n68\n]\nIn the aftermath, Yashin was named as the team's new captain.\n[\n69\n]\nThe team's inconsistent play led to Stirling's dismissal midway through the season.\n[\n14\n]\nManagement shake-ups and the DiPietro contract (2006\u20132009)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn the day of Stirling's firing, January 11, 2006, Milbury also announced that he would step down as general manager once a successor was found.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n70\n]\nHe served as vice president of Wang's sports properties for one year before resigning in May 2007.\n[\n71\n]\nWang proceeded by hiring\nNeil Smith\nas general manager and\nTed Nolan\nas head coach, following a brief stint by\nBrad Shaw\nas the team's interim head coach.\n[\n72\n]\n[\n73\n]\nSmith, however, was fired after approximately one month and quickly replaced by the team's backup goaltender\nGarth Snow\n, who retired from his playing career to accept the position.\n[\n22\n]\nBefore his dismissal, Smith made several free agent acquisitions, including defensemen\nBrendan Witt\nand\nTom Poti\n, and forwards\nMike Sillinger\nand\nChris Simon\n.\n[\n72\n]\nOn September 12, 2006, the Islanders signed DiPietro to a 15-year, $67.5\u00a0million ($105.28\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) contract, which was believed to be the longest contract to date in the NHL and the second-longest in North American sports, behind a 25-year contract for\nNational Basketball Association\nplayer\nMagic Johnson\n.\n[\n74\n]\n[\n75\n]\nDiPietro, Wang and Snow all spoke confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides, despite the mixed reactions it received from the rest of the hockey world. Specifically, Wang stated, \"This is not a big deal. You have to have a commitment to who you're working with.\"\n[\n74\n]\nAs speculation began as to whether other teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players,\nAtlanta Thrashers\n' general manager\nDon Waddell\nfelt that, \"It's highly unlikely that you will see teams go beyond that. This is a once-in-a-lifetime contract. Ownership must feel very strongly that he's their guy for the next 15 years.\"\n[\n75\n]\nBill Guerin\nwas the team captain from 2007 to 2009.\nThe new-look Islanders were picked by most analysts to languish towards the bottom of the standings.\n[\n76\n]\nEyeing a playoff spot, Snow traded for forward\nRyan Smyth\nfrom the\nEdmonton Oilers\nat the trade deadline on February 27, 2007.\n[\n77\n]\nInjuries to DiPietro provided extra setbacks, but not enough to drop the team from playoff contention.\n[\n78\n]\n[\n79\n]\nThey qualified for the playoffs, assisted by a late-season winning streak and a 3\u20132 shootout victory against the\nNew Jersey Devils\nin their final regular season game.\n[\n80\n]\nDespite DiPietro's return to the team in time for the playoffs, the team lost their first round matchup in five games to the\nPresidents' Trophy\n-winning\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\n[\n81\n]\nManagement announced in June 2007 that they would buy out captain\nAlexei Yashin\n's contract, which had four seasons remaining on it.\n[\n82\n]\nFree agents Smyth, Poti,\nViktor Kozlov\n,\nJason Blake\n, and\nRichard Zednik\nalso left in July 2007.\n[\n83\n]\n[\n84\n]\nDuring that month, the Islanders signed\nBill Guerin\nto a two-year contract as he immediately assumed team captaincy.\n[\n83\n]\nAlso in the off-season, free agents\nMike Comrie\n,\nAndy Sutton\nand\nJon Sim\njoined the team.\n[\n85\n]\n[\n86\n]\nThat summer, it was announced that Nolan extended an invitation to Al Arbour to return as a coach for one game in order to bring his total number of games coached to 1,500.\n[\n87\n]\n[\n88\n]\nArbour signed a one-day contract, the shortest in league history, on November 3, 2007; it put him behind the bench the following day as the Islanders defeated the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n3\u20132, raising his career coaching win total to 740.\n[\n89\n]\nThe team remained in the playoff hunt through the trade deadline as they re-signed Comrie to a one-year contract and traded away Simon and\nMarc-Andre Bergeron\n.\n[\n90\n]\nA rash of injuries saw them plummet to the fifth-worst record in the league by the end of the season.\n[\n91\n]\nJosh Bailey\nwas drafted by the Islanders in 2008, to provide depth at the wing for the team.\nAt the\n2008 NHL entry draft\n, the Islanders made two trades to move down from the fifth to the ninth overall pick, with which they selected center\nJosh Bailey\n. They also added free agents\nMark Streit\nand\nDoug Weight\n. The team dismissed head coach\nTed Nolan\nover alleged philosophy differences,\n[\n92\n]\n[\n93\n]\nand later that summer replaced him with\nScott Gordon\n.\n[\n94\n]\nNear the trade deadline, Snow traded Comrie and\nChris Campoli\nto the\nOttawa Senators\nin exchange for forward\nDean McAmmond\nand the\nSan Jose Sharks\n' first-round draft pick in the\n2009 NHL entry draft\nand sent captain Bill Guerin to the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin exchange for a conditional draft pick.\n[\n95\n]\n[\n96\n]\nIn the\n2008\u201309 season\n, the Islanders finished in last place in the league with a record of 26\u201347\u20139, which was the team's worst record since the 2000\u201301 season. After the conclusion of regular season, they won the draft lottery to retain the first overall pick in the\n2009 NHL entry draft\n.\n[\n97\n]\nThe Tavares era begins (2009\u20132015)\n[\nedit\n]\nBeginning an effort to rebuild the team with new and young talent, the Islanders selected\nJohn Tavares\nwith the first-overall pick of the\n2009 NHL entry draft\n.\n[\n98\n]\nTavares went into the draft as the top prospect in the majority of scouting reports,\n[\n99\n]\nand it was widely expected that the Islanders would select him after they secured the first overall pick by winning the draft lottery, although there was plenty of competition between Tavares,\nVictor Hedman\n, and\nMatt Duchene\n.\n[\n100\n]\nNHL Central Scouting Bureau\n's Chris Edwards spoke highly of him, stating, \"[Tavares] is phenomenal at getting the puck through traffic to his linemates, getting to opening. The way he reads the play and can get to where he figures the rebounds will be and bangs in the rebound. He's a real smart player.\"\n[\n101\n]\nThey traded up twice in the first round to also select defenseman\nCalvin de Haan\nwith the 12th overall pick,\n[\n102\n]\nas well as\nCasey Cizikas\nand\nAnders Lee\nin later rounds, all of whom would go on to play consistently on the main roster by the\n2014\u201315 season\n.\n[\n103\n]\nThe\n2009\u201310 season\nstarted out slow, with the team winless its first six games.\n[\n104\n]\nThe team continued to play inconsistently due to injuries as many wrote them off as potential playoff contenders.\n[\n105\n]\nThe team hit a mid-season hot streak,\n[\n106\n]\nhowever nine losses in 11 games before the Olympic break set them right back.\n[\n107\n]\nThey ultimately ended up at bottom of the standings again, finishing the season 26th in the league.\n[\n108\n]\nThe placement led to a fifth overall pick in\n2010\n. Continuing with their rebuilding process, they used the first round to draft young forwards\nNino Niederreiter\nand\nBrock Nelson\nwith picks five and 30, respectively.\n[\n109\n]\nAs the\n2010\u201311 season\ngot underway, the team quickly fell into a ten-game losing streak, leading to the firing of head coach\nScott Gordon\n.\n[\n110\n]\n[\n111\n]\nHe was replaced on an interim basis by\nJack Capuano\n, who had been coaching the Bridgeport Sound Tigers.\n[\n111\n]\n[\n112\n]\nEarly in the season, they also acquired\nMichael Grabner\nfrom waivers, who went on to score 34 goals and was selected as a finalist for the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n;\n[\n113\n]\n[\n114\n]\nhe would go on to sign a five-year contract with the team at the end of the season.\n[\n114\n]\nThis year also featured the\nPenguins\u2013Islanders brawl\n, which resulted in a combined 346 penalty minutes and a $100,000 fine to the Islanders for \"failure to control their players\".\nJohn Tavares\n, was named an alternate captain for the\n2011\u201312 season\n. He was later named the team captain in 2013.\nThe\nfollowing season\nwas a breakout year for Tavares. The newly named assistant captain gained 31 goals and 50 assists,\n[\n115\n]\nin addition to being selected to play in the\n59th NHL All-Star Game\nat the age of 21;\n[\n116\n]\nhis 81 points were seventh-best in the league.\n[\n117\n]\nTavares' left-winger\nMatt Moulson\nalso had a strong season, finishing with career highs of 36 goals, 33 assists and 69 points.\n[\n118\n]\nDespite strong seasons from their top players, the team finished 27th in the league with a record of 34\u201337\u201311, continuing their pattern of racking up top prospects with early picks at the drafts.\n[\n119\n]\nThey used the first round of the\n2012 draft\nto select defenseman\nGriffin Reinhart\nwith the fourth overall pick.\n[\n120\n]\nOn August 1, 2011, voters in\nNassau County\nrejected a proposal for a new arena to replace Nassau Coliseum. This followed the failed decade-long attempt by owner Charles Wang to build a mixed-use development called\nThe Lighthouse Project\n, which would have renovated the arena.\n[\n121\n]\nIn the wake of the vote, speculation began that the team would eventually move to\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\n, new arenas in\nQueens\nor\nSuffolk County\n, the\nSprint Center\nin\nKansas City\n, or the\nVideotron Centre\nin\nQuebec City\n, the last of which was coincidentally set to open at the same time as the expiration of the Islanders' lease on the Nassau Coliseum in 2015.\n[\n122\n]\n[\n123\n]\n[\n124\n]\nOn October 24, 2012, the Islanders made the announcement that the franchise would indeed be moving to the\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\nfor the 2015\u201316 NHL season, after signing a lease that would keep the team in the arena until 2040. The team retained its name, logo and colors as part of the move.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n125\n]\nAs part of the deal, the management of Barclays Center took over the team's business operations once the Islanders moved to Barclays Center.\n[\n126\n]\nThe decision to move to Brooklyn didn't require the Rangers' approval. Under a longstanding provision of the agreement that allowed the Islanders to share the New York area with the Rangers, the Islanders are allowed to play their games anywhere on Long Island, including the two city boroughs on the island, Brooklyn and\nQueens\n.\n[\n127\n]\nBeginning on April 1, 2013, of the\n2012\u201313 season\n, the team went on a near month-long unbeaten streak in regulation time, posting a 12-game streak of earning points until falling to the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nlater that month.\n[\n128\n]\nDuring that streak, on April 23, 2013, they clinched their first playoff berth since 2007 with a 4\u20133 shootout loss to the\nCarolina Hurricanes\n, ending a six-year playoff drought.\n[\n128\n]\n[\n129\n]\nBehind goaltender\nEvgeni Nabokov\n, the team was ultimately eliminated in six games by the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin the first round of the\nplayoffs\n, continuing their winless streak in playoff series.\n[\n130\n]\n[\n131\n]\nOn September 10, 2013, Tavares was introduced as the 14th captain in New York Islanders history, replacing former Islander Mark Streit of the Philadelphia Flyers, who served as team captain since 2011.\n[\n132\n]\nAfter posting a 4\u20134\u20133 record in their first 11 games, the Islanders made a trade, sending fan favorite and three-time 30-goal scorer Matt Moulson, their 2014 first-round draft pick and their 2015 second-round draft pick to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin exchange for\nThomas Vanek\n, a highly regarded and dynamic goal scorer.\n[\n133\n]\n[\n134\n]\nDespite chemistry with linemates Tavares and\nKyle Okposo\n, however, his desire to test free agency and the team's impending move to\nBarclays Center\n[\n135\n]\nled to Vanek being dealt to the\nMontreal Canadiens\nat the trade deadline for\nSebastian Collberg\nand a second-round pick in\n2014\n.\n[\n136\n]\n[\n137\n]\nAfter a season of player swapping and goaltending issues, they failed to qualify for the\nplayoffs\n, finishing with a record of 34\u201337\u201311.\n[\n138\n]\nThe Islanders acquired\nNick Leddy\nthrough a trade with the\nChicago Blackhawks\nduring the 2014 off-season.\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Islanders made several moves to improve the team before their\nfinal season\nat Nassau Coliseum. In May, the Islanders acquired the rights to\nJaroslav Halak\nfrom the\nWashington Capitals\nin exchange for a fourth-round pick in 2014. Halak was then signed to a four-year contract. The Islanders also signed\nMikhail Grabovski\n,\nNikolai Kulemin\nand goaltender\nChad Johnson\nas free agents. Additionally, on October 4, the Islanders acquired\nJohnny Boychuk\nfrom the\nBoston Bruins\nfor two-second round picks in 2014 and\n2015\nand a conditional third-round pick in 2015, as well as\nNick Leddy\nfrom the\nChicago Blackhawks\nin exchange for prospect\nVille Pokka\n,\nT. J. Brennan\nand the rights to\nAnders Nilsson\n.\nThe NHL Board of Governors approved the Islanders' sale to businessmen\nJon Ledecky\nand\nScott D. Malkin\nin October 2014. Ledecky and Malkin served as minority partners during a two-year transition period. At the end of the 2015\u201316 season, they formally took majority control from Wang, who retained a share of the franchise.\n[\n139\n]\nThe Islanders finished the 2014\u201315 regular season with a record of 47\u201328\u20137 for 101 points, and met the Washington Capitals in the first round of the\n2015 playoffs\n. The Capitals held home-ice advantage in the series after the Islanders lost their final regular season game to the\nColumbus Blue Jackets\n, 5\u20134, in a shootout, as the Islanders lost the season series to the Capitals after posting a 2\u20131\u20131 record in the season series (Washington went 2\u20130\u20132, winning the season series with six points to the Islanders' five). On April 19, 2015, in the third game of their first-round series against Washington, John Tavares scored 15 seconds into overtime to win the game for the Islanders, 2\u20131. It was the second-shortest overtime playoff game in Islanders history, and was the first overtime, game-winning goal for the Islanders in the playoffs since 1993. The Islanders lost the fourth and fifth games of their series before rebounding in the sixth game to force a seventh game in the series. However, they were denied entry into the second round by a single goal and would ultimately fall to the Capitals in seven games. As a result, game 6 was the Islanders' last game at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum; the Isles'\nCal Clutterbuck\nscored the final NHL goal in the building's first run prior to the Islanders' return in 2018.\nMove to Barclays Center and playoff series win (2015\u20132017)\n[\nedit\n]\nIn June 2015, the Islanders entered the\n2015 draft\nwithout a first-round pick, but emerged with two first-rounders in\nMathew Barzal\nand\nAnthony Beauvillier\nafter a series of draft day trades.\n[\n140\n]\nThe Islanders also selected forward\nAndong Song\nin the sixth round of the 2015 draft, making him the first Chinese player to be drafted by an NHL team.\n[\n141\n]\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\n. The Islanders played their home games there from 2015 to 2020.\nThe Islanders played their first regular season game at\nBarclays Center\non October 9, 2015, losing 3\u20132 in overtime to the\nChicago Blackhawks\n.\nArtem Anisimov\nscored the first regular season goal, while Tavares scored the first regular season Islanders goal. The Islanders posted the fourth-best penalty kill rate and allowed the fewest power-play goals during the season. However, in the last quarter of the regular season, some players, including Halak and defenseman\nTravis Hamonic\n, suffered key injuries. The team finished the regular season fourth in the Metropolitan Division with 100 points, enough to clinch the first wild card spot in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced off against the\nFlorida Panthers\n; goaltender\nThomas Greiss\nonly played in 40 minutes of playoff hockey with the\nSan Jose Sharks\nprior to this series. Both teams split the first four games of the series. The fifth game of the series proved to be a major turning point, as late season call-up\nAlan Quine\nscored the game-winning goal on the power play with four minutes left in double overtime to end the second-longest game in franchise history; that goal gave them a 3\u20132 series lead and a chance to clinch the series on home ice. In the sixth game, the Islanders trailed 1\u20130 for much of the game, but Tavares tied it late in the third period. Tavares would score again with the series-clinching goal in double overtime to give the Islanders their first playoff series win since 1993. In the second round of the playoffs, they faced the Tampa Bay Lightning for the first time since 2004. Despite winning the first game of the series, the Islanders lost their series to the Lightning in five games.\nAndrew Ladd\nprior to a game during the\n2016\u201317 season\n. Ladd signed with the Islanders as a free agent during the 2016 off-season.\nSummer of 2016 saw free agents and longtime Islanders Kyle Okposo, Frans Nielsen, and Matt Martin all depart the team, joining the\nBuffalo Sabres\n,\nDetroit Red Wings\n, and\nToronto Maple Leafs\n, respectively. Snow signed free agents\nAndrew Ladd\nfrom the\nChicago Blackhawks\nand\nJason Chimera\nfrom the\nWashington Capitals\nto help fill the gaps left behind.\n[\n142\n]\nAfter an underwhelming first half of the\n2016\u201317 season\n, posting a 17\u201317\u20138 record through 42 games, head coach Jack Capuano was relieved of duties, with assistant general manager\nDoug Weight\nbeing named interim head coach.\n[\n143\n]\nHaving coached the team since 2010, Capuano was the second-winningest coach in the team's history with 227 wins, also leading the team to their first playoff series win since 1993.\n[\n144\n]\nPrior to Capuano's release, goaltender Jaroslav Halak was placed on waivers, and eventually sent down to the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. Having carried three goaltenders for the second consecutive season, the decision was made to stick with the tandem of Greiss and back-up\nJean-Francois Berube\nafter Halak posted a 6\u20138\u20135 record with a .904 save percentage through the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season.\n[\n145\n]\nIn late January 2017, following a report by\nBloomberg News\nwhich speculated that Barclays Center was considering removing the Islanders due to poor attendance and effects on the venue's profit margins (reception to Barclays Center as a hockey venue was mixed partly due to obstructed view seats,\n[\n146\n]\nas well as features like an off-center scoreboard, and the Islanders had the third-worst average attendance in the entire league while playing at the venue),\nNewsday\nreported that Nassau County executive Edward Mangano had met with one of the team's co-owners, and told the paper that it was possible that the Islanders could return to the renovated Nassau Coliseum.\n[\n147\n]\n[\n148\n]\nHowever, commissioner\nGary Bettman\nconsidered the concept to be \"unviable\" (the renovation reduced the capacity of the arena to just under 14,000, which is smaller than any NHL arena), and noted that Ledecky and Malkin were pursuing a possible arena project at\nBelmont Park\n.\n[\n149\n]\nDespite winning their last six games of the 2016\u201317 season, the Islanders finished in ninth place in the Eastern Conference; they missed the playoffs by only one point when the Toronto Maple Leafs clinched the final playoff spot on the penultimate day of the season.\nEmergence of Barzal and management overhaul (2017\u2013present)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn February 9, 2018, rookie\nMathew Barzal\nrecorded his third five-point game, becoming only the second rookie to do so since\nJoe Malone\nin 1917\u201318 and tying a 100-year-old record in the process.\n[\n150\n]\nAt the end of the 2017\u201318 regular season, Barzal had 85 points (22 goals, 63 assists).

When the NHL season was suspended on March 12, 2020, the Islanders had twelve regular season games remaining and were one point shy of the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\n[\n168\n]\nThe Islanders qualified for the NHL Return-to-Play initiative as the seventh seed, beating the\nFlorida Panthers\nin four games in a best-of-5 qualifying round to make the\n2020 Stanley Cup playoffs\n. They would then go on to defeat the\nWashington Capitals\nin the first round in five games. Then, after blowing a 3\u20131 series lead to the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nthat extended the series to seven games, the Islanders would go on to win game 7 against the Flyers and advance to the conference finals for the first time since the\n1993 playoffs\n. However, their run would come to an end at the hands of the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nin six games. In December 2020, New York Islanders Hockey Club, L.P. bought the remaining 15 percent stake of the team from the\nestate of Charles Wang\nand took full ownership of the team.\n[\n169\n]\n[\n170\n]\n[\n171\n]\nThe Islanders again made the playoffs in the shortened 2020\u201321 season, defeating the Penguins and Bruins each in six games. They again lost to the Tampa Bay Lightning, this time in seven.\nThe Islanders started the 2021\u201322 season on a 13-game road trip while\nUBS Arena\nwas finalizing construction, finishing their road trip with a 5\u20136\u20132 record.\n[\n172\n]\nHowever, minutes before the first home game of the season on November 20, 2021, many Islander players contracted COVID-19 and missed the home opener and several others. Longest tenured Islander\nJosh Bailey\nand team captain\nAnders Lee\nmissed the game, while\nAdam Pelech\n,\nAnthony Beauvillier\n, and\nAndy Greene\nwere ruled out minutes before puck drop.\n[\n173\n]\nThey lost the home opener to the\nCalgary Flames\nby a score of 5\u20132.\n[\n174\n]\nBrad Richardson\nscored the first goal in UBS Arena history, while\nBrock Nelson\nscored the first Islander goal.\n[\n174\n]\nThe Islanders won their first game at UBS Arena against the Devils, on December 11, by a score of 4\u20132. Former Devils captain\nZach Parise\nscored the game-winning goal for the Islanders.\n[\n175\n]\nThe Islanders missed the playoffs after three consecutive trips, finishing the season with a 37\u201335\u201310 record.\n[\n176\n]\nOn May 9, 2022, head coach Barry Trotz was relieved from his duties,\n[\n177\n]\nand replaced with\nLane Lambert\n.\n[\n178\n]\nIn the\nnext season\n, the Islanders finished as the first wild card, but were defeated by the Carolina Hurricanes in the first round of the\n2023 playoffs\n.\nAfter an inconsistent start to the\n2023\u201324 season\n, head coach Lane Lambert was fired on January 20, 2024, and\nPatrick Roy\nwas hired as his replacement.\n[\n179\n]\n[\n180\n]\nThe Islanders finished in third place in the Metropolitan Division and lost to the Carolina Hurricanes in the first round of the\n2024 playoffs\n.\nAfter a disappointing\n2024\u201325 season\nwhere the team finished 35\u201335\u201312 and missing the playoffs by nine points, the Islanders announced on April 22, 2025, that they would not be renewing Lamoriello's contract, effectively ending his time as general manager and president of hockey operations.\n[\n181\n]\nDespite having only the 10th-best odds, the Islanders won the\n2025 NHL draft lottery\nacquiring the right select first overall for the first time since 2009.\n[\n182\n]\nIn the off-season,\nMathieu Darche\nreplace Lamoriello as general manager.\n[\n183\n]\nTeam identity\n[\nedit\n]\nLogo\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders' first logo, used from 1972 to 1995; a similar logo with a slight difference in colors was used from 1997 to 2010.\nThe club's current wordmark logo.\nAdvertising executive John Alogna created the original Islanders logo, a circle with the letters \"NY\" over a map of the\nNassau\nand\nSuffolk\ncounties. The lower part of the Y is made to resemble a hockey stick, with three orange stripes near the bottom of the shaft and a puck to the right of the stick blade. At the bottom of the logo, the name of the team is written so that the tip of the \"I\" ends in a point aimed at\nUniondale\n, the location of Nassau Coliseum.\nBefore the\n1995\u201396 season\n, the Islanders attempted to update their look by introducing a new logo depicting a fisherman holding a hockey stick. The new logo was a marketing disaster; the reaction among the fanbase was so negative that management announced it would revert to the original logo as soon as league rules allowed them to do so. Many found that the logo bore a strong resemblance to the\nGorton's fisherman\n; indeed,\nNew York Rangers\nfans taunted the Islanders with chants of \"We want\nfishsticks\n!\" long after the logo was discarded.\n[\n184\n]\nThe traditional logo was phased back in over the next two seasons, starting as an\nalternate jersey\nlogo in\n1996\u201397\nbefore fully replacing the fisherman in\n1997\u201398\n. The only change to the classic logo at this time was its colors; as the team had replaced its original royal blue with navy, the logo was recolored to match.\nThe short-lived \"Fisherman\" logo, used from 1995 to 1997\nBeginning in\n2008\u201309\n, the Islanders introduced another modification to their original logo for their new third jersey. The \"new\" logo, once again in royal blue, now features four orange stripes on the hockey stick instead of three, representing the four consecutive Stanley Cup titles won by the team in the 1980s. This became the team's full-time logo in 2010.\nFor their\n2014 Stadium Series\nspecial jerseys, the Islanders used a simplified jersey logo with just the \"NY\" from their regular logo. Versions of that have since appeared on third jersey designs.\nJerseys\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders debuted in 1972 with traditional-style jerseys: one was white with orange and royal blue stripes near the waistline and on the sleeves, the other was royal blue with white and orange stripes. The design remained largely the same, with only minor tweaks through the\n1994\u201395 season\n.\nPrior to the\n1995\u201396 season\n, team executives decided to change the jersey. The fisherman logo replaced the \"NY\" circular design, incorporating navy blue and a brighter orange, and introducing teal and gray shades. The team was seeking increased merchandise revenues, with the outward justification of connecting the team more overtly to Long Island. The jersey included a lighthouse shoulder patch, a reference to the\nMontauk Lighthouse\n, and featured uneven stripes resembling an ocean wave near the waistline, on the sleeves, and across the shoulders. All of the numbering and lettering on the jerseys also followed the wave pattern.\n[\n185\n]\nLate in the season, the team eliminated the fisherman logo, but league rules forbade them from switching jersey designs for the\n1996\u201397 season\non only a few months' notice. Instead, they debuted their first\nthird (and fourth) jerseys\n, which were identical to the home and road jerseys worn by the team, except the circular \"NY\" crest, now colored in the navy blue and bright orange shades to match, replaced the fisherman logo. The team wore these jerseys in approximately 15 games during that season and adopted them permanently in the\n1997\u201398 season\n.\nThe shoulder logo used on Islanders jerseys from 1998 through 2010\nPrior to the\n1998\u201399 season\n, the team's jerseys reverted to a traditional design but kept the navy blue and bright orange shades from the jerseys used the previous three seasons. They added a shoulder patch of four bars, alternating in color, to represent the Islanders' four Stanley Cup championships. A predominantly orange third jersey was introduced in\n2002\u201303\n, featuring navy blue yokes and sides that formed sharp points on the sleeves and body. The team wore this jersey through the\n2006\u201307 season\n.\nFor the\n2007\u201308 season\n, the Islanders redesigned their uniforms as all NHL teams changed over to the\nReebok Edge\nsystem. These jerseys resembled the prior design but included uniform numbers on the right chest above the logo. The name plates were also in two colored format: white on orange on the navy blue home jersey and navy blue on orange on the white road jersey. The sleeves on both jerseys were orange, with a wide navy stripe above a thin white stripe at the elbow. The jerseys had a thin stripe tracing around the shoulders, and featured \"retro\" laces at the neck.\nA royal blue throwback design was introduced the following season as a third jersey. Before the\n2010\u201311 season\n, the Islanders made this throwback design their new home jersey. A corresponding new white road jersey was unveiled during the Islanders'\ndraft\nparty at Nassau Coliseum.\n[\n186\n]\nFor the following season, they unveiled an alternate jersey in black with grey on the shoulder yoke. The front of the jersey bore the team name above the player's number in orange with blue and white trim. The Islanders crest was placed on the shoulder yoke. Diagonal side panels, blue trimmed in orange and gray, combined with similar panels on the black pants to form a diamond shape on the sides of each player. These were only used sparing for two seasons, as they proved unpopular.\nDuring the\n2014 Stadium Series\n, the Islanders wore a special edition jersey. The front side featured the \"NY\" from the primary logo in a special chrome treatment, while the back side featured a white nameplate with blue letters for player names, and bigger numbers in white trimmed in orange for visibility purposes. The sleeve numbers were also angled diagonally. The primary Islanders logo would be placed on the left shoulder within the white yoke. This jersey was promoted to an alternate third jersey in the\n2014\u201315 season\n, replacing the black third jersey. During that season, on February 3, 2015, the team wore an updated version of the fisherman jersey for warmups before their game against the\nFlorida Panthers\n.\n[\n187\n]\n[\n188\n]\nThe Islanders retired the Stadium Series third jersey after only one season, replacing it with a new black alternate that was unveiled to coincide with the team's move to Brooklyn. Unlike the previous black alternate, this version featured little blue and orange at all (these colors appear only on the rear collar), while the \"NY\" insignia that was carried over from the Stadium Series jersey was stripped of its chrome accents. The four narrow white stripes on the sleeves symbolize the franchise's four Stanley Cup wins.\nWhen the NHL switched to\nAdidas\nas its uniform provider in 2017, the Islanders kept their primary jerseys mostly intact except for the restoration of the blue trim in the primary logo on the road jersey. As with all NHL teams, the Islanders only wore two jerseys for the 2017\u201318 season, thus retiring the all-black third jerseys.\nThe Islanders released a new blue third jersey for the 2018\u201319 season, featuring an updated \"NY\" insignia (shorter \"Y-stick\" with four orange stripes on the blade), white shoulder yoke (reminiscent of the 2014 Stadium Series alternates), the map of Long Island on the collar, and orange numbers that call back to the jerseys used during the team's inaugural season.\n[\n189\n]\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the Islanders released a special \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform. The uniform resembled their current home jerseys, but used the navy blue and bright orange scheme worn from 1995 to 2010.\n[\n190\n]\nA second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was released in the 2022\u201323 season, using the \"Fisherman\" uniform from 1995 to 1997 but with less teal elements and diagonal orange striping.\n[\n191\n]\nDuring the\n2024 Stadium Series\n, the Islanders wore navy blue jerseys with a thick orange middle stripe. \"ISLES\" in navy blue letters was added within the orange stripe, as are the navy blue numbers.\n[\n192\n]\nThe Islanders reverted to wearing only their primary jerseys after\nFanatics\ntook over as the NHL uniform provider in 2024, even though it kept most aspects of Adidas' template and retained the use of third jerseys.\nMascot and Ice Girls\n[\nedit\n]\nIce Girls at a community event in 2013\nThe Islanders' team mascot is named \"\nSparky the Dragon\n\", who served at one point as cross-promotion with the\nArena Football League\n's\nNew York Dragons\nteam, who also played their home games at Nassau Coliseum. In the mid-1990s, the Islanders had a mascot named \"Nyisles\" whose body style went from round to human-shaped, and facial features vaguely resembled the logo fisherman, excluding its red hair and beard. Nyisles was discontinued toward the end of the\n1997\u201398 season\nwhen the team distributed \"Who kidnapped Nyisles?\" flyers implying the reason for his disappearance was because of another NHL mascot, ultimately revealed to be\nToronto Maple Leafs\nmascot\nCarlton the Bear\n. Nyisles returned as the secondary mascot of the club with a brand new look in December 2022 to coincide with the return of the Fisherman logo on the team's reverse retro uniforms.\n[\n193\n]\nFrom the 2001\u201302 season to the 2014\u201315 season, the Islanders also had an ice crew named the \"Ice Girls\", made up of only women who skated onto the ice during television breaks to clean up the snow that piled up during the game. The Ice Girls were also used for promotional purposes during games and at community events. Starting in the 2015\u201316 season, a co-ed ice crew would replace the Ice Girls.\nSeason-by-season record\n[\nedit\n]\nThis is only a partial list of the last five seasons.

However, the team does not maintain a traditional radio network due to the other New York/New Jersey area teams filling the available tri-state radio stations covering sports. This causes complications with advertising and commercial breaks that do not make a traditional radio network feasible.\nWCBS\nbegan airing Islanders games starting with the 2016 playoffs, returning the team to a major market New York signal.\n[\n212\n]\nThe games moved to\nWNYM\nand\nWMCA\nin 2017 before being consolidated on WEPN in 2019.\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nList of New York Islanders draft picks\nList of Stanley Cup champions\nNotes\n[\nedit\n]\n^\n*Regular season conference champion (\n1977\u201378\n,\n1978\u201379\n,\n1980\u201381\n)\n*Conference champion in playoffs (\n1981\u201382\n,\n1982\u201383\n,\n1983\u201384\n)\n^\nThe\nPresidents' Trophy\nwas not introduced until\n1985\u201386\n.

The Islanders compete in the\nNational Hockey League\n(NHL) as a member of the\nMetropolitan Division\nin the\nEastern Conference\n. The team plays its home games at\nUBS Arena\n. The Islanders are one of three NHL franchises in the\nNew York metropolitan area\n, along with the\nNew Jersey Devils\nand\nNew York Rangers\n, and their fanbase resides primarily on\nLong Island\n.\nThe team was founded in\n1972\nas part of the NHL's maneuvers to keep a team from rival league\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) out of the newly built\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nin suburban\nUniondale, New York\n. After two years of building up the team's roster, they found almost instant success by securing 14 straight playoff berths starting with their third season. The Islanders won four consecutive\nStanley Cup\nchampionships between\n1980\nand\n1983\n, the eighth of nine\ndynasties\nrecognized by the NHL in its history. Their 19 consecutive playoff series wins between 1980 and 1984 is a feat that remains unparalleled in the history of professional sports. They are the last team in any major professional North American sport to win four consecutive championships, and to date the last NHL team to achieve a\nthree-peat\n.\nFollowing the team's dynasty era, the franchise ran into problems with money, ownership and management, an aging arena, and low attendance. Their woes were reflected on the ice, as the team has not won a division title since\n1987\u201388\n, and went 22 seasons without winning a playoff series prior to the\n2016 playoffs\n. After years of failed attempts to rebuild or replace Nassau Coliseum in suburban Long Island, the Islanders relocated to\nBarclays Center\nin Brooklyn following the\n2014\u201315 season\n.\n[\n4\n]\nIn the\n2018\u201319\nand\n2019\u201320\nseasons, the Islanders split their home games between Barclays Center and Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders played all their home games in the\n2020\u201321 season\nat Nassau Coliseum. Their\nnew arena\nnear\nBelmont Park\nwas opened in 2021.\nTen former members of the Islanders have been inducted into the\nHockey Hall of Fame\n, seven of whom\u2014\nMike Bossy\n,\nClark Gillies\n,\nDenis Potvin\n,\nBilly Smith\n,\nBryan Trottier\n, coach\nAl Arbour\n, and general manager\nBill Torrey\n\u2014were members of all four Cup-winning teams. Post-dynasty players\nPat LaFontaine\n,\nRoberto Luongo\nand\nPierre Turgeon\nwere also inducted.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe NHL heads to Long Island (1972\u20131974)\n[\nedit\n]\nIn fall 1972, the emerging\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) planned to place its New York team, the\nNew York Raiders\n, in\nNassau County\n's brand-new\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\n.\n[\n5\n]\nCounty officials did not consider the WHA a major league and wanted to keep the Raiders out.\n[\n6\n]\nWilliam Shea\n, who had helped bring\nMajor League Baseball\n's\nNew York Mets\nto the area a decade earlier, was enlisted to bring an NHL team to Long Island. Although Shea had previously worked with upstart rival leagues including the aborted\nContinental League\n, the\nAmerican Football League\nand the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n, his ultimate goal in these efforts had always been to try to persuade the established leagues to grant second franchises to New York as had been the case with the Mets (and also with the\nNew York Jets\nand\nNew York Nets\n, as a result of those teams' leagues merging with their established rivals).\nWilliam Shea\nplayed a major role in bringing a hockey team to Long Island.\nIn contrast, Shea decided there was no need to work with the WHA since unlike the initial results of his previous approaches to established leagues in the other major sports, Shea immediately found NHL president\nClarence Campbell\nto be receptive to adding a second team in New York. Nevertheless, the Islanders' bid faced opposition from the\nNew York Rangers\n, who did not want additional competition in the New York area.\n[\n7\n]\nEventually, Campbell and Shea persuaded the Rangers' owners,\nMadison Square Garden\n, to reconsider. Rangers' president\nBill Jennings\nweighed pros and cons. Another local NHL team would be compelled to compensate the Rangers for sharing the New York area. On the other hand, a WHA team would owe the Rangers nothing unless it was included in a potential NHL\u2013WHA merger, a prospect to which both Campbell and Jennings were adamantly opposed. Finally, consenting to the establishment of an NHL franchise in suburban Nassau County would help to ensure the vast majority of the Rangers' fanbase within New York City proper would continue to support the older franchise, and reduced the prospect of a rival league eventually establishing a team and fanbase there. Perhaps remembering the crucial role the Jets had played in ensuring the success of the AFL just a few years earlier as a challenger of the\nNational Football League\n, Jennings decided to help bring a new NHL team to the New York metropolitan area.\n[\n8\n]\nDespite expanding to 14 teams just two years prior, the NHL awarded a\nLong Island\n-based franchise to clothing manufacturer\nRoy Boe\n, owner of the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n's\nNew York Nets\n, on November 8, 1971.\n[\n8\n]\nThe terms included $6\u00a0million ($45.1\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) franchise fee plus a $5\u00a0million ($37.59\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) territorial fee to the Rangers.\n[\n10\n]\nAn expansion franchise was also given to\nAtlanta\n(the\nFlames\n) to keep the schedule balanced and to prevent the WHA from entering the growing market at the newly built\nOmni Coliseum\n.\n[\n7\n]\nThe New York Islanders name was unveiled by the franchise on February 15, 1972, at a\npress conference\nheld across the street from\nRoosevelt Raceway\nat a restaurant owned by\nBurt Bacharach\n.\n[\n11\n]\nMany expected it to use the \"\nLong Island Ducks\n\", after the\nEastern Hockey League\nteam that played from 1959 to 1973.\n[\n12\n]\nThe team was soon nicknamed the \"Isles\" by the local newspapers. The Islanders' arrival effectively doomed the Raiders, who played in Madison Square Garden under difficult lease terms and were forced to move to\nCherry Hill, New Jersey\nin the middle of their second season.\n[\n6\n]\nFormer\nCalifornia Golden Seals\nexecutive vice president\nBill Torrey\nwas named as the team's general manager at the same press conference as the franchise's name unveiling.\n[\n11\n]\nThe Islanders secured veteran forward\nEd Westfall\n, defenseman\nGerry Hart\n, and goaltender\nBilly Smith\nin the\n1972 expansion draft\n, along with\njunior ice hockey\nstars\nBilly Harris\n,\nLorne Henning\n, and\nBobby Nystrom\nin the\n1972 amateur draft\n.\n[\n13\n]\nSoon after the draft,\nPhil Goyette\nwas named as the team's first head coach, however he was fired halfway through the season and replaced with\nEarl Ingarfield\nand assistant coach\nAut Erickson\n.\n[\n14\n]\nUnlike most other expansion teams' general managers, Torrey made few trades for veteran players in the early years, as he was committed to building the team through the draft. Torrey stated, \"I told the owners that we're not going to beat this team next door by taking the castoffs from others teams. We'd have to develop our own stars.\"\n[\n13\n]\nBefore the season began, Westfall was named the team's first captain.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\nBy September 1972, the Islanders were waiting for the Nassau Coliseum to be completed as well as their practice facility \"The Royal Ice Rink\" in\nKings Park\n. The team was forced to practice as late as October 6, the day before their first game, at the Rangers practice rink in\nNew Hyde Park\n.\n[\n17\n]\nThe Islanders' first win came on October 12, 1972, in a 3\u20132 game against the\nLos Angeles Kings\n.\n[\n14\n]\nIn the team's first season, young players such as Smith, Nystrom, and Henning (all of whom would be part of the Islanders dynasty of the early 1980s) were given chances to prove themselves in the NHL. The young and inexperienced expansion team, however, posted a record of 12\u201360\u20136, setting an NHL record for most losses and worst overall record in a season.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n18\n]\nA highlight occurred on January 18, 1973, when they defeated the defending\nStanley Cup\nchampion\nBoston Bruins\n9\u20137.\n[\n14\n]\nFinishing last in the standings that season, they received the right to select first in the\n1973 draft\n.\n[\n18\n]\nOff the ice, the Islanders struggled financially, a situation that was exacerbated by the then-unprecedented $11 million in franchise and territorial fees.\nMontreal Canadiens\n' general manager\nSam Pollock\nwas keen to acquire the Islanders' pick so he could draft French Canadian junior star defenseman\nDenis Potvin\n, who had been touted as \"the next\nBobby Orr\n\" when he was 14 years old. Pollock made several lucrative trade offers including cash to the Islanders, but Torrey turned the Canadiens down and selected Potvin with the first overall pick.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n19\n]\nDuring the off-season, Torrey convinced former\nSt. Louis Blues\ncoach\nAl Arbour\nto come coach the Islanders.\n[\n8\n]\nEven with Arbour as the team's head coach and Potvin, who won the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\nas NHL Rookie of the Year, the team again finished last in the\nEast Division\nduring the\n1973\u201374 season\n, but allowed 100 fewer goals than the previous season. The season included their first win against the Rangers, on October 27, 1973,\n[\n5\n]\nwhich also happened to be the game where Potvin scored his first NHL goal. Although they failed to make the playoffs, their 56 points represented a 26-point improvement from the previous season.\n[\n8\n]\nAscendancy and playoff inability (1974\u20131979)\n[\nedit\n]\nDenis Potvin\nled the Islanders to playoff success in the 1970s and 1980s.\nWith the 4th and 22nd picks in the\n1974 draft\n, the Islanders added young forwards\nClark Gillies\nand\nBryan Trottier\nto continue Torrey's building plan.\n[\n20\n]\nIn the\n1974\u201375 season\n, the Islanders made one of the biggest turnarounds in NHL history. Led by Potvin, forwards Westfall, Harris, Nystrom, Gillies, and goaltenders Smith and\nGlenn \"Chico\" Resch\n, the team earned 88 points, 32 more than the previous season and two more than their first two seasons combined, earning their first playoff berth. They defeated the rival\nNew York Rangers\nin a best-of-3 first-round series as\nJ. P. Parise\nscored just 11 seconds into overtime of the third game.\n[\n8\n]\nIn the next round, down three games to none in a best-of-seven series against the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, the Islanders rallied to win the next four and take the series-winning game 7 on a late third-period goal by Westfall. Only four other major North American professional sports teams have accomplished this feat (the\n1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs\n,\n2004 Boston Red Sox\n, the\n2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers\n, and the\n2013\u201314 Los Angeles Kings\n).\n[\n21\n]\nThey were close but not as lucky in the following round, rallying from another 3\u20130 deficit to force a seventh game against the defending\nStanley Cup\nchampion\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nbefore the Flyers took the decisive seventh game at home and went on to win the Cup again.\n[\n8\n]\nDespite a disappointing playoff finish, Arbour remained complimentary of the team's attitude and maturity, saying \"If I called a practice next week, every one of them would show up.\"\n[\n22\n]\nThe Islanders continued their climb up the standings in\n1975\u201376\n, earning 101 points and the fifth-best record in the league.\n[\n23\n]\nIt was the first 100-point season in Islanders history, in only their fourth year of existence.\n[\n24\n]\nRookie center Trottier finished the season with 95 points and won the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n; his points and assists (63) totals set a new league record for most in each category by a rookie.\n[\n25\n]\nIt would be the first of four consecutive 100-point seasons, including the first two division titles in franchise history.\n[\n24\n]\n[\n26\n]\nDespite the emergence of young star players and regular season success between 1976 and 1979 the Islanders suffered a series of playoff disappointments. In\n1976\nand\n1977 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, the Islanders were knocked out in the semifinals by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the\nMontreal Canadiens\n.\n[\n27\n]\nThe Canadiens posted a 24\u20133 record in the playoffs during those two seasons with all three losses coming at the hands of the Islanders.\n[\n28\n]\nMike Bossy\nwas selected with the 15th overall pick in\n1977\nand became the third Islander to win the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n.\nIn the\n1977 draft\n, Torrey had the 15th overall pick and was deciding between forwards\nMike Bossy\nand\nDwight Foster\n. Bossy was known as an emerging scorer who lacked physicality. Foster was known as a solid\nchecker\nwith marginal offensive ability (despite having led the\nOntario Hockey League\nin scoring). Arbour persuaded Torrey to pick Bossy, arguing it was easier to teach a scorer how to check.\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nIn the\n1977\u201378 season\n, Bossy became the third Islander to win the Calder Trophy, and scored 53 goals that season, a rookie record at the time.\n[\n8\n]\nThe team earned their first Patrick Division and Campbell Conference championships.\n[\n14\n]\nSix players finished the season with 30 goals scored or more, with five of them Islanders draft picks, showing the success of the draft building process.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n31\n]\nThe season ended with a familiar result in the\nplayoffs\n, as the team lost in overtime in game 7 of the quarterfinals against the\nToronto Maple Leafs\n.\n[\n29\n]\nIn\n1978\u201379\n, the team finished with the best record in the NHL, clinching it with three goals in the third period of the season's final game against the Rangers. Trottier won the\nHart Memorial Trophy\nas league MVP and captured the\nArt Ross Trophy\nfor the most points, while sophomore Bossy scored 69 goals, which also led the league. Despite their regular season dominance, the Islanders exited the playoffs with another upset playoff loss, this time to the Rangers in the semifinals. As the team was leaving\nMadison Square Garden\nfollowing their game 6 elimination, Rangers fans rocked and threw objects at the team's bus. Hockey professionals and journalists generally questioned whether the Islanders were capable of winning the important games needed to win a Stanley Cup championship. Islander players would cite fear of repeating the pain of this loss as spurring their later success. After transferring the captaincy to Gillies the season before, Westfall retired and shortly thereafter became a color commentator on the team's telecasts.\nOff the ice, the Islanders were on shaky ground. Boe was losing money on both his franchises, even as the Islanders quickly surged to NHL prominence and the Nets became an ABA power. The Islanders were still far behind on the $10\u00a0million they had paid in startup costs, and the expansion and territorial fees associated with moving the Nets to the\nNational Basketball Association\nthrew Boe's finances into a tailspin. Eventually, Boe was forced to sell both his teams. He readily found a buyer for the Nets, but had less luck finding one for the Islanders. Torrey orchestrated a sale to one of the team's limited partners,\nJohn Pickett\n. In return, Pickett promoted Torrey to team president, though Torrey had already been operating head of the franchise before then. Soon after purchasing the team, Pickett signed a very lucrative\ncable television\ncontract with the fledgling\nSportsChannel\nnetwork as their owner,\nCharles Dolan\n, thought the up-and-coming Islanders would be a perfect centerpiece for his new network. Dolan gave Pickett a long-term guaranteed contract intended not only to keep the team on Long Island, but give area governments an incentive to renew his cable contracts. The Islanders have remained on the network, now known as\nMSG Sportsnet\n, for over four decades.\nThe Dynasty (1979\u20131983)\n[\nedit\n]\nAfter the Islanders' regular season dominance and playoff disappointment in 1979, Arbour decided that he would no longer concern himself too greatly with his team's finish in the regular season. Instead, he focused his team's energy on how they would perform in the playoffs. In\n1980\n, the Islanders dropped below the 100-point mark for the first time in five years, earning only 91 points. However, they finally broke through and won the\nStanley Cup\n.\nBefore the\n1980\nplayoffs, the Islanders acquired\nButch Goring\nfrom the\nLos Angeles Kings\n. Goring's arrival was often called the \"final piece of the puzzle.\"\nBefore the playoffs, Torrey made the difficult decision to trade longtime and popular veterans Billy Harris and defenseman\nDave Lewis\nto the\nLos Angeles Kings\nfor second line center\nButch Goring\n. Goring's arrival is often called the \"final piece of the puzzle\",\n[\n32\n]\na strong two-way player, his presence on the second line ensured that opponents would no longer be able to focus their defensive efforts on the Islanders' first line of Bossy, Trottier and\nClark Gillies\n. Contributions from new teammates, such as wingers\nDuane Sutter\nand\nAnders Kallur\nand\nstay-at-home defensemen\nDave Langevin\n,\nGord Lane\n, and\nKen Morrow\n(the latter fresh off a gold medal win at the\n1980 Olympics\n), also figured prominently in the Islanders' playoff success.\nIn the playoffs, the Islanders defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3\u20131 in the preliminary round, then beat the Boston Bruins 4\u20131 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, the Islanders faced the\nBuffalo Sabres\n, who had finished second overall in the NHL standings. The Islanders won the first two games in Buffalo, including a 2\u20131 victory in game two on\nBob Nystrom\n's goal in double overtime. They went on to win the series in six games and reach the finals for the first time in franchise history, where they would face the NHL's regular season champions, the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, who had gone undefeated for 35 straight games (25\u20130\u201310) during the regular season. In game one in\nPhiladelphia\n, the Islanders won 4\u20133 on\nDenis Potvin\n's power-play goal in overtime. Leading the series 3\u20132, they went home to Long Island for game six. In that game the Islanders blew a 4\u20132 lead in the third period but Nystrom continued his overtime heroics, scoring at 7:11 of the extra frame, on assists by John Tonelli and Lorne Henning, to bring Long Island its first Stanley Cup championship. This was the most recent Stanley Cup-clinching game won in overtime by the home team until the Los Angeles Kings did it in 2014. It was also the Islanders' sixth overtime victory of the playoffs. Bryan Trottier won the\nConn Smythe Trophy\nas the most valuable player in the playoffs. Torrey's strategy of building through the draft turned out very well; nearly all of the major contributors on the 1980 champions were home-grown Islanders or had spent most of their NHL careers in the Islanders organization. The Islanders were the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup with Europeans (\nStefan Persson\nand Kallur) on its roster.\n[\n33\n]\nThe Islanders dominated the next two seasons. Bossy scored\n50 goals in 50 games\nin\n1981\nand the Islanders lost only three playoff games en route to defeating the\nMinnesota North Stars\nin five games to win the Stanley Cup. Goring won the Conn Smythe Trophy. During their semifinals sweep of the Rangers, Islander fans began taunting the Rangers with a chant of \"\n1940!\n\"\u00a0\u2013 referring to the Rangers' last Stanley Cup win in\n1940\n(the Rangers would not win the cup again until\n1994\n). Fans in other NHL cities soon picked up the chant.\n[\n34\n]\nThese four banners hung in\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nand represent the four\nStanley Cup\nchampionships the Islanders won from 1980 through 1983.\nIn\n1981\u201382\n, the Islanders won a then-record 15 straight games en route to a franchise-record 118 points, while\nMike Bossy\nset a scoring record for right-wingers with 147 points in an 80-game schedule. The Islanders finished with the most points in the league (118), yet once in the playoffs against the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nthey found themselves down late in the third period of deciding game 5 before\nJohn Tonelli\nscored both the tying goal and the overtime winner. After defeating the Rangers in six games they swept both the\nQuebec Nordiques\nand the\nVancouver Canucks\nin the first-ever coast-to-coast\nStanley Cup Finals\nfor their third straight championship. During that series Bossy, upended by a check from\nTiger Williams\nand falling parallel to the ice, managed to hook the puck with his stick and score. Bossy netted the Stanley Cup-winning goal and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nThe next year, although the Islanders had won the Stanley Cup three straight times, more attention was being paid to the upstart\nEdmonton Oilers\n, whose young superstar\nWayne Gretzky\nhad just shattered existing scoring records.\n[\n35\n]\nIn\n1982\u201383\nthe Oilers had a better regular season, but the Islanders swept them in the\nStanley Cup Finals\nto win their fourth straight championship.\nBilly Smith\nwas named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner after shutting down the Oilers' vaunted scoring machine. Gretzky failed to score a goal during the series.\n[\n36\n]\nDuane and\nBrent Sutter\nscored seven and five points respectively in the first three games, while Bossy again scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in game four. After that game, the Oilers players walked past the Islanders' dressing room and were surprised to see the champions exhausted. Oilers players such as Gretzky and\nMark Messier\nsaid that they realized at that moment how much it would actually take to win the Stanley Cup.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\nPost-dynasty and the Easter Epic (1983\u20131991)\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders finished the\n1983\u201384 regular season\ntied atop the Prince of Wales Conference while successfully defending their Patrick Division title. The \"Drive for Five\" got off to a tense start. Late in the deciding game of their first-round series against the Rangers,\nDon Maloney\ntied the game with a controversial goal as the Islanders believed Maloney's stick was too high. They ultimately eliminated the Rangers for the fourth consecutive year. The team then defeated the\nWashington Capitals\nin five games and the\nMontreal Canadiens\nin six to set up a finals rematch with the Oilers. The series featured rookie\nPat LaFontaine\nscoring two third-period goals in 38 seconds. This time, the Oilers dethroned the Islanders to win the first of what would be five Stanley Cup victories in seven years. For the\n1984 playoffs\n, the NHL changed the home and away schedule for the finals, which provided the Islanders home-ice advantage in the series based on Wales Conference teams collectively having a winning record in regular season games versus Campbell Conference opponents,\n[\n38\n]\ndespite finishing lower than them in the overall standings. The new format had them play three straight games in Edmonton, where the Oilers managed to lock up the series, after the teams had split the first two games in New York. Bossy cited the team's hard time winning an away game as their downfall in the series.\n[\n39\n]\nThe Oilers also ended the Islanders' 19-series playoff winning streak. It remains the longest streak in the history of professional sports (one more than the 1959\u20131967 streak by the\nBoston Celtics\nof the NBA). Unlike the 1976\u20131979 Montreal Canadiens, who needed to win three series in the 1976 and 1977 playoffs under the playoff format in place at that time, the Islanders had to win four series in each of their Stanley Cup seasons.\nThe Islanders remained competitive for the rest of the decade, even as some of the stars from the Cup teams departed. As the decade wore on, Pickett began to keep the money from the team's cable deal rather than reinvest it in the team as he had done in years past. Although it did not become clear immediately, the lack of funds limited Torrey's ability to replace all of the departing talent. In the\n1984\u201385 NHL season\n, the Islanders slipped to third in their division, followed by similar results in the\n1985\u201386\nand\n1986\u201387\nseasons. They began facing stiff competition from division rivals, the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, who eliminated the Islanders in the division finals in 1985 and 1987, and the Capitals, who swept the Islanders' 1986 first-round series, the team's first exit without winning a playoff round since 1978.\nKelly Hrudey\n(pictured in 2006) saved 73 of 75 shots in the \"\nEaster Epic\n\" for the Islanders, who came out victorious after four periods of overtime play.\nIn 1986, Nystrom retired due to a serious injury\n[\n40\n]\nand\nClark Gillies\nwas picked up on waivers by the\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\n[\n41\n]\nArbour retired as coach following the\n1985\u201386 season\nand was replaced by longtime junior hockey coach\nTerry Simpson\n.\n[\n42\n]\nDuring the first round of the\n1987 playoffs\nagainst the Capitals, the Islanders had fallen behind in the series three games to one but were not eliminated due to a playoff format change from a best-of-5 series to a best-of-7.\n[\n43\n]\nThe Islanders evened the series, which set the stage for one of the most famous games in NHL history: the \"\nEaster Epic\n\".\nKelly Hrudey\nstopped 73 shots on goal while Pat LaFontaine scored at 8:47 of the fourth overtime\u2014and at 1:56\u00a0a.m. on\nEaster Sunday\nmorning. The win came even though the Islanders had been outshot 75\u201352.\n[\n44\n]\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\nThey were eliminated in the division finals in seven games by the Flyers.\n[\n47\n]\nChronic back pain forced\nMike Bossy\nto retire after the season.\n[\n48\n]\nThe\nfollowing season\n, the Islanders captured another division title,\n[\n49\n]\nbut were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the upstart\nNew Jersey Devils\n.\n[\n50\n]\nPotvin retired after the playoffs, holding records for most career goals (310), assists (742) and points (1052) by a defenseman, though he has since been passed in these categories by\nRay Bourque\nand\nPaul Coffey\n. Around this time, the team's run of good luck in the draft began to run out. Of their four top draft picks from 1987 to 1990, they lost one to a freak knee injury and two others never panned out.\n[\n51\n]\nThe\n1988\u201389 season\nsaw the Islanders win only seven of their first 27 games. Torrey fired Simpson and brought Arbour back. Arbour was unable to turn things around, and the team finished with 61 points, tied with the\nQuebec Nordiques\nfor the worst record in the league. It was their first losing season and the first time missing the playoffs since their second season. Smith, the last remaining original Islanders player, retired after the season to become the team's goaltending coach. Not long after the end of the season, Pickett moved to Florida and turned day-to-day operations over to a committee of four Long Island entrepreneurs: Ralph Palleschi, Bob Rosenthal,\nStephen Walsh\n, and\nPaul Greenwood\n. In return, they each bought a 2.5% interest in the team.\n[\n51\n]\nIn the\nnext season\n, the Islanders rebounded to get back into the playoffs, but fell to the Rangers in five games of the opening round. The team bought out the remaining years of\nBryan Trottier\n's contract, sending him off with a team record of games played. The\n1990\u201391 season\nhad the team finish well out of the playoffs after winning only 25 games.\nNew faces and the 1993 run (1991\u20131995)\n[\nedit\n]\nLaFontaine was frustrated with the team's lack of success and the progress of his contract negotiations, and held out rather than report to camp before\n1991\u201392\n. In response to the holdout, Torrey engineered a rebuilding project with two blockbuster trades on October 25, 1991. He dealt LaFontaine,\nRandy Wood\nand\nRandy Hillier\n(along with future considerations) to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin return for\nPierre Turgeon\n,\nBenoit Hogue\n,\nUwe Krupp\nand\nDave McLlwain\n. He also sent longtime captain\nBrent Sutter\nand\nBrad Lauer\nto the\nChicago Blackhawks\nfor\nSteve Thomas\nand\nAdam Creighton\n. With these additions and a talented core of players such as\nDerek King\n,\nRay Ferraro\n, and\nPatrick Flatley\n, along with incoming\nSoviet\nplayers\nVladimir Malakhov\nand\nDarius Kasparaitis\n, the Islanders had a new foundation in the early 1990s. The management committee, however, was not nearly as patient as Boe and Pickett had been, and forced Torrey to resign after the Islanders missed the playoffs again that season. Assistant general manager\nDon Maloney\nwas hired in Torrey's place,\n[\n51\n]\nwhile Torrey quickly resurfaced with the expansion\nFlorida Panthers\n.\nIn Maloney's first year,\n1992\u201393\n, the Islanders rebounded to make the playoffs, in the process surpassing the 80-point mark for the first time in five years. The LaFontaine-Turgeon trade proved successful for both the Islanders and Sabres, as both players hit career highs in points and Turgeon won the\nLady Byng Trophy\n.\nRay Ferraro emerged as a playoff hero, scoring a pair of overtime winners in the first-round series against the Capitals. Instead of celebrating after winning game 6 at Nassau Coliseum, however, the Islanders were both irate and despondent. Only seconds after Turgeon, the team's star center and leading scorer, scored an insurance goal in the series-clinching game,\nDale Hunter\nviolently checked him from behind. Turgeon was believed to be out for the entire second round, if not longer, with a separated shoulder. He returned only for spot power-play duty in the last game of the second round. Hunter received a 21-game suspension, at the time the longest for on-ice misconduct in modern NHL history.\nThe Islanders' next opponent, the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, were twice-defending Stanley Cup champions and full of stars such as\nMario Lemieux\n,\nJaromir Jagr\n, and\nRon Francis\n. The Penguins had roared through the regular season with 119 points, as well as recording a record 17 consecutive wins towards the end of the season, and were overwhelmingly favored to win a third straight championship. Jim Smith of\nNewsday\npredicted that with Turgeon on the sidelines, the Penguins would sweep the Islanders out of the playoffs, however on the strength of outstanding goaltending from\nGlenn Healy\nand contributions from all four lines, the Islanders achieved a huge upset when\nDavid Volek\nscored at 5:16 of overtime of the deciding seventh game.\nNewsday'\ns front page the day following the win was a picture of Healy with a headline reading, \"It's a Miracle!\" This was the last playoff series won by the Islanders for 23 years, until the 2015\u201316 season. Turgeon returned to the Islanders' top line for the conference finals against the\nMontreal Canadiens\n, though he was not in peak form as he had not fully recovered. The Islanders bowed out of the playoffs after a hard-fought five games, two of which went to overtime. After beating the Islanders, the Canadiens went on to win the Cup.\nMaloney had avoided making many personnel changes his first year, but on the eve of the\n1993 expansion draft\nhe traded backup goaltender\nMark Fitzpatrick\nto the\nQuebec Nordiques\nfor\nRon Hextall\n. The clubs also exchanged first-round picks in the deal. Able to protect only one netminder in the expansion draft, the Islanders left Healy exposed. He was claimed by the\nMighty Ducks of Anaheim\n, then was claimed by the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nin Phase II of the draft the next day, and finally had his rights traded to the Rangers, where he became the backup.\nThe Islanders barely squeezed past the Panthers to make the 1994 playoffs before being swept in a lopsided opening series by the first-place Rangers, who went on to win the Cup. It would be the Islanders' last playoff appearance until\n2002\n. Arbour retired for good as coach and was succeeded by longtime assistant\nLorne Henning\n. Hextall, who allowed 16 goals in three games, drew most of the criticism for the failed playoff campaign and was shipped to Philadelphia for\nTommy Soderstrom\nin September. In the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season, the Islanders not only failed to qualify for the playoffs, they finished ahead of only the third-year\nOttawa Senators\n.\nManagement issues (1995\u20132000)\n[\nedit\n]\nBy the end of the 1994\u201395 season, Maloney was under considerable heat from the press and fan base for his handling of the team. Since taking over in 1992, the only noticeable attempt he made to upgrade the roster was the acquisition of Hextall. Near the end of the failed 1995 campaign, Maloney decided that the core of players he had left alone for three seasons needed to be revamped, leading to a rebuilding project. He traded Turgeon and Malakhov to the\nMontreal Canadiens\nfor\nKirk Muller\nand\nMathieu Schneider\n, while Hogue was sent to\nToronto\nfor young goaltender\nEric Fichaud\n. Additionally, Maloney allowed the team's leading scorer, Ferraro, to depart as an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of the season. Fans' displeasure at Maloney for trading the popular Turgeon was magnified when Muller balked at joining a rebuilding team. He played 45 games for the Islanders before being sent to Toronto as well.\nBefore the\n1995\u201396 season\n, Maloney fired Henning and named\nMike Milbury\nhead coach. The same year, the Islanders' attempt at updating their look resulted in the unveiling of a new team logo of a slicker-clad fisherman holding a hockey stick. Islanders fans disliked it, and rival Rangers' fans mockingly called the Islanders \"\nfishsticks\n\"\u2014mocking how the logo resembled the\nGorton's Fisherman\n. The team reverted to a modified version of the old logo as soon as the league allowed them to do so. (In spite of this, the logo found renewed popularity as a throwback design in the late 2010s and early 2020s, enough so that the team would revive it as their third \"Reverse Retro\" jersey in 2022 and would use an adjusted version of the logo for their AHL team, the\nBridgeport Islanders\n, beginning in 2024.) The year was a disappointment on the ice as well, as the Islanders finished in last place with a record of 22\u201350\u201310. During the season, team management fired Maloney, whom fans blamed for the team's downfall,\n[\n52\n]\nand gave Milbury full control of hockey operations as both a coach and general manager. Milbury went on to resign as head coach during the\nfollowing season\nand elevated assistant\nRick Bowness\nto the position. After another unsuccessful season with little improvement, Milbury took over as coach again during the\n1997\u201398 season\n. The team improved to fourth place in their division but again failed to make the playoffs. Milbury followed by once again stepping down as coach during the\nfollowing season\nwhile retaining his job as general manager.\nDuring the continued playoff drought, instability in the front office mirrored the Islanders' substandard performance on the ice. Pickett sold the team to\nDallas\nbusinessman\nJohn Spano\nin 1996. However, three months after the 1997 closing, Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of the first installment on the cable rights deal. Several Islanders executives tipped off\nNewsday\nthat something was amiss about their new boss.\n[\n53\n]\nIn July,\nNewsday\nexposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required to complete the deal. The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth, and also had two lawsuits pending against him. Within days of the report, Spano was forced to relinquish the team to Pickett. Federal prosecutors turned up evidence that Spano had forged many of the documents used to vouch for his wealth and to promise payment to Pickett, and even appeared to have sent many of the documents from his own office in Dallas. He was sentenced to 71 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. The NHL took additional heat when reports surfaced that the league spent well under $1,000 (depending on the source, the league spent either $525\n[\n53\n]\nor $750\n[\n51\n]\n) to check Spano's background. It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners. The incident and its aftermath were covered in the\nESPN\n30 for 30\ndocumentary,\nBig Shot\n.\n[\n54\n]\nPickett finally found a buyer, a group led by\nHoward Milstein\nand\nPhoenix Coyotes\nco-owner Steven Gluckstern, a deal which almost fell through when\nSpectacor Management Group\n, which managed the Coliseum for Nassau County, tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was safe. Pickett refused, since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in recent seasons. SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders, the NHL, and Nassau County officials.\nInitially, the team made numerous trades and increased their payroll in an effort to assemble a better team. In one transaction, young players\nTodd Bertuzzi\nand\nBryan McCabe\nwere traded for veteran\nTrevor Linden\n. After the Islanders finished 12 points short of the playoffs in the 1997\u201398 season, however, Milstein and Gluckstern decided to run the team on an austere budget in an attempt to make a profit. They also complained about the condition of the Nassau Coliseum and made noises about moving the team elsewhere. They began trading or releasing many popular players to avoid paying their salaries, including star scorer\nZigmund Palffy\n, team captain Linden, former rookie of the year\nBryan Berard\n, and rugged defenseman\nRich Pilon\n. Losing the highly regarded players, the team finished with similar results the next two seasons. Attendance, which had been in a steady decline over the past few years, decreased even further to under 12,000 per game. Around that time, Milstein bid hundreds of millions of dollars in unsuccessful attempts to purchase the\nNational Football League\n's\nWashington Redskins\nand\nCleveland Browns\n.\nNew ownership and a return to the playoffs (2000\u20132006)\n[\nedit\n]\nLet's face it, the Coliseum is a dump, and the team, well, they're losers. It's a real shame. We want to see it change because this is our home. We all deserve better.\n\u2014\nCharles Wang\n[\n55\n]\nIn 2000, Milstein and Gluckstern sold the team to\nComputer Associates\nexecutives\nCharles Wang\nand\nSanjay Kumar\n. The sale cost $187.5\u00a0million ($342.36\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) and gave fans hope for the team to turn its lack of success around.\n[\n55\n]\nThe new owners allowed Milbury to spend money and invest in free agents. His first attempt proved unpopular with fans, as he traded away future star players\nRoberto Luongo\nand\nOlli Jokinen\nto the\nFlorida Panthers\nfor\nOleg Kvasha\nand\nMark Parrish\n. Milbury then further surprised the hockey world when he took\nRick DiPietro\nwith the first selection in the\n2000 draft\n, ahead of consensus picks\nDany Heatley\nand\nMarian Gaborik\n. Reporters and fans were alternately confused and enraged by the moves, which Milbury acknowledged, saying, \"As dangerous as this may be, we think Mad Mike maybe has something going for him.\"\n[\n56\n]\nEstablishing a record of controversial decisions, Milbury held onto the \"Mad Mike\" nickname for years to follow. He remained adamant that his moves were to immediately improve the team, whose poor winning percentage that year was ahead of only the franchise's first season.\n[\n57\n]\nThe team's uninspired play led Milbury to fire head coach and past player\nButch Goring\n. Fans vocalized their dislike of Goring taking the fall rather than Milbury, which was further worsened when Milbury passed on hiring\nTed Nolan\nas Goring's successor; Instead,\nBoston Bruins\nassistant coach\nPeter Laviolette\nwas hired.\n[\n58\n]\nThe Islanders acquired\nAlexei Yashin\n(left) prior to the\n2001\u201302 season\n. Yashin would go on to become the team's captain in later years.\nThree key personnel acquisitions were made prior to the 2001\u201302 season, Laviolette's first.\nAlexei Yashin\nwas acquired from the\nOttawa Senators\nin exchange for forward\nBill Muckalt\n, defenseman\nZdeno Chara\nand the Islanders' second overall pick in the\n2001 draft\n. Next, Islanders prospects\nTim Connolly\nand\nTaylor Pyatt\nwere traded to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin exchange for\nMichael Peca\n, who became the team's captain.\n[\n59\n]\n[\n60\n]\nBy virtue of finishing with the worst record in the previous season,\nDetroit Red Wings\ngoaltender\nChris Osgood\nwas the next addition, taken as the first pick in the September 2001 waiver draft, adding a former Stanley Cup championship goaltender without giving up any players in exchange.\n[\n61\n]\nThe additions proved to be a great help, as the team opened the season with a 9\u20130\u20131\u20131 record, the best in franchise history. They finished the season with new broken records; their 96 points marked the fourth biggest one-year turnaround in the league's history (44 points higher than the previous season), while Osgood's 66 starts surpassed\nRon Hextall\n's previous record of 65.\n[\n22\n]\nDuring the\n2002 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, they were seeded fifth and faced the fourth-seeded\nToronto Maple Leafs\n. The Islanders lost in a very physical first-round series in seven games; the home team won every game of the series. Notably, game 5 featured\nGary Roberts\ncharging Islander defenseman\nKenny Jonsson\n, and\nDarcy Tucker\nsubmarining Peca with a questionable check that tore the Islander captain's\nanterior cruciate ligament\n, sidelining both players for the series' final game. The situation between Tucker and Peca caused a bit of outrage, with speculation that Tucker had intended to injure Peca before the game had begun, which Tucker denied.\n[\n62\n]\nDespite the promise shown in the Toronto playoff series, the Islanders had a slow start to the\n2002\u201303 season\n. They rebounded to make the playoffs, but lost a five-game series in the first round to the top-seeded\nOttawa Senators\n.\n[\n63\n]\nMilbury continued his controversial move-making by firing Laviolette after the season, citing postseason interviews with the players in which they expressed a lack of confidence in the coach.\n[\n64\n]\nHe was replaced with\nSteve Stirling\n, who had previously been coaching the team's top minor league affiliate, the\nBridgeport Sound Tigers\n. In the\nfollowing season\n, the Islanders again lost in the first round of the playoffs, this time to the eventual champion\nTampa Bay Lightning\n.\n[\n65\n]\nFollowing the\n2004\u201305 NHL lockout\n, which eliminated that season of play, the Islanders made several player moves to increase offense for\nfollowing season\n. Peca was traded to the\nEdmonton Oilers\nfor center\nMike York\n, freeing up room under the NHL's new salary cap.\n[\n66\n]\nThe same day, the team signed winger\nMiroslav Satan\nto play alongside Yashin.\n[\n67\n]\nMilbury also worked on remaking the team's defense, adding\nAlexei Zhitnik\n,\nBrad Lukowich\nand\nBrent Sopel\nto replace the departed\nAdrian Aucoin\nand\nRoman Hamrlik\n, who left as free agents, and Jonsson, who left the NHL to play in the\nHockeyAllsvenskan\nin Sweden.\n[\n68\n]\nIn the aftermath, Yashin was named as the team's new captain.\n[\n69\n]\nThe team's inconsistent play led to Stirling's dismissal midway through the season.\n[\n14\n]\nManagement shake-ups and the DiPietro contract (2006\u20132009)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn the day of Stirling's firing, January 11, 2006, Milbury also announced that he would step down as general manager once a successor was found.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n70\n]\nHe served as vice president of Wang's sports properties for one year before resigning in May 2007.\n[\n71\n]\nWang proceeded by hiring\nNeil Smith\nas general manager and\nTed Nolan\nas head coach, following a brief stint by\nBrad Shaw\nas the team's interim head coach.\n[\n72\n]\n[\n73\n]\nSmith, however, was fired after approximately one month and quickly replaced by the team's backup goaltender\nGarth Snow\n, who retired from his playing career to accept the position.\n[\n22\n]\nBefore his dismissal, Smith made several free agent acquisitions, including defensemen\nBrendan Witt\nand\nTom Poti\n, and forwards\nMike Sillinger\nand\nChris Simon\n.\n[\n72\n]\nOn September 12, 2006, the Islanders signed DiPietro to a 15-year, $67.5\u00a0million ($105.28\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) contract, which was believed to be the longest contract to date in the NHL and the second-longest in North American sports, behind a 25-year contract for\nNational Basketball Association\nplayer\nMagic Johnson\n.\n[\n74\n]\n[\n75\n]\nDiPietro, Wang and Snow all spoke confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides, despite the mixed reactions it received from the rest of the hockey world. Specifically, Wang stated, \"This is not a big deal. You have to have a commitment to who you're working with.\"\n[\n74\n]\nAs speculation began as to whether other teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players,\nAtlanta Thrashers\n' general manager\nDon Waddell\nfelt that, \"It's highly unlikely that you will see teams go beyond that. This is a once-in-a-lifetime contract. Ownership must feel very strongly that he's their guy for the next 15 years.\"\n[\n75\n]\nBill Guerin\nwas the team captain from 2007 to 2009.\nThe new-look Islanders were picked by most analysts to languish towards the bottom of the standings.\n[\n76\n]\nEyeing a playoff spot, Snow traded for forward\nRyan Smyth\nfrom the\nEdmonton Oilers\nat the trade deadline on February 27, 2007.\n[\n77\n]\nInjuries to DiPietro provided extra setbacks, but not enough to drop the team from playoff contention.\n[\n78\n]\n[\n79\n]\nThey qualified for the playoffs, assisted by a late-season winning streak and a 3\u20132 shootout victory against the\nNew Jersey Devils\nin their final regular season game.\n[\n80\n]\nDespite DiPietro's return to the team in time for the playoffs, the team lost their first round matchup in five games to the\nPresidents' Trophy\n-winning\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\n[\n81\n]\nManagement announced in June 2007 that they would buy out captain\nAlexei Yashin\n's contract, which had four seasons remaining on it.\n[\n82\n]\nFree agents Smyth, Poti,\nViktor Kozlov\n,\nJason Blake\n, and\nRichard Zednik\nalso left in July 2007.\n[\n83\n]\n[\n84\n]\nDuring that month, the Islanders signed\nBill Guerin\nto a two-year contract as he immediately assumed team captaincy.\n[\n83\n]\nAlso in the off-season, free agents\nMike Comrie\n,\nAndy Sutton\nand\nJon Sim\njoined the team.\n[\n85\n]\n[\n86\n]\nThat summer, it was announced that Nolan extended an invitation to Al Arbour to return as a coach for one game in order to bring his total number of games coached to 1,500.\n[\n87\n]\n[\n88\n]\nArbour signed a one-day contract, the shortest in league history, on November 3, 2007; it put him behind the bench the following day as the Islanders defeated the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n3\u20132, raising his career coaching win total to 740.\n[\n89\n]\nThe team remained in the playoff hunt through the trade deadline as they re-signed Comrie to a one-year contract and traded away Simon and\nMarc-Andre Bergeron\n.\n[\n90\n]\nA rash of injuries saw them plummet to the fifth-worst record in the league by the end of the season.\n[\n91\n]\nJosh Bailey\nwas drafted by the Islanders in 2008, to provide depth at the wing for the team.\nAt the\n2008 NHL entry draft\n, the Islanders made two trades to move down from the fifth to the ninth overall pick, with which they selected center\nJosh Bailey\n. They also added free agents\nMark Streit\nand\nDoug Weight\n. The team dismissed head coach\nTed Nolan\nover alleged philosophy differences,\n[\n92\n]\n[\n93\n]\nand later that summer replaced him with\nScott Gordon\n.\n[\n94\n]\nNear the trade deadline, Snow traded Comrie and\nChris Campoli\nto the\nOttawa Senators\nin exchange for forward\nDean McAmmond\nand the\nSan Jose Sharks\n' first-round draft pick in the\n2009 NHL entry draft\nand sent captain Bill Guerin to the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin exchange for a conditional draft pick.\n[\n95\n]\n[\n96\n]\nIn the\n2008\u201309 season\n, the Islanders finished in last place in the league with a record of 26\u201347\u20139, which was the team's worst record since the 2000\u201301 season. After the conclusion of regular season, they won the draft lottery to retain the first overall pick in the\n2009 NHL entry draft\n.\n[\n97\n]\nThe Tavares era begins (2009\u20132015)\n[\nedit\n]\nBeginning an effort to rebuild the team with new and young talent, the Islanders selected\nJohn Tavares\nwith the first-overall pick of the\n2009 NHL entry draft\n.\n[\n98\n]\nTavares went into the draft as the top prospect in the majority of scouting reports,\n[\n99\n]\nand it was widely expected that the Islanders would select him after they secured the first overall pick by winning the draft lottery, although there was plenty of competition between Tavares,\nVictor Hedman\n, and\nMatt Duchene\n.\n[\n100\n]\nNHL Central Scouting Bureau\n's Chris Edwards spoke highly of him, stating, \"[Tavares] is phenomenal at getting the puck through traffic to his linemates, getting to opening. The way he reads the play and can get to where he figures the rebounds will be and bangs in the rebound. He's a real smart player.\"\n[\n101\n]\nThey traded up twice in the first round to also select defenseman\nCalvin de Haan\nwith the 12th overall pick,\n[\n102\n]\nas well as\nCasey Cizikas\nand\nAnders Lee\nin later rounds, all of whom would go on to play consistently on the main roster by the\n2014\u201315 season\n.\n[\n103\n]\nThe\n2009\u201310 season\nstarted out slow, with the team winless its first six games.\n[\n104\n]\nThe team continued to play inconsistently due to injuries as many wrote them off as potential playoff contenders.\n[\n105\n]\nThe team hit a mid-season hot streak,\n[\n106\n]\nhowever nine losses in 11 games before the Olympic break set them right back.\n[\n107\n]\nThey ultimately ended up at bottom of the standings again, finishing the season 26th in the league.\n[\n108\n]\nThe placement led to a fifth overall pick in\n2010\n. Continuing with their rebuilding process, they used the first round to draft young forwards\nNino Niederreiter\nand\nBrock Nelson\nwith picks five and 30, respectively.\n[\n109\n]\nAs the\n2010\u201311 season\ngot underway, the team quickly fell into a ten-game losing streak, leading to the firing of head coach\nScott Gordon\n.\n[\n110\n]\n[\n111\n]\nHe was replaced on an interim basis by\nJack Capuano\n, who had been coaching the Bridgeport Sound Tigers.\n[\n111\n]\n[\n112\n]\nEarly in the season, they also acquired\nMichael Grabner\nfrom waivers, who went on to score 34 goals and was selected as a finalist for the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n;\n[\n113\n]\n[\n114\n]\nhe would go on to sign a five-year contract with the team at the end of the season.\n[\n114\n]\nThis year also featured the\nPenguins\u2013Islanders brawl\n, which resulted in a combined 346 penalty minutes and a $100,000 fine to the Islanders for \"failure to control their players\".\nJohn Tavares\n, was named an alternate captain for the\n2011\u201312 season\n. He was later named the team captain in 2013.\nThe\nfollowing season\nwas a breakout year for Tavares. The newly named assistant captain gained 31 goals and 50 assists,\n[\n115\n]\nin addition to being selected to play in the\n59th NHL All-Star Game\nat the age of 21;\n[\n116\n]\nhis 81 points were seventh-best in the league.\n[\n117\n]\nTavares' left-winger\nMatt Moulson\nalso had a strong season, finishing with career highs of 36 goals, 33 assists and 69 points.\n[\n118\n]\nDespite strong seasons from their top players, the team finished 27th in the league with a record of 34\u201337\u201311, continuing their pattern of racking up top prospects with early picks at the drafts.\n[\n119\n]\nThey used the first round of the\n2012 draft\nto select defenseman\nGriffin Reinhart\nwith the fourth overall pick.\n[\n120\n]\nOn August 1, 2011, voters in\nNassau County\nrejected a proposal for a new arena to replace Nassau Coliseum. This followed the failed decade-long attempt by owner Charles Wang to build a mixed-use development called\nThe Lighthouse Project\n, which would have renovated the arena.\n[\n121\n]\nIn the wake of the vote, speculation began that the team would eventually move to\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\n, new arenas in\nQueens\nor\nSuffolk County\n, the\nSprint Center\nin\nKansas City\n, or the\nVideotron Centre\nin\nQuebec City\n, the last of which was coincidentally set to open at the same time as the expiration of the Islanders' lease on the Nassau Coliseum in 2015.\n[\n122\n]\n[\n123\n]\n[\n124\n]\nOn October 24, 2012, the Islanders made the announcement that the franchise would indeed be moving to the\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\nfor the 2015\u201316 NHL season, after signing a lease that would keep the team in the arena until 2040. The team retained its name, logo and colors as part of the move.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n125\n]\nAs part of the deal, the management of Barclays Center took over the team's business operations once the Islanders moved to Barclays Center.\n[\n126\n]\nThe decision to move to Brooklyn didn't require the Rangers' approval. Under a longstanding provision of the agreement that allowed the Islanders to share the New York area with the Rangers, the Islanders are allowed to play their games anywhere on Long Island, including the two city boroughs on the island, Brooklyn and\nQueens\n.\n[\n127\n]\nBeginning on April 1, 2013, of the\n2012\u201313 season\n, the team went on a near month-long unbeaten streak in regulation time, posting a 12-game streak of earning points until falling to the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nlater that month.\n[\n128\n]\nDuring that streak, on April 23, 2013, they clinched their first playoff berth since 2007 with a 4\u20133 shootout loss to the\nCarolina Hurricanes\n, ending a six-year playoff drought.\n[\n128\n]\n[\n129\n]\nBehind goaltender\nEvgeni Nabokov\n, the team was ultimately eliminated in six games by the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin the first round of the\nplayoffs\n, continuing their winless streak in playoff series.\n[\n130\n]\n[\n131\n]\nOn September 10, 2013, Tavares was introduced as the 14th captain in New York Islanders history, replacing former Islander Mark Streit of the Philadelphia Flyers, who served as team captain since 2011.\n[\n132\n]\nAfter posting a 4\u20134\u20133 record in their first 11 games, the Islanders made a trade, sending fan favorite and three-time 30-goal scorer Matt Moulson, their 2014 first-round draft pick and their 2015 second-round draft pick to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin exchange for\nThomas Vanek\n, a highly regarded and dynamic goal scorer.\n[\n133\n]\n[\n134\n]\nDespite chemistry with linemates Tavares and\nKyle Okposo\n, however, his desire to test free agency and the team's impending move to\nBarclays Center\n[\n135\n]\nled to Vanek being dealt to the\nMontreal Canadiens\nat the trade deadline for\nSebastian Collberg\nand a second-round pick in\n2014\n.\n[\n136\n]\n[\n137\n]\nAfter a season of player swapping and goaltending issues, they failed to qualify for the\nplayoffs\n, finishing with a record of 34\u201337\u201311.\n[\n138\n]\nThe Islanders acquired\nNick Leddy\nthrough a trade with the\nChicago Blackhawks\nduring the 2014 off-season.\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Islanders made several moves to improve the team before their\nfinal season\nat Nassau Coliseum. In May, the Islanders acquired the rights to\nJaroslav Halak\nfrom the\nWashington Capitals\nin exchange for a fourth-round pick in 2014. Halak was then signed to a four-year contract. The Islanders also signed\nMikhail Grabovski\n,\nNikolai Kulemin\nand goaltender\nChad Johnson\nas free agents. Additionally, on October 4, the Islanders acquired\nJohnny Boychuk\nfrom the\nBoston Bruins\nfor two-second round picks in 2014 and\n2015\nand a conditional third-round pick in 2015, as well as\nNick Leddy\nfrom the\nChicago Blackhawks\nin exchange for prospect\nVille Pokka\n,\nT. J. Brennan\nand the rights to\nAnders Nilsson\n.\nThe NHL Board of Governors approved the Islanders' sale to businessmen\nJon Ledecky\nand\nScott D. Malkin\nin October 2014. Ledecky and Malkin served as minority partners during a two-year transition period. At the end of the 2015\u201316 season, they formally took majority control from Wang, who retained a share of the franchise.\n[\n139\n]\nThe Islanders finished the 2014\u201315 regular season with a record of 47\u201328\u20137 for 101 points, and met the Washington Capitals in the first round of the\n2015 playoffs\n. The Capitals held home-ice advantage in the series after the Islanders lost their final regular season game to the\nColumbus Blue Jackets\n, 5\u20134, in a shootout, as the Islanders lost the season series to the Capitals after posting a 2\u20131\u20131 record in the season series (Washington went 2\u20130\u20132, winning the season series with six points to the Islanders' five). On April 19, 2015, in the third game of their first-round series against Washington, John Tavares scored 15 seconds into overtime to win the game for the Islanders, 2\u20131. It was the second-shortest overtime playoff game in Islanders history, and was the first overtime, game-winning goal for the Islanders in the playoffs since 1993. The Islanders lost the fourth and fifth games of their series before rebounding in the sixth game to force a seventh game in the series. However, they were denied entry into the second round by a single goal and would ultimately fall to the Capitals in seven games. As a result, game 6 was the Islanders' last game at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum; the Isles'\nCal Clutterbuck\nscored the final NHL goal in the building's first run prior to the Islanders' return in 2018.\nMove to Barclays Center and playoff series win (2015\u20132017)\n[\nedit\n]\nIn June 2015, the Islanders entered the\n2015 draft\nwithout a first-round pick, but emerged with two first-rounders in\nMathew Barzal\nand\nAnthony Beauvillier\nafter a series of draft day trades.\n[\n140\n]\nThe Islanders also selected forward\nAndong Song\nin the sixth round of the 2015 draft, making him the first Chinese player to be drafted by an NHL team.\n[\n141\n]\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\n. The Islanders played their home games there from 2015 to 2020.\nThe Islanders played their first regular season game at\nBarclays Center\non October 9, 2015, losing 3\u20132 in overtime to the\nChicago Blackhawks\n.\nArtem Anisimov\nscored the first regular season goal, while Tavares scored the first regular season Islanders goal. The Islanders posted the fourth-best penalty kill rate and allowed the fewest power-play goals during the season. However, in the last quarter of the regular season, some players, including Halak and defenseman\nTravis Hamonic\n, suffered key injuries. The team finished the regular season fourth in the Metropolitan Division with 100 points, enough to clinch the first wild card spot in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced off against the\nFlorida Panthers\n; goaltender\nThomas Greiss\nonly played in 40 minutes of playoff hockey with the\nSan Jose Sharks\nprior to this series. Both teams split the first four games of the series. The fifth game of the series proved to be a major turning point, as late season call-up\nAlan Quine\nscored the game-winning goal on the power play with four minutes left in double overtime to end the second-longest game in franchise history; that goal gave them a 3\u20132 series lead and a chance to clinch the series on home ice. In the sixth game, the Islanders trailed 1\u20130 for much of the game, but Tavares tied it late in the third period. Tavares would score again with the series-clinching goal in double overtime to give the Islanders their first playoff series win since 1993. In the second round of the playoffs, they faced the Tampa Bay Lightning for the first time since 2004.

Having carried three goaltenders for the second consecutive season, the decision was made to stick with the tandem of Greiss and back-up\nJean-Francois Berube\nafter Halak posted a 6\u20138\u20135 record with a .904 save percentage through the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season.\n[\n145\n]\nIn late January 2017, following a report by\nBloomberg News\nwhich speculated that Barclays Center was considering removing the Islanders due to poor attendance and effects on the venue's profit margins (reception to Barclays Center as a hockey venue was mixed partly due to obstructed view seats,\n[\n146\n]\nas well as features like an off-center scoreboard, and the Islanders had the third-worst average attendance in the entire league while playing at the venue),\nNewsday\nreported that Nassau County executive Edward Mangano had met with one of the team's co-owners, and told the paper that it was possible that the Islanders could return to the renovated Nassau Coliseum.\n[\n147\n]\n[\n148\n]\nHowever, commissioner\nGary Bettman\nconsidered the concept to be \"unviable\" (the renovation reduced the capacity of the arena to just under 14,000, which is smaller than any NHL arena), and noted that Ledecky and Malkin were pursuing a possible arena project at\nBelmont Park\n.\n[\n149\n]\nDespite winning their last six games of the 2016\u201317 season, the Islanders finished in ninth place in the Eastern Conference; they missed the playoffs by only one point when the Toronto Maple Leafs clinched the final playoff spot on the penultimate day of the season.\nEmergence of Barzal and management overhaul (2017\u2013present)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn February 9, 2018, rookie\nMathew Barzal\nrecorded his third five-point game, becoming only the second rookie to do so since\nJoe Malone\nin 1917\u201318 and tying a 100-year-old record in the process.\n[\n150\n]\nAt the end of the 2017\u201318 regular season, Barzal had 85 points (22 goals, 63 assists). He led his team and all NHL rookies in points, and was tied for 13th overall in scoring in the NHL. Barzal was the seventh rookie in NHL history, and first since\nSidney Crosby\nin 2005\u201306, to have scored at least 20 goals and 60 assists in a single season.\n[\n151\n]\nBarzal also tied Islanders legend,\nBryan Trottier\n's franchise record for rookie assists.\n[\n152\n]\nBarzal won the Calder Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year for his 85-point season, leading the closest candidate by 20 points and receiving 160 out of 164 first-place votes. Barzal was the first Islanders' player to win the award since\nBryan Berard\nin 1997, and he was the fifth Islanders' player overall to win the trophy, joining Islanders legends\nMike Bossy\n(1978), Trottier (1976), and\nDenis Potvin\n(1974).\n[\n151\n]\nIslanders players after a win against the\nColorado Avalanche\non January 6, 2020\nDuring the 2018 off-season, the Islanders announced that former\nNew Jersey Devils\nand\nToronto Maple Leafs\ngeneral manager\nLou Lamoriello\nwas named their president of hockey operations, with \"full authority over all hockey matters with the organization\", and would become general manager on June 5, 2018, replacing\nGarth Snow\n.\n[\n153\n]\n[\n154\n]\nAdditionally,\nBarry Trotz\nwas hired as head coach of the Islanders. Trotz resigned from the Washington Capitals one month prior after coaching them to their first Stanley Cup championship since they entered the NHL in 1974.\n[\n155\n]\nCaptain John Tavares' contract with the team expired following the 2017\u201318 season, and despite attempts to re-sign him,\n[\n155\n]\nhe joined the Toronto Maple Leafs as a free agent.\n[\n156\n]\nIn the 2018\u201319 season, the Islanders split their home games between Barclays Center and their former home, Nassau Coliseum. The use of both arenas would continue over the course of the following two seasons until the completion of a new 18,000-seat arena at\nBelmont Park\nin\nElmont\n.\n[\n157\n]\n[\n158\n]\n[\n159\n]\nThe Islanders enjoyed success throughout the 2018\u201319 season, clinching a playoff berth at home for the first time in 17 years, and the first time in March since 1990.\n[\n160\n]\n[\n161\n]\n[\n162\n]\nNassau Coliseum hosted their home playoff games during the first round while the Barclays Center hosted their home games for the rest of the playoffs.\n[\n159\n]\n[\n163\n]\nIn the first round of the\n2019 playoffs\n, the Islanders swept the Pittsburgh Penguins, and in the second round the team was swept by the\nCarolina Hurricanes\n.\n[\n164\n]\nSince November 2021, the Islanders have played their home games at UBS Arena in\nElmont, New York\n.\nOn August 8, 2019, the\nEmpire State Development Corporation\nboard (ESD) voted unanimously in favor of the Belmont Park Arena project.\n[\n165\n]\nIn February 2020, it was announced that the Islanders would return to Nassau Coliseum for the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs and the 2020\u201321 season until\nUBS Arena\nwas opened.\n[\n166\n]\n[\n167\n]\nBoth the 2019\u201320 season and the construction of the new arena were interrupted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n. When the NHL season was suspended on March 12, 2020, the Islanders had twelve regular season games remaining and were one point shy of the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\n[\n168\n]\nThe Islanders qualified for the NHL Return-to-Play initiative as the seventh seed, beating the\nFlorida Panthers\nin four games in a best-of-5 qualifying round to make the\n2020 Stanley Cup playoffs\n. They would then go on to defeat the\nWashington Capitals\nin the first round in five games. Then, after blowing a 3\u20131 series lead to the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nthat extended the series to seven games, the Islanders would go on to win game 7 against the Flyers and advance to the conference finals for the first time since the\n1993 playoffs\n. However, their run would come to an end at the hands of the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nin six games. In December 2020, New York Islanders Hockey Club, L.P. bought the remaining 15 percent stake of the team from the\nestate of Charles Wang\nand took full ownership of the team.\n[\n169\n]\n[\n170\n]\n[\n171\n]\nThe Islanders again made the playoffs in the shortened 2020\u201321 season, defeating the Penguins and Bruins each in six games. They again lost to the Tampa Bay Lightning, this time in seven.\nThe Islanders started the 2021\u201322 season on a 13-game road trip while\nUBS Arena\nwas finalizing construction, finishing their road trip with a 5\u20136\u20132 record.\n[\n172\n]\nHowever, minutes before the first home game of the season on November 20, 2021, many Islander players contracted COVID-19 and missed the home opener and several others. Longest tenured Islander\nJosh Bailey\nand team captain\nAnders Lee\nmissed the game, while\nAdam Pelech\n,\nAnthony Beauvillier\n, and\nAndy Greene\nwere ruled out minutes before puck drop.\n[\n173\n]\nThey lost the home opener to the\nCalgary Flames\nby a score of 5\u20132.\n[\n174\n]\nBrad Richardson\nscored the first goal in UBS Arena history, while\nBrock Nelson\nscored the first Islander goal.\n[\n174\n]\nThe Islanders won their first game at UBS Arena against the Devils, on December 11, by a score of 4\u20132. Former Devils captain\nZach Parise\nscored the game-winning goal for the Islanders.\n[\n175\n]\nThe Islanders missed the playoffs after three consecutive trips, finishing the season with a 37\u201335\u201310 record.\n[\n176\n]\nOn May 9, 2022, head coach Barry Trotz was relieved from his duties,\n[\n177\n]\nand replaced with\nLane Lambert\n.\n[\n178\n]\nIn the\nnext season\n, the Islanders finished as the first wild card, but were defeated by the Carolina Hurricanes in the first round of the\n2023 playoffs\n.\nAfter an inconsistent start to the\n2023\u201324 season\n, head coach Lane Lambert was fired on January 20, 2024, and\nPatrick Roy\nwas hired as his replacement.\n[\n179\n]\n[\n180\n]\nThe Islanders finished in third place in the Metropolitan Division and lost to the Carolina Hurricanes in the first round of the\n2024 playoffs\n.\nAfter a disappointing\n2024\u201325 season\nwhere the team finished 35\u201335\u201312 and missing the playoffs by nine points, the Islanders announced on April 22, 2025, that they would not be renewing Lamoriello's contract, effectively ending his time as general manager and president of hockey operations.\n[\n181\n]\nDespite having only the 10th-best odds, the Islanders won the\n2025 NHL draft lottery\nacquiring the right select first overall for the first time since 2009.\n[\n182\n]\nIn the off-season,\nMathieu Darche\nreplace Lamoriello as general manager.\n[\n183\n]\nTeam identity\n[\nedit\n]\nLogo\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders' first logo, used from 1972 to 1995; a similar logo with a slight difference in colors was used from 1997 to 2010.\nThe club's current wordmark logo.\nAdvertising executive John Alogna created the original Islanders logo, a circle with the letters \"NY\" over a map of the\nNassau\nand\nSuffolk\ncounties. The lower part of the Y is made to resemble a hockey stick, with three orange stripes near the bottom of the shaft and a puck to the right of the stick blade. At the bottom of the logo, the name of the team is written so that the tip of the \"I\" ends in a point aimed at\nUniondale\n, the location of Nassau Coliseum.\nBefore the\n1995\u201396 season\n, the Islanders attempted to update their look by introducing a new logo depicting a fisherman holding a hockey stick. The new logo was a marketing disaster; the reaction among the fanbase was so negative that management announced it would revert to the original logo as soon as league rules allowed them to do so. Many found that the logo bore a strong resemblance to the\nGorton's fisherman\n; indeed,\nNew York Rangers\nfans taunted the Islanders with chants of \"We want\nfishsticks\n!\" long after the logo was discarded.\n[\n184\n]\nThe traditional logo was phased back in over the next two seasons, starting as an\nalternate jersey\nlogo in\n1996\u201397\nbefore fully replacing the fisherman in\n1997\u201398\n. The only change to the classic logo at this time was its colors; as the team had replaced its original royal blue with navy, the logo was recolored to match.\nThe short-lived \"Fisherman\" logo, used from 1995 to 1997\nBeginning in\n2008\u201309\n, the Islanders introduced another modification to their original logo for their new third jersey. The \"new\" logo, once again in royal blue, now features four orange stripes on the hockey stick instead of three, representing the four consecutive Stanley Cup titles won by the team in the 1980s. This became the team's full-time logo in 2010.\nFor their\n2014 Stadium Series\nspecial jerseys, the Islanders used a simplified jersey logo with just the \"NY\" from their regular logo. Versions of that have since appeared on third jersey designs.\nJerseys\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders debuted in 1972 with traditional-style jerseys: one was white with orange and royal blue stripes near the waistline and on the sleeves, the other was royal blue with white and orange stripes. The design remained largely the same, with only minor tweaks through the\n1994\u201395 season\n.\nPrior to the\n1995\u201396 season\n, team executives decided to change the jersey. The fisherman logo replaced the \"NY\" circular design, incorporating navy blue and a brighter orange, and introducing teal and gray shades. The team was seeking increased merchandise revenues, with the outward justification of connecting the team more overtly to Long Island. The jersey included a lighthouse shoulder patch, a reference to the\nMontauk Lighthouse\n, and featured uneven stripes resembling an ocean wave near the waistline, on the sleeves, and across the shoulders. All of the numbering and lettering on the jerseys also followed the wave pattern.\n[\n185\n]\nLate in the season, the team eliminated the fisherman logo, but league rules forbade them from switching jersey designs for the\n1996\u201397 season\non only a few months' notice. Instead, they debuted their first\nthird (and fourth) jerseys\n, which were identical to the home and road jerseys worn by the team, except the circular \"NY\" crest, now colored in the navy blue and bright orange shades to match, replaced the fisherman logo. The team wore these jerseys in approximately 15 games during that season and adopted them permanently in the\n1997\u201398 season\n.\nThe shoulder logo used on Islanders jerseys from 1998 through 2010\nPrior to the\n1998\u201399 season\n, the team's jerseys reverted to a traditional design but kept the navy blue and bright orange shades from the jerseys used the previous three seasons. They added a shoulder patch of four bars, alternating in color, to represent the Islanders' four Stanley Cup championships. A predominantly orange third jersey was introduced in\n2002\u201303\n, featuring navy blue yokes and sides that formed sharp points on the sleeves and body. The team wore this jersey through the\n2006\u201307 season\n.\nFor the\n2007\u201308 season\n, the Islanders redesigned their uniforms as all NHL teams changed over to the\nReebok Edge\nsystem. These jerseys resembled the prior design but included uniform numbers on the right chest above the logo. The name plates were also in two colored format: white on orange on the navy blue home jersey and navy blue on orange on the white road jersey. The sleeves on both jerseys were orange, with a wide navy stripe above a thin white stripe at the elbow. The jerseys had a thin stripe tracing around the shoulders, and featured \"retro\" laces at the neck.\nA royal blue throwback design was introduced the following season as a third jersey. Before the\n2010\u201311 season\n, the Islanders made this throwback design their new home jersey. A corresponding new white road jersey was unveiled during the Islanders'\ndraft\nparty at Nassau Coliseum.\n[\n186\n]\nFor the following season, they unveiled an alternate jersey in black with grey on the shoulder yoke. The front of the jersey bore the team name above the player's number in orange with blue and white trim. The Islanders crest was placed on the shoulder yoke. Diagonal side panels, blue trimmed in orange and gray, combined with similar panels on the black pants to form a diamond shape on the sides of each player. These were only used sparing for two seasons, as they proved unpopular.\nDuring the\n2014 Stadium Series\n, the Islanders wore a special edition jersey. The front side featured the \"NY\" from the primary logo in a special chrome treatment, while the back side featured a white nameplate with blue letters for player names, and bigger numbers in white trimmed in orange for visibility purposes. The sleeve numbers were also angled diagonally. The primary Islanders logo would be placed on the left shoulder within the white yoke. This jersey was promoted to an alternate third jersey in the\n2014\u201315 season\n, replacing the black third jersey. During that season, on February 3, 2015, the team wore an updated version of the fisherman jersey for warmups before their game against the\nFlorida Panthers\n.\n[\n187\n]\n[\n188\n]\nThe Islanders retired the Stadium Series third jersey after only one season, replacing it with a new black alternate that was unveiled to coincide with the team's move to Brooklyn. Unlike the previous black alternate, this version featured little blue and orange at all (these colors appear only on the rear collar), while the \"NY\" insignia that was carried over from the Stadium Series jersey was stripped of its chrome accents. The four narrow white stripes on the sleeves symbolize the franchise's four Stanley Cup wins.\nWhen the NHL switched to\nAdidas\nas its uniform provider in 2017, the Islanders kept their primary jerseys mostly intact except for the restoration of the blue trim in the primary logo on the road jersey. As with all NHL teams, the Islanders only wore two jerseys for the 2017\u201318 season, thus retiring the all-black third jerseys.\nThe Islanders released a new blue third jersey for the 2018\u201319 season, featuring an updated \"NY\" insignia (shorter \"Y-stick\" with four orange stripes on the blade), white shoulder yoke (reminiscent of the 2014 Stadium Series alternates), the map of Long Island on the collar, and orange numbers that call back to the jerseys used during the team's inaugural season.\n[\n189\n]\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the Islanders released a special \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform. The uniform resembled their current home jerseys, but used the navy blue and bright orange scheme worn from 1995 to 2010.\n[\n190\n]\nA second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was released in the 2022\u201323 season, using the \"Fisherman\" uniform from 1995 to 1997 but with less teal elements and diagonal orange striping.\n[\n191\n]\nDuring the\n2024 Stadium Series\n, the Islanders wore navy blue jerseys with a thick orange middle stripe. \"ISLES\" in navy blue letters was added within the orange stripe, as are the navy blue numbers.\n[\n192\n]\nThe Islanders reverted to wearing only their primary jerseys after\nFanatics\ntook over as the NHL uniform provider in 2024, even though it kept most aspects of Adidas' template and retained the use of third jerseys.\nMascot and Ice Girls\n[\nedit\n]\nIce Girls at a community event in 2013\nThe Islanders' team mascot is named \"\nSparky the Dragon\n\", who served at one point as cross-promotion with the\nArena Football League\n's\nNew York Dragons\nteam, who also played their home games at Nassau Coliseum. In the mid-1990s, the Islanders had a mascot named \"Nyisles\" whose body style went from round to human-shaped, and facial features vaguely resembled the logo fisherman, excluding its red hair and beard. Nyisles was discontinued toward the end of the\n1997\u201398 season\nwhen the team distributed \"Who kidnapped Nyisles?\" flyers implying the reason for his disappearance was because of another NHL mascot, ultimately revealed to be\nToronto Maple Leafs\nmascot\nCarlton the Bear\n. Nyisles returned as the secondary mascot of the club with a brand new look in December 2022 to coincide with the return of the Fisherman logo on the team's reverse retro uniforms.\n[\n193\n]\nFrom the 2001\u201302 season to the 2014\u201315 season, the Islanders also had an ice crew named the \"Ice Girls\", made up of only women who skated onto the ice during television breaks to clean up the snow that piled up during the game. The Ice Girls were also used for promotional purposes during games and at community events. Starting in the 2015\u201316 season, a co-ed ice crew would replace the Ice Girls.\nSeason-by-season record\n[\nedit\n]\nThis is only a partial list of the last five seasons.

The Islanders compete in the\nNational Hockey League\n(NHL) as a member of the\nMetropolitan Division\nin the\nEastern Conference\n. The team plays its home games at\nUBS Arena\n. The Islanders are one of three NHL franchises in the\nNew York metropolitan area\n, along with the\nNew Jersey Devils\nand\nNew York Rangers\n, and their fanbase resides primarily on\nLong Island\n.\nThe team was founded in\n1972\nas part of the NHL's maneuvers to keep a team from rival league\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) out of the newly built\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nin suburban\nUniondale, New York\n. After two years of building up the team's roster, they found almost instant success by securing 14 straight playoff berths starting with their third season. The Islanders won four consecutive\nStanley Cup\nchampionships between\n1980\nand\n1983\n, the eighth of nine\ndynasties\nrecognized by the NHL in its history. Their 19 consecutive playoff series wins between 1980 and 1984 is a feat that remains unparalleled in the history of professional sports. They are the last team in any major professional North American sport to win four consecutive championships, and to date the last NHL team to achieve a\nthree-peat\n.\nFollowing the team's dynasty era, the franchise ran into problems with money, ownership and management, an aging arena, and low attendance. Their woes were reflected on the ice, as the team has not won a division title since\n1987\u201388\n, and went 22 seasons without winning a playoff series prior to the\n2016 playoffs\n. After years of failed attempts to rebuild or replace Nassau Coliseum in suburban Long Island, the Islanders relocated to\nBarclays Center\nin Brooklyn following the\n2014\u201315 season\n.\n[\n4\n]\nIn the\n2018\u201319\nand\n2019\u201320\nseasons, the Islanders split their home games between Barclays Center and Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders played all their home games in the\n2020\u201321 season\nat Nassau Coliseum. Their\nnew arena\nnear\nBelmont Park\nwas opened in 2021.\nTen former members of the Islanders have been inducted into the\nHockey Hall of Fame\n, seven of whom\u2014\nMike Bossy\n,\nClark Gillies\n,\nDenis Potvin\n,\nBilly Smith\n,\nBryan Trottier\n, coach\nAl Arbour\n, and general manager\nBill Torrey\n\u2014were members of all four Cup-winning teams. Post-dynasty players\nPat LaFontaine\n,\nRoberto Luongo\nand\nPierre Turgeon\nwere also inducted.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe NHL heads to Long Island (1972\u20131974)\n[\nedit\n]\nIn fall 1972, the emerging\nWorld Hockey Association\n(WHA) planned to place its New York team, the\nNew York Raiders\n, in\nNassau County\n's brand-new\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\n.\n[\n5\n]\nCounty officials did not consider the WHA a major league and wanted to keep the Raiders out.\n[\n6\n]\nWilliam Shea\n, who had helped bring\nMajor League Baseball\n's\nNew York Mets\nto the area a decade earlier, was enlisted to bring an NHL team to Long Island. Although Shea had previously worked with upstart rival leagues including the aborted\nContinental League\n, the\nAmerican Football League\nand the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n, his ultimate goal in these efforts had always been to try to persuade the established leagues to grant second franchises to New York as had been the case with the Mets (and also with the\nNew York Jets\nand\nNew York Nets\n, as a result of those teams' leagues merging with their established rivals).\nWilliam Shea\nplayed a major role in bringing a hockey team to Long Island.\nIn contrast, Shea decided there was no need to work with the WHA since unlike the initial results of his previous approaches to established leagues in the other major sports, Shea immediately found NHL president\nClarence Campbell\nto be receptive to adding a second team in New York. Nevertheless, the Islanders' bid faced opposition from the\nNew York Rangers\n, who did not want additional competition in the New York area.\n[\n7\n]\nEventually, Campbell and Shea persuaded the Rangers' owners,\nMadison Square Garden\n, to reconsider. Rangers' president\nBill Jennings\nweighed pros and cons. Another local NHL team would be compelled to compensate the Rangers for sharing the New York area. On the other hand, a WHA team would owe the Rangers nothing unless it was included in a potential NHL\u2013WHA merger, a prospect to which both Campbell and Jennings were adamantly opposed. Finally, consenting to the establishment of an NHL franchise in suburban Nassau County would help to ensure the vast majority of the Rangers' fanbase within New York City proper would continue to support the older franchise, and reduced the prospect of a rival league eventually establishing a team and fanbase there. Perhaps remembering the crucial role the Jets had played in ensuring the success of the AFL just a few years earlier as a challenger of the\nNational Football League\n, Jennings decided to help bring a new NHL team to the New York metropolitan area.\n[\n8\n]\nDespite expanding to 14 teams just two years prior, the NHL awarded a\nLong Island\n-based franchise to clothing manufacturer\nRoy Boe\n, owner of the\nAmerican Basketball Association\n's\nNew York Nets\n, on November 8, 1971.\n[\n8\n]\nThe terms included $6\u00a0million ($45.1\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) franchise fee plus a $5\u00a0million ($37.59\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) territorial fee to the Rangers.\n[\n10\n]\nAn expansion franchise was also given to\nAtlanta\n(the\nFlames\n) to keep the schedule balanced and to prevent the WHA from entering the growing market at the newly built\nOmni Coliseum\n.\n[\n7\n]\nThe New York Islanders name was unveiled by the franchise on February 15, 1972, at a\npress conference\nheld across the street from\nRoosevelt Raceway\nat a restaurant owned by\nBurt Bacharach\n.\n[\n11\n]\nMany expected it to use the \"\nLong Island Ducks\n\", after the\nEastern Hockey League\nteam that played from 1959 to 1973.\n[\n12\n]\nThe team was soon nicknamed the \"Isles\" by the local newspapers. The Islanders' arrival effectively doomed the Raiders, who played in Madison Square Garden under difficult lease terms and were forced to move to\nCherry Hill, New Jersey\nin the middle of their second season.\n[\n6\n]\nFormer\nCalifornia Golden Seals\nexecutive vice president\nBill Torrey\nwas named as the team's general manager at the same press conference as the franchise's name unveiling.\n[\n11\n]\nThe Islanders secured veteran forward\nEd Westfall\n, defenseman\nGerry Hart\n, and goaltender\nBilly Smith\nin the\n1972 expansion draft\n, along with\njunior ice hockey\nstars\nBilly Harris\n,\nLorne Henning\n, and\nBobby Nystrom\nin the\n1972 amateur draft\n.\n[\n13\n]\nSoon after the draft,\nPhil Goyette\nwas named as the team's first head coach, however he was fired halfway through the season and replaced with\nEarl Ingarfield\nand assistant coach\nAut Erickson\n.\n[\n14\n]\nUnlike most other expansion teams' general managers, Torrey made few trades for veteran players in the early years, as he was committed to building the team through the draft. Torrey stated, \"I told the owners that we're not going to beat this team next door by taking the castoffs from others teams. We'd have to develop our own stars.\"\n[\n13\n]\nBefore the season began, Westfall was named the team's first captain.\n[\n15\n]\n[\n16\n]\nBy September 1972, the Islanders were waiting for the Nassau Coliseum to be completed as well as their practice facility \"The Royal Ice Rink\" in\nKings Park\n. The team was forced to practice as late as October 6, the day before their first game, at the Rangers practice rink in\nNew Hyde Park\n.\n[\n17\n]\nThe Islanders' first win came on October 12, 1972, in a 3\u20132 game against the\nLos Angeles Kings\n.\n[\n14\n]\nIn the team's first season, young players such as Smith, Nystrom, and Henning (all of whom would be part of the Islanders dynasty of the early 1980s) were given chances to prove themselves in the NHL. The young and inexperienced expansion team, however, posted a record of 12\u201360\u20136, setting an NHL record for most losses and worst overall record in a season.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n18\n]\nA highlight occurred on January 18, 1973, when they defeated the defending\nStanley Cup\nchampion\nBoston Bruins\n9\u20137.\n[\n14\n]\nFinishing last in the standings that season, they received the right to select first in the\n1973 draft\n.\n[\n18\n]\nOff the ice, the Islanders struggled financially, a situation that was exacerbated by the then-unprecedented $11 million in franchise and territorial fees.\nMontreal Canadiens\n' general manager\nSam Pollock\nwas keen to acquire the Islanders' pick so he could draft French Canadian junior star defenseman\nDenis Potvin\n, who had been touted as \"the next\nBobby Orr\n\" when he was 14 years old. Pollock made several lucrative trade offers including cash to the Islanders, but Torrey turned the Canadiens down and selected Potvin with the first overall pick.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n19\n]\nDuring the off-season, Torrey convinced former\nSt. Louis Blues\ncoach\nAl Arbour\nto come coach the Islanders.\n[\n8\n]\nEven with Arbour as the team's head coach and Potvin, who won the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\nas NHL Rookie of the Year, the team again finished last in the\nEast Division\nduring the\n1973\u201374 season\n, but allowed 100 fewer goals than the previous season. The season included their first win against the Rangers, on October 27, 1973,\n[\n5\n]\nwhich also happened to be the game where Potvin scored his first NHL goal. Although they failed to make the playoffs, their 56 points represented a 26-point improvement from the previous season.\n[\n8\n]\nAscendancy and playoff inability (1974\u20131979)\n[\nedit\n]\nDenis Potvin\nled the Islanders to playoff success in the 1970s and 1980s.\nWith the 4th and 22nd picks in the\n1974 draft\n, the Islanders added young forwards\nClark Gillies\nand\nBryan Trottier\nto continue Torrey's building plan.\n[\n20\n]\nIn the\n1974\u201375 season\n, the Islanders made one of the biggest turnarounds in NHL history. Led by Potvin, forwards Westfall, Harris, Nystrom, Gillies, and goaltenders Smith and\nGlenn \"Chico\" Resch\n, the team earned 88 points, 32 more than the previous season and two more than their first two seasons combined, earning their first playoff berth. They defeated the rival\nNew York Rangers\nin a best-of-3 first-round series as\nJ. P. Parise\nscored just 11 seconds into overtime of the third game.\n[\n8\n]\nIn the next round, down three games to none in a best-of-seven series against the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, the Islanders rallied to win the next four and take the series-winning game 7 on a late third-period goal by Westfall. Only four other major North American professional sports teams have accomplished this feat (the\n1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs\n,\n2004 Boston Red Sox\n, the\n2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers\n, and the\n2013\u201314 Los Angeles Kings\n).\n[\n21\n]\nThey were close but not as lucky in the following round, rallying from another 3\u20130 deficit to force a seventh game against the defending\nStanley Cup\nchampion\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nbefore the Flyers took the decisive seventh game at home and went on to win the Cup again.\n[\n8\n]\nDespite a disappointing playoff finish, Arbour remained complimentary of the team's attitude and maturity, saying \"If I called a practice next week, every one of them would show up.\"\n[\n22\n]\nThe Islanders continued their climb up the standings in\n1975\u201376\n, earning 101 points and the fifth-best record in the league.\n[\n23\n]\nIt was the first 100-point season in Islanders history, in only their fourth year of existence.\n[\n24\n]\nRookie center Trottier finished the season with 95 points and won the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n; his points and assists (63) totals set a new league record for most in each category by a rookie.\n[\n25\n]\nIt would be the first of four consecutive 100-point seasons, including the first two division titles in franchise history.\n[\n24\n]\n[\n26\n]\nDespite the emergence of young star players and regular season success between 1976 and 1979 the Islanders suffered a series of playoff disappointments. In\n1976\nand\n1977 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, the Islanders were knocked out in the semifinals by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the\nMontreal Canadiens\n.\n[\n27\n]\nThe Canadiens posted a 24\u20133 record in the playoffs during those two seasons with all three losses coming at the hands of the Islanders.\n[\n28\n]\nMike Bossy\nwas selected with the 15th overall pick in\n1977\nand became the third Islander to win the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n.\nIn the\n1977 draft\n, Torrey had the 15th overall pick and was deciding between forwards\nMike Bossy\nand\nDwight Foster\n. Bossy was known as an emerging scorer who lacked physicality. Foster was known as a solid\nchecker\nwith marginal offensive ability (despite having led the\nOntario Hockey League\nin scoring). Arbour persuaded Torrey to pick Bossy, arguing it was easier to teach a scorer how to check.\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nIn the\n1977\u201378 season\n, Bossy became the third Islander to win the Calder Trophy, and scored 53 goals that season, a rookie record at the time.\n[\n8\n]\nThe team earned their first Patrick Division and Campbell Conference championships.\n[\n14\n]\nSix players finished the season with 30 goals scored or more, with five of them Islanders draft picks, showing the success of the draft building process.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n31\n]\nThe season ended with a familiar result in the\nplayoffs\n, as the team lost in overtime in game 7 of the quarterfinals against the\nToronto Maple Leafs\n.\n[\n29\n]\nIn\n1978\u201379\n, the team finished with the best record in the NHL, clinching it with three goals in the third period of the season's final game against the Rangers. Trottier won the\nHart Memorial Trophy\nas league MVP and captured the\nArt Ross Trophy\nfor the most points, while sophomore Bossy scored 69 goals, which also led the league. Despite their regular season dominance, the Islanders exited the playoffs with another upset playoff loss, this time to the Rangers in the semifinals. As the team was leaving\nMadison Square Garden\nfollowing their game 6 elimination, Rangers fans rocked and threw objects at the team's bus. Hockey professionals and journalists generally questioned whether the Islanders were capable of winning the important games needed to win a Stanley Cup championship. Islander players would cite fear of repeating the pain of this loss as spurring their later success. After transferring the captaincy to Gillies the season before, Westfall retired and shortly thereafter became a color commentator on the team's telecasts.\nOff the ice, the Islanders were on shaky ground. Boe was losing money on both his franchises, even as the Islanders quickly surged to NHL prominence and the Nets became an ABA power. The Islanders were still far behind on the $10\u00a0million they had paid in startup costs, and the expansion and territorial fees associated with moving the Nets to the\nNational Basketball Association\nthrew Boe's finances into a tailspin. Eventually, Boe was forced to sell both his teams. He readily found a buyer for the Nets, but had less luck finding one for the Islanders. Torrey orchestrated a sale to one of the team's limited partners,\nJohn Pickett\n. In return, Pickett promoted Torrey to team president, though Torrey had already been operating head of the franchise before then. Soon after purchasing the team, Pickett signed a very lucrative\ncable television\ncontract with the fledgling\nSportsChannel\nnetwork as their owner,\nCharles Dolan\n, thought the up-and-coming Islanders would be a perfect centerpiece for his new network. Dolan gave Pickett a long-term guaranteed contract intended not only to keep the team on Long Island, but give area governments an incentive to renew his cable contracts. The Islanders have remained on the network, now known as\nMSG Sportsnet\n, for over four decades.\nThe Dynasty (1979\u20131983)\n[\nedit\n]\nAfter the Islanders' regular season dominance and playoff disappointment in 1979, Arbour decided that he would no longer concern himself too greatly with his team's finish in the regular season. Instead, he focused his team's energy on how they would perform in the playoffs. In\n1980\n, the Islanders dropped below the 100-point mark for the first time in five years, earning only 91 points. However, they finally broke through and won the\nStanley Cup\n.\nBefore the\n1980\nplayoffs, the Islanders acquired\nButch Goring\nfrom the\nLos Angeles Kings\n. Goring's arrival was often called the \"final piece of the puzzle.\"\nBefore the playoffs, Torrey made the difficult decision to trade longtime and popular veterans Billy Harris and defenseman\nDave Lewis\nto the\nLos Angeles Kings\nfor second line center\nButch Goring\n. Goring's arrival is often called the \"final piece of the puzzle\",\n[\n32\n]\na strong two-way player, his presence on the second line ensured that opponents would no longer be able to focus their defensive efforts on the Islanders' first line of Bossy, Trottier and\nClark Gillies\n. Contributions from new teammates, such as wingers\nDuane Sutter\nand\nAnders Kallur\nand\nstay-at-home defensemen\nDave Langevin\n,\nGord Lane\n, and\nKen Morrow\n(the latter fresh off a gold medal win at the\n1980 Olympics\n), also figured prominently in the Islanders' playoff success.\nIn the playoffs, the Islanders defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3\u20131 in the preliminary round, then beat the Boston Bruins 4\u20131 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, the Islanders faced the\nBuffalo Sabres\n, who had finished second overall in the NHL standings. The Islanders won the first two games in Buffalo, including a 2\u20131 victory in game two on\nBob Nystrom\n's goal in double overtime. They went on to win the series in six games and reach the finals for the first time in franchise history, where they would face the NHL's regular season champions, the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, who had gone undefeated for 35 straight games (25\u20130\u201310) during the regular season. In game one in\nPhiladelphia\n, the Islanders won 4\u20133 on\nDenis Potvin\n's power-play goal in overtime. Leading the series 3\u20132, they went home to Long Island for game six. In that game the Islanders blew a 4\u20132 lead in the third period but Nystrom continued his overtime heroics, scoring at 7:11 of the extra frame, on assists by John Tonelli and Lorne Henning, to bring Long Island its first Stanley Cup championship. This was the most recent Stanley Cup-clinching game won in overtime by the home team until the Los Angeles Kings did it in 2014. It was also the Islanders' sixth overtime victory of the playoffs. Bryan Trottier won the\nConn Smythe Trophy\nas the most valuable player in the playoffs. Torrey's strategy of building through the draft turned out very well; nearly all of the major contributors on the 1980 champions were home-grown Islanders or had spent most of their NHL careers in the Islanders organization. The Islanders were the first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup with Europeans (\nStefan Persson\nand Kallur) on its roster.\n[\n33\n]\nThe Islanders dominated the next two seasons. Bossy scored\n50 goals in 50 games\nin\n1981\nand the Islanders lost only three playoff games en route to defeating the\nMinnesota North Stars\nin five games to win the Stanley Cup. Goring won the Conn Smythe Trophy. During their semifinals sweep of the Rangers, Islander fans began taunting the Rangers with a chant of \"\n1940!\n\"\u00a0\u2013 referring to the Rangers' last Stanley Cup win in\n1940\n(the Rangers would not win the cup again until\n1994\n). Fans in other NHL cities soon picked up the chant.\n[\n34\n]\nThese four banners hung in\nNassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum\nand represent the four\nStanley Cup\nchampionships the Islanders won from 1980 through 1983.\nIn\n1981\u201382\n, the Islanders won a then-record 15 straight games en route to a franchise-record 118 points, while\nMike Bossy\nset a scoring record for right-wingers with 147 points in an 80-game schedule. The Islanders finished with the most points in the league (118), yet once in the playoffs against the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nthey found themselves down late in the third period of deciding game 5 before\nJohn Tonelli\nscored both the tying goal and the overtime winner. After defeating the Rangers in six games they swept both the\nQuebec Nordiques\nand the\nVancouver Canucks\nin the first-ever coast-to-coast\nStanley Cup Finals\nfor their third straight championship. During that series Bossy, upended by a check from\nTiger Williams\nand falling parallel to the ice, managed to hook the puck with his stick and score. Bossy netted the Stanley Cup-winning goal and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nThe next year, although the Islanders had won the Stanley Cup three straight times, more attention was being paid to the upstart\nEdmonton Oilers\n, whose young superstar\nWayne Gretzky\nhad just shattered existing scoring records.\n[\n35\n]\nIn\n1982\u201383\nthe Oilers had a better regular season, but the Islanders swept them in the\nStanley Cup Finals\nto win their fourth straight championship.\nBilly Smith\nwas named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner after shutting down the Oilers' vaunted scoring machine. Gretzky failed to score a goal during the series.\n[\n36\n]\nDuane and\nBrent Sutter\nscored seven and five points respectively in the first three games, while Bossy again scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in game four. After that game, the Oilers players walked past the Islanders' dressing room and were surprised to see the champions exhausted. Oilers players such as Gretzky and\nMark Messier\nsaid that they realized at that moment how much it would actually take to win the Stanley Cup.\n[\n36\n]\n[\n37\n]\nPost-dynasty and the Easter Epic (1983\u20131991)\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders finished the\n1983\u201384 regular season\ntied atop the Prince of Wales Conference while successfully defending their Patrick Division title. The \"Drive for Five\" got off to a tense start. Late in the deciding game of their first-round series against the Rangers,\nDon Maloney\ntied the game with a controversial goal as the Islanders believed Maloney's stick was too high. They ultimately eliminated the Rangers for the fourth consecutive year. The team then defeated the\nWashington Capitals\nin five games and the\nMontreal Canadiens\nin six to set up a finals rematch with the Oilers. The series featured rookie\nPat LaFontaine\nscoring two third-period goals in 38 seconds. This time, the Oilers dethroned the Islanders to win the first of what would be five Stanley Cup victories in seven years. For the\n1984 playoffs\n, the NHL changed the home and away schedule for the finals, which provided the Islanders home-ice advantage in the series based on Wales Conference teams collectively having a winning record in regular season games versus Campbell Conference opponents,\n[\n38\n]\ndespite finishing lower than them in the overall standings. The new format had them play three straight games in Edmonton, where the Oilers managed to lock up the series, after the teams had split the first two games in New York. Bossy cited the team's hard time winning an away game as their downfall in the series.\n[\n39\n]\nThe Oilers also ended the Islanders' 19-series playoff winning streak. It remains the longest streak in the history of professional sports (one more than the 1959\u20131967 streak by the\nBoston Celtics\nof the NBA). Unlike the 1976\u20131979 Montreal Canadiens, who needed to win three series in the 1976 and 1977 playoffs under the playoff format in place at that time, the Islanders had to win four series in each of their Stanley Cup seasons.\nThe Islanders remained competitive for the rest of the decade, even as some of the stars from the Cup teams departed. As the decade wore on, Pickett began to keep the money from the team's cable deal rather than reinvest it in the team as he had done in years past. Although it did not become clear immediately, the lack of funds limited Torrey's ability to replace all of the departing talent. In the\n1984\u201385 NHL season\n, the Islanders slipped to third in their division, followed by similar results in the\n1985\u201386\nand\n1986\u201387\nseasons. They began facing stiff competition from division rivals, the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\n, who eliminated the Islanders in the division finals in 1985 and 1987, and the Capitals, who swept the Islanders' 1986 first-round series, the team's first exit without winning a playoff round since 1978.\nKelly Hrudey\n(pictured in 2006) saved 73 of 75 shots in the \"\nEaster Epic\n\" for the Islanders, who came out victorious after four periods of overtime play.\nIn 1986, Nystrom retired due to a serious injury\n[\n40\n]\nand\nClark Gillies\nwas picked up on waivers by the\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\n[\n41\n]\nArbour retired as coach following the\n1985\u201386 season\nand was replaced by longtime junior hockey coach\nTerry Simpson\n.\n[\n42\n]\nDuring the first round of the\n1987 playoffs\nagainst the Capitals, the Islanders had fallen behind in the series three games to one but were not eliminated due to a playoff format change from a best-of-5 series to a best-of-7.\n[\n43\n]\nThe Islanders evened the series, which set the stage for one of the most famous games in NHL history: the \"\nEaster Epic\n\".\nKelly Hrudey\nstopped 73 shots on goal while Pat LaFontaine scored at 8:47 of the fourth overtime\u2014and at 1:56\u00a0a.m. on\nEaster Sunday\nmorning. The win came even though the Islanders had been outshot 75\u201352.\n[\n44\n]\n[\n45\n]\n[\n46\n]\nThey were eliminated in the division finals in seven games by the Flyers.\n[\n47\n]\nChronic back pain forced\nMike Bossy\nto retire after the season.\n[\n48\n]\nThe\nfollowing season\n, the Islanders captured another division title,\n[\n49\n]\nbut were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the upstart\nNew Jersey Devils\n.\n[\n50\n]\nPotvin retired after the playoffs, holding records for most career goals (310), assists (742) and points (1052) by a defenseman, though he has since been passed in these categories by\nRay Bourque\nand\nPaul Coffey\n. Around this time, the team's run of good luck in the draft began to run out. Of their four top draft picks from 1987 to 1990, they lost one to a freak knee injury and two others never panned out.\n[\n51\n]\nThe\n1988\u201389 season\nsaw the Islanders win only seven of their first 27 games. Torrey fired Simpson and brought Arbour back. Arbour was unable to turn things around, and the team finished with 61 points, tied with the\nQuebec Nordiques\nfor the worst record in the league. It was their first losing season and the first time missing the playoffs since their second season. Smith, the last remaining original Islanders player, retired after the season to become the team's goaltending coach. Not long after the end of the season, Pickett moved to Florida and turned day-to-day operations over to a committee of four Long Island entrepreneurs: Ralph Palleschi, Bob Rosenthal,\nStephen Walsh\n, and\nPaul Greenwood\n. In return, they each bought a 2.5% interest in the team.\n[\n51\n]\nIn the\nnext season\n, the Islanders rebounded to get back into the playoffs, but fell to the Rangers in five games of the opening round. The team bought out the remaining years of\nBryan Trottier\n's contract, sending him off with a team record of games played. The\n1990\u201391 season\nhad the team finish well out of the playoffs after winning only 25 games.\nNew faces and the 1993 run (1991\u20131995)\n[\nedit\n]\nLaFontaine was frustrated with the team's lack of success and the progress of his contract negotiations, and held out rather than report to camp before\n1991\u201392\n. In response to the holdout, Torrey engineered a rebuilding project with two blockbuster trades on October 25, 1991. He dealt LaFontaine,\nRandy Wood\nand\nRandy Hillier\n(along with future considerations) to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin return for\nPierre Turgeon\n,\nBenoit Hogue\n,\nUwe Krupp\nand\nDave McLlwain\n. He also sent longtime captain\nBrent Sutter\nand\nBrad Lauer\nto the\nChicago Blackhawks\nfor\nSteve Thomas\nand\nAdam Creighton\n. With these additions and a talented core of players such as\nDerek King\n,\nRay Ferraro\n, and\nPatrick Flatley\n, along with incoming\nSoviet\nplayers\nVladimir Malakhov\nand\nDarius Kasparaitis\n, the Islanders had a new foundation in the early 1990s. The management committee, however, was not nearly as patient as Boe and Pickett had been, and forced Torrey to resign after the Islanders missed the playoffs again that season. Assistant general manager\nDon Maloney\nwas hired in Torrey's place,\n[\n51\n]\nwhile Torrey quickly resurfaced with the expansion\nFlorida Panthers\n.\nIn Maloney's first year,\n1992\u201393\n, the Islanders rebounded to make the playoffs, in the process surpassing the 80-point mark for the first time in five years. The LaFontaine-Turgeon trade proved successful for both the Islanders and Sabres, as both players hit career highs in points and Turgeon won the\nLady Byng Trophy\n.\nRay Ferraro emerged as a playoff hero, scoring a pair of overtime winners in the first-round series against the Capitals. Instead of celebrating after winning game 6 at Nassau Coliseum, however, the Islanders were both irate and despondent. Only seconds after Turgeon, the team's star center and leading scorer, scored an insurance goal in the series-clinching game,\nDale Hunter\nviolently checked him from behind. Turgeon was believed to be out for the entire second round, if not longer, with a separated shoulder. He returned only for spot power-play duty in the last game of the second round. Hunter received a 21-game suspension, at the time the longest for on-ice misconduct in modern NHL history.\nThe Islanders' next opponent, the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, were twice-defending Stanley Cup champions and full of stars such as\nMario Lemieux\n,\nJaromir Jagr\n, and\nRon Francis\n. The Penguins had roared through the regular season with 119 points, as well as recording a record 17 consecutive wins towards the end of the season, and were overwhelmingly favored to win a third straight championship. Jim Smith of\nNewsday\npredicted that with Turgeon on the sidelines, the Penguins would sweep the Islanders out of the playoffs, however on the strength of outstanding goaltending from\nGlenn Healy\nand contributions from all four lines, the Islanders achieved a huge upset when\nDavid Volek\nscored at 5:16 of overtime of the deciding seventh game.\nNewsday'\ns front page the day following the win was a picture of Healy with a headline reading, \"It's a Miracle!\" This was the last playoff series won by the Islanders for 23 years, until the 2015\u201316 season. Turgeon returned to the Islanders' top line for the conference finals against the\nMontreal Canadiens\n, though he was not in peak form as he had not fully recovered. The Islanders bowed out of the playoffs after a hard-fought five games, two of which went to overtime. After beating the Islanders, the Canadiens went on to win the Cup.\nMaloney had avoided making many personnel changes his first year, but on the eve of the\n1993 expansion draft\nhe traded backup goaltender\nMark Fitzpatrick\nto the\nQuebec Nordiques\nfor\nRon Hextall\n. The clubs also exchanged first-round picks in the deal. Able to protect only one netminder in the expansion draft, the Islanders left Healy exposed. He was claimed by the\nMighty Ducks of Anaheim\n, then was claimed by the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nin Phase II of the draft the next day, and finally had his rights traded to the Rangers, where he became the backup.\nThe Islanders barely squeezed past the Panthers to make the 1994 playoffs before being swept in a lopsided opening series by the first-place Rangers, who went on to win the Cup. It would be the Islanders' last playoff appearance until\n2002\n. Arbour retired for good as coach and was succeeded by longtime assistant\nLorne Henning\n. Hextall, who allowed 16 goals in three games, drew most of the criticism for the failed playoff campaign and was shipped to Philadelphia for\nTommy Soderstrom\nin September. In the lockout-shortened 1994\u201395 season, the Islanders not only failed to qualify for the playoffs, they finished ahead of only the third-year\nOttawa Senators\n.\nManagement issues (1995\u20132000)\n[\nedit\n]\nBy the end of the 1994\u201395 season, Maloney was under considerable heat from the press and fan base for his handling of the team. Since taking over in 1992, the only noticeable attempt he made to upgrade the roster was the acquisition of Hextall. Near the end of the failed 1995 campaign, Maloney decided that the core of players he had left alone for three seasons needed to be revamped, leading to a rebuilding project. He traded Turgeon and Malakhov to the\nMontreal Canadiens\nfor\nKirk Muller\nand\nMathieu Schneider\n, while Hogue was sent to\nToronto\nfor young goaltender\nEric Fichaud\n. Additionally, Maloney allowed the team's leading scorer, Ferraro, to depart as an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of the season. Fans' displeasure at Maloney for trading the popular Turgeon was magnified when Muller balked at joining a rebuilding team. He played 45 games for the Islanders before being sent to Toronto as well.\nBefore the\n1995\u201396 season\n, Maloney fired Henning and named\nMike Milbury\nhead coach. The same year, the Islanders' attempt at updating their look resulted in the unveiling of a new team logo of a slicker-clad fisherman holding a hockey stick. Islanders fans disliked it, and rival Rangers' fans mockingly called the Islanders \"\nfishsticks\n\"\u2014mocking how the logo resembled the\nGorton's Fisherman\n. The team reverted to a modified version of the old logo as soon as the league allowed them to do so. (In spite of this, the logo found renewed popularity as a throwback design in the late 2010s and early 2020s, enough so that the team would revive it as their third \"Reverse Retro\" jersey in 2022 and would use an adjusted version of the logo for their AHL team, the\nBridgeport Islanders\n, beginning in 2024.) The year was a disappointment on the ice as well, as the Islanders finished in last place with a record of 22\u201350\u201310. During the season, team management fired Maloney, whom fans blamed for the team's downfall,\n[\n52\n]\nand gave Milbury full control of hockey operations as both a coach and general manager. Milbury went on to resign as head coach during the\nfollowing season\nand elevated assistant\nRick Bowness\nto the position. After another unsuccessful season with little improvement, Milbury took over as coach again during the\n1997\u201398 season\n. The team improved to fourth place in their division but again failed to make the playoffs. Milbury followed by once again stepping down as coach during the\nfollowing season\nwhile retaining his job as general manager.\nDuring the continued playoff drought, instability in the front office mirrored the Islanders' substandard performance on the ice. Pickett sold the team to\nDallas\nbusinessman\nJohn Spano\nin 1996. However, three months after the 1997 closing, Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of the first installment on the cable rights deal. Several Islanders executives tipped off\nNewsday\nthat something was amiss about their new boss.\n[\n53\n]\nIn July,\nNewsday\nexposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required to complete the deal. The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth, and also had two lawsuits pending against him. Within days of the report, Spano was forced to relinquish the team to Pickett. Federal prosecutors turned up evidence that Spano had forged many of the documents used to vouch for his wealth and to promise payment to Pickett, and even appeared to have sent many of the documents from his own office in Dallas. He was sentenced to 71 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. The NHL took additional heat when reports surfaced that the league spent well under $1,000 (depending on the source, the league spent either $525\n[\n53\n]\nor $750\n[\n51\n]\n) to check Spano's background. It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners. The incident and its aftermath were covered in the\nESPN\n30 for 30\ndocumentary,\nBig Shot\n.\n[\n54\n]\nPickett finally found a buyer, a group led by\nHoward Milstein\nand\nPhoenix Coyotes\nco-owner Steven Gluckstern, a deal which almost fell through when\nSpectacor Management Group\n, which managed the Coliseum for Nassau County, tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was safe. Pickett refused, since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in recent seasons. SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders, the NHL, and Nassau County officials.\nInitially, the team made numerous trades and increased their payroll in an effort to assemble a better team. In one transaction, young players\nTodd Bertuzzi\nand\nBryan McCabe\nwere traded for veteran\nTrevor Linden\n. After the Islanders finished 12 points short of the playoffs in the 1997\u201398 season, however, Milstein and Gluckstern decided to run the team on an austere budget in an attempt to make a profit. They also complained about the condition of the Nassau Coliseum and made noises about moving the team elsewhere. They began trading or releasing many popular players to avoid paying their salaries, including star scorer\nZigmund Palffy\n, team captain Linden, former rookie of the year\nBryan Berard\n, and rugged defenseman\nRich Pilon\n. Losing the highly regarded players, the team finished with similar results the next two seasons. Attendance, which had been in a steady decline over the past few years, decreased even further to under 12,000 per game. Around that time, Milstein bid hundreds of millions of dollars in unsuccessful attempts to purchase the\nNational Football League\n's\nWashington Redskins\nand\nCleveland Browns\n.\nNew ownership and a return to the playoffs (2000\u20132006)\n[\nedit\n]\nLet's face it, the Coliseum is a dump, and the team, well, they're losers. It's a real shame. We want to see it change because this is our home. We all deserve better.\n\u2014\nCharles Wang\n[\n55\n]\nIn 2000, Milstein and Gluckstern sold the team to\nComputer Associates\nexecutives\nCharles Wang\nand\nSanjay Kumar\n. The sale cost $187.5\u00a0million ($342.36\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) and gave fans hope for the team to turn its lack of success around.\n[\n55\n]\nThe new owners allowed Milbury to spend money and invest in free agents. His first attempt proved unpopular with fans, as he traded away future star players\nRoberto Luongo\nand\nOlli Jokinen\nto the\nFlorida Panthers\nfor\nOleg Kvasha\nand\nMark Parrish\n. Milbury then further surprised the hockey world when he took\nRick DiPietro\nwith the first selection in the\n2000 draft\n, ahead of consensus picks\nDany Heatley\nand\nMarian Gaborik\n. Reporters and fans were alternately confused and enraged by the moves, which Milbury acknowledged, saying, \"As dangerous as this may be, we think Mad Mike maybe has something going for him.\"\n[\n56\n]\nEstablishing a record of controversial decisions, Milbury held onto the \"Mad Mike\" nickname for years to follow. He remained adamant that his moves were to immediately improve the team, whose poor winning percentage that year was ahead of only the franchise's first season.\n[\n57\n]\nThe team's uninspired play led Milbury to fire head coach and past player\nButch Goring\n. Fans vocalized their dislike of Goring taking the fall rather than Milbury, which was further worsened when Milbury passed on hiring\nTed Nolan\nas Goring's successor; Instead,\nBoston Bruins\nassistant coach\nPeter Laviolette\nwas hired.\n[\n58\n]\nThe Islanders acquired\nAlexei Yashin\n(left) prior to the\n2001\u201302 season\n. Yashin would go on to become the team's captain in later years.\nThree key personnel acquisitions were made prior to the 2001\u201302 season, Laviolette's first.\nAlexei Yashin\nwas acquired from the\nOttawa Senators\nin exchange for forward\nBill Muckalt\n, defenseman\nZdeno Chara\nand the Islanders' second overall pick in the\n2001 draft\n. Next, Islanders prospects\nTim Connolly\nand\nTaylor Pyatt\nwere traded to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin exchange for\nMichael Peca\n, who became the team's captain.\n[\n59\n]\n[\n60\n]\nBy virtue of finishing with the worst record in the previous season,\nDetroit Red Wings\ngoaltender\nChris Osgood\nwas the next addition, taken as the first pick in the September 2001 waiver draft, adding a former Stanley Cup championship goaltender without giving up any players in exchange.\n[\n61\n]\nThe additions proved to be a great help, as the team opened the season with a 9\u20130\u20131\u20131 record, the best in franchise history. They finished the season with new broken records; their 96 points marked the fourth biggest one-year turnaround in the league's history (44 points higher than the previous season), while Osgood's 66 starts surpassed\nRon Hextall\n's previous record of 65.\n[\n22\n]\nDuring the\n2002 Stanley Cup playoffs\n, they were seeded fifth and faced the fourth-seeded\nToronto Maple Leafs\n. The Islanders lost in a very physical first-round series in seven games; the home team won every game of the series. Notably, game 5 featured\nGary Roberts\ncharging Islander defenseman\nKenny Jonsson\n, and\nDarcy Tucker\nsubmarining Peca with a questionable check that tore the Islander captain's\nanterior cruciate ligament\n, sidelining both players for the series' final game. The situation between Tucker and Peca caused a bit of outrage, with speculation that Tucker had intended to injure Peca before the game had begun, which Tucker denied.\n[\n62\n]\nDespite the promise shown in the Toronto playoff series, the Islanders had a slow start to the\n2002\u201303 season\n. They rebounded to make the playoffs, but lost a five-game series in the first round to the top-seeded\nOttawa Senators\n.\n[\n63\n]\nMilbury continued his controversial move-making by firing Laviolette after the season, citing postseason interviews with the players in which they expressed a lack of confidence in the coach.\n[\n64\n]\nHe was replaced with\nSteve Stirling\n, who had previously been coaching the team's top minor league affiliate, the\nBridgeport Sound Tigers\n. In the\nfollowing season\n, the Islanders again lost in the first round of the playoffs, this time to the eventual champion\nTampa Bay Lightning\n.\n[\n65\n]\nFollowing the\n2004\u201305 NHL lockout\n, which eliminated that season of play, the Islanders made several player moves to increase offense for\nfollowing season\n. Peca was traded to the\nEdmonton Oilers\nfor center\nMike York\n, freeing up room under the NHL's new salary cap.\n[\n66\n]\nThe same day, the team signed winger\nMiroslav Satan\nto play alongside Yashin.\n[\n67\n]\nMilbury also worked on remaking the team's defense, adding\nAlexei Zhitnik\n,\nBrad Lukowich\nand\nBrent Sopel\nto replace the departed\nAdrian Aucoin\nand\nRoman Hamrlik\n, who left as free agents, and Jonsson, who left the NHL to play in the\nHockeyAllsvenskan\nin Sweden.\n[\n68\n]\nIn the aftermath, Yashin was named as the team's new captain.\n[\n69\n]\nThe team's inconsistent play led to Stirling's dismissal midway through the season.\n[\n14\n]\nManagement shake-ups and the DiPietro contract (2006\u20132009)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn the day of Stirling's firing, January 11, 2006, Milbury also announced that he would step down as general manager once a successor was found.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n70\n]\nHe served as vice president of Wang's sports properties for one year before resigning in May 2007.\n[\n71\n]\nWang proceeded by hiring\nNeil Smith\nas general manager and\nTed Nolan\nas head coach, following a brief stint by\nBrad Shaw\nas the team's interim head coach.\n[\n72\n]\n[\n73\n]\nSmith, however, was fired after approximately one month and quickly replaced by the team's backup goaltender\nGarth Snow\n, who retired from his playing career to accept the position.\n[\n22\n]\nBefore his dismissal, Smith made several free agent acquisitions, including defensemen\nBrendan Witt\nand\nTom Poti\n, and forwards\nMike Sillinger\nand\nChris Simon\n.\n[\n72\n]\nOn September 12, 2006, the Islanders signed DiPietro to a 15-year, $67.5\u00a0million ($105.28\u00a0million in 2024 dollars\n[\n9\n]\n) contract, which was believed to be the longest contract to date in the NHL and the second-longest in North American sports, behind a 25-year contract for\nNational Basketball Association\nplayer\nMagic Johnson\n.\n[\n74\n]\n[\n75\n]\nDiPietro, Wang and Snow all spoke confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides, despite the mixed reactions it received from the rest of the hockey world. Specifically, Wang stated, \"This is not a big deal. You have to have a commitment to who you're working with.\"\n[\n74\n]\nAs speculation began as to whether other teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players,\nAtlanta Thrashers\n' general manager\nDon Waddell\nfelt that, \"It's highly unlikely that you will see teams go beyond that. This is a once-in-a-lifetime contract. Ownership must feel very strongly that he's their guy for the next 15 years.\"\n[\n75\n]\nBill Guerin\nwas the team captain from 2007 to 2009.\nThe new-look Islanders were picked by most analysts to languish towards the bottom of the standings.\n[\n76\n]\nEyeing a playoff spot, Snow traded for forward\nRyan Smyth\nfrom the\nEdmonton Oilers\nat the trade deadline on February 27, 2007.\n[\n77\n]\nInjuries to DiPietro provided extra setbacks, but not enough to drop the team from playoff contention.\n[\n78\n]\n[\n79\n]\nThey qualified for the playoffs, assisted by a late-season winning streak and a 3\u20132 shootout victory against the\nNew Jersey Devils\nin their final regular season game.\n[\n80\n]\nDespite DiPietro's return to the team in time for the playoffs, the team lost their first round matchup in five games to the\nPresidents' Trophy\n-winning\nBuffalo Sabres\n.\n[\n81\n]\nManagement announced in June 2007 that they would buy out captain\nAlexei Yashin\n's contract, which had four seasons remaining on it.\n[\n82\n]\nFree agents Smyth, Poti,\nViktor Kozlov\n,\nJason Blake\n, and\nRichard Zednik\nalso left in July 2007.\n[\n83\n]\n[\n84\n]\nDuring that month, the Islanders signed\nBill Guerin\nto a two-year contract as he immediately assumed team captaincy.\n[\n83\n]\nAlso in the off-season, free agents\nMike Comrie\n,\nAndy Sutton\nand\nJon Sim\njoined the team.\n[\n85\n]\n[\n86\n]\nThat summer, it was announced that Nolan extended an invitation to Al Arbour to return as a coach for one game in order to bring his total number of games coached to 1,500.\n[\n87\n]\n[\n88\n]\nArbour signed a one-day contract, the shortest in league history, on November 3, 2007; it put him behind the bench the following day as the Islanders defeated the\nPittsburgh Penguins\n3\u20132, raising his career coaching win total to 740.\n[\n89\n]\nThe team remained in the playoff hunt through the trade deadline as they re-signed Comrie to a one-year contract and traded away Simon and\nMarc-Andre Bergeron\n.\n[\n90\n]\nA rash of injuries saw them plummet to the fifth-worst record in the league by the end of the season.\n[\n91\n]\nJosh Bailey\nwas drafted by the Islanders in 2008, to provide depth at the wing for the team.\nAt the\n2008 NHL entry draft\n, the Islanders made two trades to move down from the fifth to the ninth overall pick, with which they selected center\nJosh Bailey\n. They also added free agents\nMark Streit\nand\nDoug Weight\n. The team dismissed head coach\nTed Nolan\nover alleged philosophy differences,\n[\n92\n]\n[\n93\n]\nand later that summer replaced him with\nScott Gordon\n.\n[\n94\n]\nNear the trade deadline, Snow traded Comrie and\nChris Campoli\nto the\nOttawa Senators\nin exchange for forward\nDean McAmmond\nand the\nSan Jose Sharks\n' first-round draft pick in the\n2009 NHL entry draft\nand sent captain Bill Guerin to the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin exchange for a conditional draft pick.\n[\n95\n]\n[\n96\n]\nIn the\n2008\u201309 season\n, the Islanders finished in last place in the league with a record of 26\u201347\u20139, which was the team's worst record since the 2000\u201301 season. After the conclusion of regular season, they won the draft lottery to retain the first overall pick in the\n2009 NHL entry draft\n.\n[\n97\n]\nThe Tavares era begins (2009\u20132015)\n[\nedit\n]\nBeginning an effort to rebuild the team with new and young talent, the Islanders selected\nJohn Tavares\nwith the first-overall pick of the\n2009 NHL entry draft\n.\n[\n98\n]\nTavares went into the draft as the top prospect in the majority of scouting reports,\n[\n99\n]\nand it was widely expected that the Islanders would select him after they secured the first overall pick by winning the draft lottery, although there was plenty of competition between Tavares,\nVictor Hedman\n, and\nMatt Duchene\n.\n[\n100\n]\nNHL Central Scouting Bureau\n's Chris Edwards spoke highly of him, stating, \"[Tavares] is phenomenal at getting the puck through traffic to his linemates, getting to opening. The way he reads the play and can get to where he figures the rebounds will be and bangs in the rebound. He's a real smart player.\"\n[\n101\n]\nThey traded up twice in the first round to also select defenseman\nCalvin de Haan\nwith the 12th overall pick,\n[\n102\n]\nas well as\nCasey Cizikas\nand\nAnders Lee\nin later rounds, all of whom would go on to play consistently on the main roster by the\n2014\u201315 season\n.\n[\n103\n]\nThe\n2009\u201310 season\nstarted out slow, with the team winless its first six games.\n[\n104\n]\nThe team continued to play inconsistently due to injuries as many wrote them off as potential playoff contenders.\n[\n105\n]\nThe team hit a mid-season hot streak,\n[\n106\n]\nhowever nine losses in 11 games before the Olympic break set them right back.\n[\n107\n]\nThey ultimately ended up at bottom of the standings again, finishing the season 26th in the league.\n[\n108\n]\nThe placement led to a fifth overall pick in\n2010\n. Continuing with their rebuilding process, they used the first round to draft young forwards\nNino Niederreiter\nand\nBrock Nelson\nwith picks five and 30, respectively.\n[\n109\n]\nAs the\n2010\u201311 season\ngot underway, the team quickly fell into a ten-game losing streak, leading to the firing of head coach\nScott Gordon\n.\n[\n110\n]\n[\n111\n]\nHe was replaced on an interim basis by\nJack Capuano\n, who had been coaching the Bridgeport Sound Tigers.\n[\n111\n]\n[\n112\n]\nEarly in the season, they also acquired\nMichael Grabner\nfrom waivers, who went on to score 34 goals and was selected as a finalist for the\nCalder Memorial Trophy\n;\n[\n113\n]\n[\n114\n]\nhe would go on to sign a five-year contract with the team at the end of the season.\n[\n114\n]\nThis year also featured the\nPenguins\u2013Islanders brawl\n, which resulted in a combined 346 penalty minutes and a $100,000 fine to the Islanders for \"failure to control their players\".\nJohn Tavares\n, was named an alternate captain for the\n2011\u201312 season\n. He was later named the team captain in 2013.\nThe\nfollowing season\nwas a breakout year for Tavares. The newly named assistant captain gained 31 goals and 50 assists,\n[\n115\n]\nin addition to being selected to play in the\n59th NHL All-Star Game\nat the age of 21;\n[\n116\n]\nhis 81 points were seventh-best in the league.\n[\n117\n]\nTavares' left-winger\nMatt Moulson\nalso had a strong season, finishing with career highs of 36 goals, 33 assists and 69 points.\n[\n118\n]\nDespite strong seasons from their top players, the team finished 27th in the league with a record of 34\u201337\u201311, continuing their pattern of racking up top prospects with early picks at the drafts.\n[\n119\n]\nThey used the first round of the\n2012 draft\nto select defenseman\nGriffin Reinhart\nwith the fourth overall pick.\n[\n120\n]\nOn August 1, 2011, voters in\nNassau County\nrejected a proposal for a new arena to replace Nassau Coliseum. This followed the failed decade-long attempt by owner Charles Wang to build a mixed-use development called\nThe Lighthouse Project\n, which would have renovated the arena.\n[\n121\n]\nIn the wake of the vote, speculation began that the team would eventually move to\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\n, new arenas in\nQueens\nor\nSuffolk County\n, the\nSprint Center\nin\nKansas City\n, or the\nVideotron Centre\nin\nQuebec City\n, the last of which was coincidentally set to open at the same time as the expiration of the Islanders' lease on the Nassau Coliseum in 2015.\n[\n122\n]\n[\n123\n]\n[\n124\n]\nOn October 24, 2012, the Islanders made the announcement that the franchise would indeed be moving to the\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\nfor the 2015\u201316 NHL season, after signing a lease that would keep the team in the arena until 2040. The team retained its name, logo and colors as part of the move.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n125\n]\nAs part of the deal, the management of Barclays Center took over the team's business operations once the Islanders moved to Barclays Center.\n[\n126\n]\nThe decision to move to Brooklyn didn't require the Rangers' approval. Under a longstanding provision of the agreement that allowed the Islanders to share the New York area with the Rangers, the Islanders are allowed to play their games anywhere on Long Island, including the two city boroughs on the island, Brooklyn and\nQueens\n.\n[\n127\n]\nBeginning on April 1, 2013, of the\n2012\u201313 season\n, the team went on a near month-long unbeaten streak in regulation time, posting a 12-game streak of earning points until falling to the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nlater that month.\n[\n128\n]\nDuring that streak, on April 23, 2013, they clinched their first playoff berth since 2007 with a 4\u20133 shootout loss to the\nCarolina Hurricanes\n, ending a six-year playoff drought.\n[\n128\n]\n[\n129\n]\nBehind goaltender\nEvgeni Nabokov\n, the team was ultimately eliminated in six games by the\nPittsburgh Penguins\nin the first round of the\nplayoffs\n, continuing their winless streak in playoff series.\n[\n130\n]\n[\n131\n]\nOn September 10, 2013, Tavares was introduced as the 14th captain in New York Islanders history, replacing former Islander Mark Streit of the Philadelphia Flyers, who served as team captain since 2011.\n[\n132\n]\nAfter posting a 4\u20134\u20133 record in their first 11 games, the Islanders made a trade, sending fan favorite and three-time 30-goal scorer Matt Moulson, their 2014 first-round draft pick and their 2015 second-round draft pick to the\nBuffalo Sabres\nin exchange for\nThomas Vanek\n, a highly regarded and dynamic goal scorer.\n[\n133\n]\n[\n134\n]\nDespite chemistry with linemates Tavares and\nKyle Okposo\n, however, his desire to test free agency and the team's impending move to\nBarclays Center\n[\n135\n]\nled to Vanek being dealt to the\nMontreal Canadiens\nat the trade deadline for\nSebastian Collberg\nand a second-round pick in\n2014\n.\n[\n136\n]\n[\n137\n]\nAfter a season of player swapping and goaltending issues, they failed to qualify for the\nplayoffs\n, finishing with a record of 34\u201337\u201311.\n[\n138\n]\nThe Islanders acquired\nNick Leddy\nthrough a trade with the\nChicago Blackhawks\nduring the 2014 off-season.\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Islanders made several moves to improve the team before their\nfinal season\nat Nassau Coliseum. In May, the Islanders acquired the rights to\nJaroslav Halak\nfrom the\nWashington Capitals\nin exchange for a fourth-round pick in 2014. Halak was then signed to a four-year contract. The Islanders also signed\nMikhail Grabovski\n,\nNikolai Kulemin\nand goaltender\nChad Johnson\nas free agents. Additionally, on October 4, the Islanders acquired\nJohnny Boychuk\nfrom the\nBoston Bruins\nfor two-second round picks in 2014 and\n2015\nand a conditional third-round pick in 2015, as well as\nNick Leddy\nfrom the\nChicago Blackhawks\nin exchange for prospect\nVille Pokka\n,\nT. J. Brennan\nand the rights to\nAnders Nilsson\n.\nThe NHL Board of Governors approved the Islanders' sale to businessmen\nJon Ledecky\nand\nScott D. Malkin\nin October 2014. Ledecky and Malkin served as minority partners during a two-year transition period. At the end of the 2015\u201316 season, they formally took majority control from Wang, who retained a share of the franchise.\n[\n139\n]\nThe Islanders finished the 2014\u201315 regular season with a record of 47\u201328\u20137 for 101 points, and met the Washington Capitals in the first round of the\n2015 playoffs\n. The Capitals held home-ice advantage in the series after the Islanders lost their final regular season game to the\nColumbus Blue Jackets\n, 5\u20134, in a shootout, as the Islanders lost the season series to the Capitals after posting a 2\u20131\u20131 record in the season series (Washington went 2\u20130\u20132, winning the season series with six points to the Islanders' five). On April 19, 2015, in the third game of their first-round series against Washington, John Tavares scored 15 seconds into overtime to win the game for the Islanders, 2\u20131. It was the second-shortest overtime playoff game in Islanders history, and was the first overtime, game-winning goal for the Islanders in the playoffs since 1993. The Islanders lost the fourth and fifth games of their series before rebounding in the sixth game to force a seventh game in the series. However, they were denied entry into the second round by a single goal and would ultimately fall to the Capitals in seven games. As a result, game 6 was the Islanders' last game at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum; the Isles'\nCal Clutterbuck\nscored the final NHL goal in the building's first run prior to the Islanders' return in 2018.\nMove to Barclays Center and playoff series win (2015\u20132017)\n[\nedit\n]\nIn June 2015, the Islanders entered the\n2015 draft\nwithout a first-round pick, but emerged with two first-rounders in\nMathew Barzal\nand\nAnthony Beauvillier\nafter a series of draft day trades.\n[\n140\n]\nThe Islanders also selected forward\nAndong Song\nin the sixth round of the 2015 draft, making him the first Chinese player to be drafted by an NHL team.\n[\n141\n]\nBarclays Center\nin\nBrooklyn\n. The Islanders played their home games there from 2015 to 2020.\nThe Islanders played their first regular season game at\nBarclays Center\non October 9, 2015, losing 3\u20132 in overtime to the\nChicago Blackhawks\n.\nArtem Anisimov\nscored the first regular season goal, while Tavares scored the first regular season Islanders goal. The Islanders posted the fourth-best penalty kill rate and allowed the fewest power-play goals during the season. However, in the last quarter of the regular season, some players, including Halak and defenseman\nTravis Hamonic\n, suffered key injuries. The team finished the regular season fourth in the Metropolitan Division with 100 points, enough to clinch the first wild card spot in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced off against the\nFlorida Panthers\n; goaltender\nThomas Greiss\nonly played in 40 minutes of playoff hockey with the\nSan Jose Sharks\nprior to this series. Both teams split the first four games of the series. The fifth game of the series proved to be a major turning point, as late season call-up\nAlan Quine\nscored the game-winning goal on the power play with four minutes left in double overtime to end the second-longest game in franchise history; that goal gave them a 3\u20132 series lead and a chance to clinch the series on home ice. In the sixth game, the Islanders trailed 1\u20130 for much of the game, but Tavares tied it late in the third period. Tavares would score again with the series-clinching goal in double overtime to give the Islanders their first playoff series win since 1993. In the second round of the playoffs, they faced the Tampa Bay Lightning for the first time since 2004. Despite winning the first game of the series, the Islanders lost their series to the Lightning in five games.\nAndrew Ladd\nprior to a game during the\n2016\u201317 season\n. Ladd signed with the Islanders as a free agent during the 2016 off-season.\nSummer of 2016 saw free agents and longtime Islanders Kyle Okposo, Frans Nielsen, and Matt Martin all depart the team, joining the\nBuffalo Sabres\n,\nDetroit Red Wings\n, and\nToronto Maple Leafs\n, respectively. Snow signed free agents\nAndrew Ladd\nfrom the\nChicago Blackhawks\nand\nJason Chimera\nfrom the\nWashington Capitals\nto help fill the gaps left behind.\n[\n142\n]\nAfter an underwhelming first half of the\n2016\u201317 season\n, posting a 17\u201317\u20138 record through 42 games, head coach Jack Capuano was relieved of duties, with assistant general manager\nDoug Weight\nbeing named interim head coach.\n[\n143\n]\nHaving coached the team since 2010, Capuano was the second-winningest coach in the team's history with 227 wins, also leading the team to their first playoff series win since 1993.\n[\n144\n]\nPrior to Capuano's release, goaltender Jaroslav Halak was placed on waivers, and eventually sent down to the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. Having carried three goaltenders for the second consecutive season, the decision was made to stick with the tandem of Greiss and back-up\nJean-Francois Berube\nafter Halak posted a 6\u20138\u20135 record with a .904 save percentage through the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season.\n[\n145\n]\nIn late January 2017, following a report by\nBloomberg News\nwhich speculated that Barclays Center was considering removing the Islanders due to poor attendance and effects on the venue's profit margins (reception to Barclays Center as a hockey venue was mixed partly due to obstructed view seats,\n[\n146\n]\nas well as features like an off-center scoreboard, and the Islanders had the third-worst average attendance in the entire league while playing at the venue),\nNewsday\nreported that Nassau County executive Edward Mangano had met with one of the team's co-owners, and told the paper that it was possible that the Islanders could return to the renovated Nassau Coliseum.\n[\n147\n]\n[\n148\n]\nHowever, commissioner\nGary Bettman\nconsidered the concept to be \"unviable\" (the renovation reduced the capacity of the arena to just under 14,000, which is smaller than any NHL arena), and noted that Ledecky and Malkin were pursuing a possible arena project at\nBelmont Park\n.\n[\n149\n]\nDespite winning their last six games of the 2016\u201317 season, the Islanders finished in ninth place in the Eastern Conference; they missed the playoffs by only one point when the Toronto Maple Leafs clinched the final playoff spot on the penultimate day of the season.\nEmergence of Barzal and management overhaul (2017\u2013present)\n[\nedit\n]\nOn February 9, 2018, rookie\nMathew Barzal\nrecorded his third five-point game, becoming only the second rookie to do so since\nJoe Malone\nin 1917\u201318 and tying a 100-year-old record in the process.\n[\n150\n]\nAt the end of the 2017\u201318 regular season, Barzal had 85 points (22 goals, 63 assists). He led his team and all NHL rookies in points, and was tied for 13th overall in scoring in the NHL. Barzal was the seventh rookie in NHL history, and first since\nSidney Crosby\nin 2005\u201306, to have scored at least 20 goals and 60 assists in a single season.\n[\n151\n]\nBarzal also tied Islanders legend,\nBryan Trottier\n's franchise record for rookie assists.\n[\n152\n]\nBarzal won the Calder Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year for his 85-point season, leading the closest candidate by 20 points and receiving 160 out of 164 first-place votes. Barzal was the first Islanders' player to win the award since\nBryan Berard\nin 1997, and he was the fifth Islanders' player overall to win the trophy, joining Islanders legends\nMike Bossy\n(1978), Trottier (1976), and\nDenis Potvin\n(1974).\n[\n151\n]\nIslanders players after a win against the\nColorado Avalanche\non January 6, 2020\nDuring the 2018 off-season, the Islanders announced that former\nNew Jersey Devils\nand\nToronto Maple Leafs\ngeneral manager\nLou Lamoriello\nwas named their president of hockey operations, with \"full authority over all hockey matters with the organization\", and would become general manager on June 5, 2018, replacing\nGarth Snow\n.\n[\n153\n]\n[\n154\n]\nAdditionally,\nBarry Trotz\nwas hired as head coach of the Islanders.

Then, after blowing a 3\u20131 series lead to the\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nthat extended the series to seven games, the Islanders would go on to win game 7 against the Flyers and advance to the conference finals for the first time since the\n1993 playoffs\n. However, their run would come to an end at the hands of the\nTampa Bay Lightning\nin six games. In December 2020, New York Islanders Hockey Club, L.P. bought the remaining 15 percent stake of the team from the\nestate of Charles Wang\nand took full ownership of the team.\n[\n169\n]\n[\n170\n]\n[\n171\n]\nThe Islanders again made the playoffs in the shortened 2020\u201321 season, defeating the Penguins and Bruins each in six games.

The lower part of the Y is made to resemble a hockey stick, with three orange stripes near the bottom of the shaft and a puck to the right of the stick blade. At the bottom of the logo, the name of the team is written so that the tip of the \"I\" ends in a point aimed at\nUniondale\n, the location of Nassau Coliseum.\nBefore the\n1995\u201396 season\n, the Islanders attempted to update their look by introducing a new logo depicting a fisherman holding a hockey stick. The new logo was a marketing disaster; the reaction among the fanbase was so negative that management announced it would revert to the original logo as soon as league rules allowed them to do so. Many found that the logo bore a strong resemblance to the\nGorton's fisherman\n; indeed,\nNew York Rangers\nfans taunted the Islanders with chants of \"We want\nfishsticks\n!\" long after the logo was discarded.\n[\n184\n]\nThe traditional logo was phased back in over the next two seasons, starting as an\nalternate jersey\nlogo in\n1996\u201397\nbefore fully replacing the fisherman in\n1997\u201398\n. The only change to the classic logo at this time was its colors; as the team had replaced its original royal blue with navy, the logo was recolored to match.\nThe short-lived \"Fisherman\" logo, used from 1995 to 1997\nBeginning in\n2008\u201309\n, the Islanders introduced another modification to their original logo for their new third jersey. The \"new\" logo, once again in royal blue, now features four orange stripes on the hockey stick instead of three, representing the four consecutive Stanley Cup titles won by the team in the 1980s. This became the team's full-time logo in 2010.\nFor their\n2014 Stadium Series\nspecial jerseys, the Islanders used a simplified jersey logo with just the \"NY\" from their regular logo. Versions of that have since appeared on third jersey designs.\nJerseys\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Islanders debuted in 1972 with traditional-style jerseys: one was white with orange and royal blue stripes near the waistline and on the sleeves, the other was royal blue with white and orange stripes. The design remained largely the same, with only minor tweaks through the\n1994\u201395 season\n.\nPrior to the\n1995\u201396 season\n, team executives decided to change the jersey. The fisherman logo replaced the \"NY\" circular design, incorporating navy blue and a brighter orange, and introducing teal and gray shades. The team was seeking increased merchandise revenues, with the outward justification of connecting the team more overtly to Long Island. The jersey included a lighthouse shoulder patch, a reference to the\nMontauk Lighthouse\n, and featured uneven stripes resembling an ocean wave near the waistline, on the sleeves, and across the shoulders. All of the numbering and lettering on the jerseys also followed the wave pattern.\n[\n185\n]\nLate in the season, the team eliminated the fisherman logo, but league rules forbade them from switching jersey designs for the\n1996\u201397 season\non only a few months' notice. Instead, they debuted their first\nthird (and fourth) jerseys\n, which were identical to the home and road jerseys worn by the team, except the circular \"NY\" crest, now colored in the navy blue and bright orange shades to match, replaced the fisherman logo. The team wore these jerseys in approximately 15 games during that season and adopted them permanently in the\n1997\u201398 season\n.\nThe shoulder logo used on Islanders jerseys from 1998 through 2010\nPrior to the\n1998\u201399 season\n, the team's jerseys reverted to a traditional design but kept the navy blue and bright orange shades from the jerseys used the previous three seasons. They added a shoulder patch of four bars, alternating in color, to represent the Islanders' four Stanley Cup championships. A predominantly orange third jersey was introduced in\n2002\u201303\n, featuring navy blue yokes and sides that formed sharp points on the sleeves and body. The team wore this jersey through the\n2006\u201307 season\n.\nFor the\n2007\u201308 season\n, the Islanders redesigned their uniforms as all NHL teams changed over to the\nReebok Edge\nsystem. These jerseys resembled the prior design but included uniform numbers on the right chest above the logo. The name plates were also in two colored format: white on orange on the navy blue home jersey and navy blue on orange on the white road jersey. The sleeves on both jerseys were orange, with a wide navy stripe above a thin white stripe at the elbow. The jerseys had a thin stripe tracing around the shoulders, and featured \"retro\" laces at the neck.\nA royal blue throwback design was introduced the following season as a third jersey. Before the\n2010\u201311 season\n, the Islanders made this throwback design their new home jersey. A corresponding new white road jersey was unveiled during the Islanders'\ndraft\nparty at Nassau Coliseum.\n[\n186\n]\nFor the following season, they unveiled an alternate jersey in black with grey on the shoulder yoke. The front of the jersey bore the team name above the player's number in orange with blue and white trim. The Islanders crest was placed on the shoulder yoke. Diagonal side panels, blue trimmed in orange and gray, combined with similar panels on the black pants to form a diamond shape on the sides of each player. These were only used sparing for two seasons, as they proved unpopular.\nDuring the\n2014 Stadium Series\n, the Islanders wore a special edition jersey. The front side featured the \"NY\" from the primary logo in a special chrome treatment, while the back side featured a white nameplate with blue letters for player names, and bigger numbers in white trimmed in orange for visibility purposes. The sleeve numbers were also angled diagonally. The primary Islanders logo would be placed on the left shoulder within the white yoke. This jersey was promoted to an alternate third jersey in the\n2014\u201315 season\n, replacing the black third jersey. During that season, on February 3, 2015, the team wore an updated version of the fisherman jersey for warmups before their game against the\nFlorida Panthers\n.\n[\n187\n]\n[\n188\n]\nThe Islanders retired the Stadium Series third jersey after only one season, replacing it with a new black alternate that was unveiled to coincide with the team's move to Brooklyn. Unlike the previous black alternate, this version featured little blue and orange at all (these colors appear only on the rear collar), while the \"NY\" insignia that was carried over from the Stadium Series jersey was stripped of its chrome accents. The four narrow white stripes on the sleeves symbolize the franchise's four Stanley Cup wins.\nWhen the NHL switched to\nAdidas\nas its uniform provider in 2017, the Islanders kept their primary jerseys mostly intact except for the restoration of the blue trim in the primary logo on the road jersey. As with all NHL teams, the Islanders only wore two jerseys for the 2017\u201318 season, thus retiring the all-black third jerseys.\nThe Islanders released a new blue third jersey for the 2018\u201319 season, featuring an updated \"NY\" insignia (shorter \"Y-stick\" with four orange stripes on the blade), white shoulder yoke (reminiscent of the 2014 Stadium Series alternates), the map of Long Island on the collar, and orange numbers that call back to the jerseys used during the team's inaugural season.\n[\n189\n]\nIn the 2020\u201321 season, the Islanders released a special \"Reverse Retro\" alternate uniform. The uniform resembled their current home jerseys, but used the navy blue and bright orange scheme worn from 1995 to 2010.\n[\n190\n]\nA second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was released in the 2022\u201323 season, using the \"Fisherman\" uniform from 1995 to 1997 but with less teal elements and diagonal orange striping.\n[\n191\n]\nDuring the\n2024 Stadium Series\n, the Islanders wore navy blue jerseys with a thick orange middle stripe. \"ISLES\" in navy blue letters was added within the orange stripe, as are the navy blue numbers.\n[\n192\n]\nThe Islanders reverted to wearing only their primary jerseys after\nFanatics\ntook over as the NHL uniform provider in 2024, even though it kept most aspects of Adidas' template and retained the use of third jerseys.\nMascot and Ice Girls\n[\nedit\n]\nIce Girls at a community event in 2013\nThe Islanders' team mascot is named \"\nSparky the Dragon\n\", who served at one point as cross-promotion with the\nArena Football League\n's\nNew York Dragons\nteam, who also played their home games at Nassau Coliseum. In the mid-1990s, the Islanders had a mascot named \"Nyisles\" whose body style went from round to human-shaped, and facial features vaguely resembled the logo fisherman, excluding its red hair and beard. Nyisles was discontinued toward the end of the\n1997\u201398 season\nwhen the team distributed \"Who kidnapped Nyisles?\" flyers implying the reason for his disappearance was because of another NHL mascot, ultimately revealed to be\nToronto Maple Leafs\nmascot\nCarlton the Bear\n. Nyisles returned as the secondary mascot of the club with a brand new look in December 2022 to coincide with the return of the Fisherman logo on the team's reverse retro uniforms.\n[\n193\n]\nFrom the 2001\u201302 season to the 2014\u201315 season, the Islanders also had an ice crew named the \"Ice Girls\", made up of only women who skated onto the ice during television breaks to clean up the snow that piled up during the game. The Ice Girls were also used for promotional purposes during games and at community events. Starting in the 2015\u201316 season, a co-ed ice crew would replace the Ice Girls.\nSeason-by-season record\n[\nedit\n]\nThis is only a partial list of the last five seasons.

Because who would\u2019ve thought that Ottawa would have more points than the \u2018Hawks at the start of March? 2012-end-times sort of thing, maybe. But, either way, them\u2019s the breaks. Chicago needs two points pretty badly and, hey, so does the other team. Yet another reason why they play the games! Johnny Toews (alias Bruce Wayne (alias Batman)) is still out after being concussed on-ice and then driving his car into an Elevated Train support (an accident that has absolutely nothing to do with the concussion), and Nicklas \u201cLucky\u201d Hjalmarsson is also out with a bad case of the \u2018my brains don\u2019t feel so hot\u2019s. If the \u2018Hawks wanna win, they\u2019re gonna need big games from Marian Hossa and Raymond Emory\u2026 hey wait\u2026 they used to play for the Ottawa Senators! Watch as things get <em>awkward</em>.</p>\n<p>IF YOU ASK ME, I THINK: Chris Campoli will be invited to a ceremony &#8216;honoring&#8217; his time with both squads. But it&#8217;s an ambush! It turns out it&#8217;s a celebrity roast (well&#8230; not really a celebrity roast. It&#8217;s Chris Campoli.)

Because once it is nice outside, you do not want to scrub your house. Saturday is not looking so nice. And I\u2019ve seen your house and it is filthy. So clean it! Get those Dorritos out the couch, mop up <em>behind </em>the toilet, and don\u2019t breathe too deeply around that bucket of chemicals you\u2019ll be using to work miracles.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_843\" style=\"width: 160px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/spring-cleaning1.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-843\" data-attachment-id=\"843\" data-permalink=\"https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/it-is-the-freaking-weekend/spring-cleaning-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/spring-cleaning1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"354,339\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 40D&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1232805281&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.004&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"spring-cleaning\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Clean up your act.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/spring-cleaning1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/spring-cleaning1.jpg?w=354\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-843\" title=\"spring-cleaning\" src=\"https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/spring-cleaning1.jpg?w=150&#038;h=143\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"143\" srcset=\"https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/spring-cleaning1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/spring-cleaning1.jpg?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-843\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Clean up your act.</p></div>\n<p>AN ANIMITRONIC GYPSY AT THE CARNIVAL GAVE ME THIS FORTUNE: Clean up your house.

I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re mostly good people, too. But, <em>qua</em> hockey fans, we should appreciate a team that plays the game well. So, I guess you must like the Bruins&#8230; that was easy.</p>\n<p><strong>Huskey</strong>: Hold on, Con&#8217;s got something to say, though. Con?</p>\n<p><strong>Con</strong>: Thank you. You shouldn&#8217;t actually like <em>the way</em> they play. Cuz they kinda play like jerks. Oh, and there were two cons stuck together here, too&#8230; I also don&#8217;t like a lot of their players.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro</strong>: Well, obviously, the Bruins are mostly professional ice hockey players (pros), so there&#8217;s that to consider.

Keeps things interesting. And they can back up that attitude with their play on the ice (even if their attitude off the ice is e-<em>noy</em>-ing).

Well, since the Friday night scene is looking a little <em>stale </em>of late, maybe you should just gather your real-life friends together and listen to your internet friends&#8217; latest installment of the T-Bone and the Hockey Doggz Podcast-stravaganza. This episode really had it all (well, not Pat Sajak, but he\u2019s what Cookie Monster would call a <em>sometimes </em>treat (welcome to Michelle Obama\u2019s America, people!)). There\u2019s still time to bid $30 for one of our beautiful, hand-made buttons, too, or purchase the three-pack bundle for a cool Benjamin. Although watching the Blackhawks and the Panthers tussle might wind up being fun, listening to us field questions from hockey-lovin\u2019 dark lords is <em>definitely, assuredly, 100% guaranteed <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">fun</span></strong></em>.</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: </em>Moonpie nearly dies at the end, but T-Bone finds the serum at the last possible moment. <em></em></p>\n<p><em>EXTRA SPOILER ALERT: </em>You might wanna fast-forward through that last scene if you\u2019re squeamish about needles, because T-Bone has to pop that sucker right through ol\u2019 Moopie\u2019s sternum <em>a la </em>Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace in<em> Pulp Fiction.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>21 January 2012</p>\n<p>Rangers at Bruins</p>\n<p>Now here\u2019s what you\u2019d call a good hockey game. On the one hand you have the Bruins, a ruff\u2019n\u2019tumble crew lead by hockey Golem Zdeno Chara. Then you got the Rangers, who have a real Viking between the pipes.

They now have it in your power to make dreams come true.</p>\n<p>The Caps, meanwhile, may have preferred not to acknowledge their own psychic abilities in the past, but today they could prove impossible to ignore. Visions, premonitions, and telepathic messages from others could pop into their minds all game long.

Darren later becomes the only one who is aware of the situation. And the stakes are raised when the terrorists announce that they will blow-up the building at the end of the game. Therefore, Darren must not only subdue the terrorists, but postpone the game and send it to overtime, where the Pens win on a nifty goal by Jordan Staal. Instead of blowing the arena up, though, the terrorists are so caught up in their newfound love of hockey that they forget about the explosives and head to the Consol Energy Penguins Team Store to get some authentic merchandise. Oh, and Darren McCord ends up sounding fucking <em>cray-zee </em>when he tries explaining how he was the \u201conly one who [was] aware of the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>7 January 2011</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Canucks v. Bruins</strong></p>\n<p>File this one under &#8216;hockey is amazing&#8217;, guys! I don&#8217;t know what all to say. These two heavies met up in last year&#8217;s Stanley Cup Final and Boston won in seven. If you don&#8217;t recall, it was a pretty chippy series and nobody should be surprised if there&#8217;s some chipper chipping happening when these two teams rumble in Saturday&#8217;s big showdown at high noon (CST). Although this is only a regular season game, plenty of prognosticators, prophets, and visionaries see this as a potential rematch for this year&#8217;s cup, since both teams are doing some real next-level shit these days. The only thing I&#8217;m predicting for Saturday is some beer and an orphaned pizza left on my doorstep.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_595\" style=\"width: 374px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wooah.jpeg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-595\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"595\" data-permalink=\"https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/2012/01/06/freakin-weekend-its-the/wooah/\" data-orig-file=\"https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wooah.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"500,375\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"wooah\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Images like this are not hard to find on the internet&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wooah.jpeg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wooah.jpeg?w=500\" class=\" wp-image-595\" title=\"wooah\" src=\"https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wooah.jpeg?w=364&#038;h=273\" alt=\"\" width=\"364\" height=\"273\" srcset=\"https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wooah.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wooah.jpeg?w=364 364w, https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wooah.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://tboneandthehockeydoggz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wooah.jpeg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-595\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Images like this are not hard to find with the help of the internet</p></div>\n<p><strong>Wait, what did you say was going to happen?</strong> What, the pizza thing?

I think the most realistic option for Panther victory involves taking the Bruins to the beach and then praying that they find that elusive cheeseburger in paradise and/or waste away in Margaritaville. If this plan goes like I think it will, they&#8217;ll be trading in their skates and sticks for flip flops and a metal detector in no time.</p>\n<p>2.

Of course, their usual path to victory would involve physically and emotionally abusing the other team through a series of put-downs, zingers, and nasty tricks the Flyers picked up in high school/hanging out on Broad Street after-school. But with the newest round of anti-bullying legislation making its way through the legislature, they can only hope to be grandfathered in and remain exempt from prosecution under the state&#8217;s stringent new laws.</p>\n<p>Well, right now it looks like there&#8217;s no stopping a team like Boston&#8230; But that&#8217;s just on paper. And whatever they&#8217;re writing the internet on these days. Nobody&#8217;s serving a second helping of chowder out of Lord Stanley&#8217;s Cup just yet. A lot will happen over the next 40 or so games and some of the luster is sure to erode off the polished turd that is the Bruins before the playoffs even begin.

Sinclair\non May 1, 1916. The\nSinclair Oil and Refining Corporation\namalgamated the assets of 11 small petroleum companies.\n[\n3\n]\nOriginally a\nNew York\ncorporation, Sinclair Oil reincorporated in\nWyoming\nin 1976.\n[\n4\n]\nThe corporate logo featured the silhouette of a large green\nBrontosaurus\ndinosaur\n, based on the then-common idea that oil deposits beneath the earth came from the dead bodies of dinosaurs.\nSinclair was ranked as one of the largest privately owned American corporations.\n[\n1\n]\nIt owned and operated refineries, gas stations, hotels, a ski resort, and a cattle ranch.\n[\n1\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nSinclair has long been a fixture on American roads with its dinosaur logo and mascot, an\nApatosaurus\n.\n1916\u20131969\n[\nedit\n]\nA restored Sinclair station in\nAlbany, Texas\nA restored\nSinclair station\non the\nNational Register of Historic Places\nDuring September 1919, Harry Sinclair restructured Sinclair Oil and Refining Corporation,\nSinclair Gulf Corporation\n, and 26 other related entities into\nSinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation\n.\n[\n5\n]\nIn 1932, this new entity was renamed\nConsolidated Oil Corporation\n. In 1943, it was renamed\nSinclair Oil Corporation\n.\n[\n6\n]\nNear the beginning of the\nGreat Depression\n, Sinclair sold the remaining interest in its pipeline subsidiary to\nStandard Oil Company (Indiana)\nfor US$72.5 million (Standard Oil had purchased a 50% interest in the pipeline subsidiary in 1921).\n[\n7\n]\nWith these funds, including an additional US$33.5 million from an additional\ncommon stock\nissue, Sinclair retired several\npromissory notes\nand prepared to weather the Depression with the remaining supply of cash.\nBetween 1921 and 1922, Sinclair leased oil production rights to Teapot Dome in Wyoming without competitive bidding. This led to the\nTeapot Dome scandal\n.\n[\n8\n]\nAt the same time, Sinclair Oil was approached by the Italian fascist government.\nBenito Mussolini\n's government wanted to increase competition in the Italian oil market, which was controlled by the Italo-American Petroleum Society (SIAP), which in turn was fully dominated by\nStandard Oil\n.\n[\n9\n]\nAs the Teapot Dome scandal unfolded in the\nUnited States\nand reached the international press, Mussolini accelerated the negotiations, with a deal signed on May 4, 1924 (although without an official meeting, to avoid public outcry). Because of this, Sinclair Oil Company is known for having made \"large payments to leading Fascists \u2014 all acting as intermediaries for Benito Mussolini \u2014 in return for an exclusive monopoly to drill for oil on Italian soil and in the Italian colonies\".\n[\n10\n]\nThe deal was reported in a press release by the Head of Government (Mussolini) issued on the night of May 15, 1924, and published by most newspapers on the following day. The press release assured the public that Sinclair Oil had been awarded its contract on a competitive basis and had provided guarantees it had no relations with the international oil trust.\n[\n11\n]\nThis case of corruption was reported by the anti-fascist politician\nGiacomo Matteotti\n- who was later kidnapped and killed by Mussolini's newborn secret police, just before he could report his discoveries to the Parliament \u2014 in his posthumous article, published in the July issue of\nEnglish Life\n(a magazine founded by\nBrendan Bracken\n): Matteotti accused Sinclair Oil of being a pawn of Standard Oil, as well as revealing \"grave irregularities concerning the concession.\"\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\nMatteotti's theses were echoed in the notes of Epifanio Pennetta, who contributed to the preliminary investigation on the murder: \"To all appearances,\" companies like Nafta and Saper \"were in competition with the Sinclair company, while in fact they were in cahoots with Sinclair\" and added that Sinclair Oil was actually working \"in concert\" with Standard Oil.\n[\n14\n]\nDuring the Great Depression, Sinclair saved many other petroleum companies from\nreceivership\nor\nbankruptcy\nand\nacquired\nothers to expand its operations. In 1932, Sinclair purchased the assets of Prairie Oil and Gas' pipeline and producing companies in the\nsouthern United States\n, and the Rio Grande Oil Company in California.\n[\n15\n]\nThe purchase of Prairie also gave Sinclair a 65% interest in Producers and Refiners Corporation (or Parco), which Sinclair subsequently acquired when Parco entered receivership in 1934. Lastly, in 1936, Sinclair purchased the East Coast marketing subsidiary of Richfield Oil Company, which had operated in receivership for several years. Richfield then reorganized, resulting in the creation of the Richfield Oil Corporation. Sinclair was instrumental in transferring capital and managerial assets into Richfield. Thirty years later, Richfield merged with\nAtlantic Refining\n, located on the East Coast, forming\nAtlantic Richfield\n.\n[\n16\n]\nSinclair Dinoland plastic brontosaurus, 1964, in the collection of\nThe Children's Museum of Indianapolis\nAt the\nChicago World's Fair of 1933\u20131934\n, Sinclair sponsored a dinosaur exhibit meant to play on the link between the formation of petroleum deposits and the time of dinosaurs, now a largely discredited misconception.\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\nThe exhibit included a 2-ton animated model of a\nBrontosaurus\n.\n[\n19\n]\nThe exhibit proved so popular it inspired a promotional line of rubber brontosaurs at Sinclair stations, complete with wiggling heads and tails, and the eventual inclusion of the brontosaur logo. Later, inflatable dinosaurs were given as promotional items. An\nanthropomorphic\nversion appeared as a service-station attendant in advertisements. Some locations have a life-size model of the mascot straddling the building's entrance.\nIn the early 1960s, Sinclair, along with Henry W. Peters and his son Eric Woods, developed the Turbo-S aircraft oils used for reliability in\ncommercial jets\n, military jets, guided\nmissiles\nand\nspace exploration rockets\n.\n[\n20\n]\nAt the\nNew York World's Fair of 1964\u20131965\n, Sinclair again sponsored a dinosaur exhibit, \"Dinoland\", featuring life-size replicas of nine different dinosaurs, including their signature\nBrontosaurus\n. Souvenirs from the exhibit included a brochure (\"Sinclair and the Exciting World of Dinosaurs\") and featured molded plastic dinosaur figurines. After the Fair closed, Dinoland remained as a traveling exhibit.\n[\n19\n]\n[\n21\n]\n[\n22\n]\nTwo of the replicas (\nTyrannosaurus\nand\nBrontosaurus\n) are still on display at\nDinosaur Valley State Park\nnear Glen Rose, Texas.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\nAnother, a model of a\nTrachodon\n, has been displayed at\nBrookfield Zoo\noutside\nChicago, Illinois\n.\n[\n22\n]\nA replica of a\nTriceratops\nis  owned by the\nKentucky Science Center\nin\nLouisville\n,\nKentucky\nand after a 2022 restoration was mounted above their parking garage.\n[\n25\n]\nThe Ankylosaurus is at the\nHouston Museum of Natural Science\n's Sugar Lands location. The Ornithomimus is at the\nMilwaukee Public Museum\n. The Stegosaurus is on display in front of the Visitor Center of Dinosaur National Monument in Utah.  A copy of the Triceratops is also owned by the\nSmithsonian Institution\nand is on display as \"\nUncle Beazley\n\" in the\nNational Zoological Park\nin\nWashington, D.C.\n[\n26\n]\nIn 1955, Sinclair ranked 21st on the\nFortune 500\n; by 1969, it had fallen to 58th.\n[\n27\n]\nARCO era\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\ndoes not\ncite\nany\nsources\n.\nPlease help\nimprove this section\nby\nadding citations to reliable sources\n. Unsourced material may be challenged and\nremoved\n.\n(\nApril 2019\n)\n(\nLearn how and when to remove this message\n)\nIn 1969, Sinclair merged with the\nAtlantic Richfield Company\n(ARCO) after an attempted acquisition by the\nGulf+Western Industries\nCorporation. Federal antitrust provisions required the new entity to divest itself of certain Sinclair assets. As a result, the\nEast Coast\noperations of Sinclair were sold to\nBP\n. After the ARCO acquisition, many Sinclair stations in the Midwest continued to use the dinosaur logo and opted out of using ARCO's \"diamond spark\" logo. Some northwest Sinclair stations partially retained the Sinclair brand for a time, using ARCO's blue rectangular logo, including the \"spark\" graphic, but with the word \"Sinclair\" substituted for ARCO.\nHolding era\n[\nedit\n]\nRestored Sinclair gas pump\nIn 1976, ARCO spun off Sinclair by selling certain assets to\nRobert (Earl) Holding\n. Assets\ndivested\nin the\nspin-off\nincluded ARCO's retail operations in the region bounded by the\nMississippi River\nand the\nRocky Mountains\n, and the rights to the Sinclair brand and logo, resulting in many stations along\nInterstate 80\nkeeping the dinosaur logo. The ARCO stations in\nTexas\n,\nNew Mexico\n,\nIllinois\n, and some portions of\nOklahoma\nwere not affected by the divestiture. They continued as part of ARCO until ARCO pulled out of those states in the 1980s.\nHeadquartered in Salt Lake City, Sinclair was the 94th-largest private company in the\nUnited States\n.\n[\n28\n]\nThere were 2,607 Sinclair\nfilling stations\nin 20 states in the Western and\nMidwestern United States\n. As of 2010, the corporation operated two refineries\u2014one in\nCasper, Wyoming\n, and one in\nSinclair, Wyoming\n. Sinclair operated a third refinery in\nTulsa, Oklahoma\n, until it was sold to\nHolly Corporation\non December 1, 2009. Sinclair's other operations included 1,000 miles of pipeline.\nIn the mid-2010s, Sinclair fuel stations began actively spreading across southern California, including\nLos Angeles\n,\nSan Diego\n, and\nFresno\n, with holders offering attractive deals for potential clients to make the switch from a private brand to the Sinclair name brand.\n[\n29\n]\nBy 2018, Sinclair gas stations were widely distributed across the United States, with dozens of gas stations in California,\nColorado\n,\nIowa\n,\nIdaho\n,\nMinnesota\n,\nMissouri\n,\nMontana\n,\nNebraska\n,\nNevada\n, Oklahoma,\nOregon\n,\nSouth Dakota\n,\nUtah\n, and Wyoming; smaller numbers in\nArizona\n,\nConnecticut\n,\nKansas\n,\nKentucky\n,\nNorth Dakota\n,\nNew Mexico\n,\nNew York\n,\nTexas\n, and\nWashington\n; and a single station in\nArkansas\nand\nWisconsin\n.\n[\n30\n]\nSinclair continued to use the green dinosaur, affectionately called \"Dino\", and marketed all its products under the logo. Sinclair\npatented\nthe gasoline additive SG-2000. The high-octane fuel blend was called \"Dino Supreme\" and regular gas was \"Dino\", trade names used since 1961 when many oil companies still used trade names for their fuels instead of generic terms such as \"regular,\" \"premium,\" or \"unleaded\". Before that time, Sinclair's trade names for its gasoline products included \"Power X\" for high-octane fuel and \"Sinclair H-C\" for regular gas. Sinclair also has marketed products such as Dino, Dino Supreme, and Opaline motor oils.\nSinclair filling station along Idaho Street (Interstate 80 Business) near College Avenue in\nElko, Nevada\n.\nIn August 2021,\nHollyFrontier\nannounced the acquisition of Sinclair Oil. A new company named\nHF Sinclair Corporation\nwould be formed in 2022. Under the agreements, Sinclair Oil's branded marketing business and all related commercial activities and its refineries and related operations and assets in Casper and Sinclair, Wyoming, would be combined with HollyFrontier. Sinclair Oil's logistics and storage assets, including approximately 1,200 miles of pipelines, two crude oil terminals and eight light product terminals, would be combined with Holly Energy Partners (HEP). It was expected that the vast majority of Sinclair Oil employees would be invited to continue in their positions following the combination. The transaction did not include exploration and production assets owned by Sinclair Oil & Gas Co.\n[\n31\n]\nSinclair Trucking Company\n[\nedit\n]\nCompany-owned Sinclair Trucking\n[\n32\n]\nprovided distribution for Sinclair Oil fuels and other related products.

These properties were not part of the sale to HollyFrontier, and continue to be owned by the Holding Family.\nHF Sinclair Corporation\n[\nedit\n]\nIn March 2022, the sale to HollyFrontier was completed, and\nHF Sinclair Corporation\ntraded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol DINO.\n[\n33\n]\nIn popular culture\n[\nedit\n]\nOld Sinclair Dino gas pump\nThe \"Sinclair's Dino\" balloon first appeared in the\nMacy's Thanksgiving Day Parade\nin 1963, returning to the parade in 2015 after a more than 50-year absence. The balloon is an honorary member of New York's\nMuseum of Natural History\nas of 1977.  It is 36 feet (11\u00a0m) tall, 72 feet (22\u00a0m) long, and 24 feet (7.3\u00a0m) wide.\n[\n34\n]\nThe\nBrontosaurus\nlogo is parodied in the\nToy Story\nand\nCars\nfranchise films as being the \"Dinoco\" gas station chain, perhaps an allusion to gasoline and its origin as a\nfossil fuel\n, as well as a\nportmanteau\nbetween the \"\ndinosaur\n\" in Sinclair's logo and the suffixes of the \"\nAmoco\n\", \"\nConoco\n\", and \"\nSunoco\n\" franchises.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe TV series\nDinosaurs\nfeatured several characters with names derived from\nfossil fuel\ncompanies.  The main character and his family had the surname Sinclair.\nSinclair once had a service station in\nMontgomery, Alabama\n, in the Cloverdale neighborhood, that closed in the 1970s. That location was remodeled in 1992 into a restaurant named Sinclair's in honor of the former neighborhood station. The ownership group also opened two other locations, one at\nLake Martin\nand one on the eastside. The lake and Cloverdale locations were closed by 2018, while the eastside location has flourished for nearly 30 years as of 2023.\nJoey Jordison\n, founding drummer of\nSlipknot\n, worked at a Sinclair's garage in\nUrbandale, Iowa\n, where late at night the band would discuss their plans.\nDistribution\n[\nedit\n]\nDuring the first 10 months of 1929 Sinclair Refining, the marketing subsidiary of Sinclair Oil, acquired a total of 1,511 bulk distribution plants, service stations and re-sale outlets and the businesses of the 59 associated companies.

The sculptor, Louis Paul Jonas, executed these prehistoric animals in fiberglass, after the designs of Barnum and Ostrom, for the Sinclair Refining Company's Pavilion at the New York World's Fair of 1964. After the Fair closed, the nine dinosaurs, which weighed between 2 and 4 tons each, were placed on trucks and taken on a tour of the Eastern United States. The Sinclair Refining Company promoted the tour for public relations and advertising, since their trademark was the dinosaur. In 1967, the nine dinosaurs were given to various American museums.\nThis particular replica was used for the filming of\nThe Enormous Egg\n, a movie made by the\nNational Broadcasting Company\nfor television, based on a children's book of the same name by Oliver Buttersworth.

    "evidence": "A 10-Week Sprint to Election Day | The Texas Tribune\nSkip to main content\nCredit:\nGraphic by Todd Wiseman\nThe conventions start next week, with Republicans going first, in Tampa, and Democrats following, in Charlotte. Both parties are going South, but they're interested in swing states.\nTexas isn't one.\nThat means the money scooped up by the partisans (candidates, Super PACs, parties, etc.) will be used mostly in other states. You'll be spared the electronic political invasion on TV every night \u2014\u00a0at least the advertising form of it\u00a0\u2014 but you won't get to see what the voters in the swing states get to see, either.\nThe conventions don't really settle anything political like they once did. These are now marketing exercises that aim to do for the candidates what the Olympics did for Coca-Cola.\nThey also serve as the unofficial starting gun for the November general elections.\nTexans will get some face time, but not a lot.\nJuli\u00e1n Castro\n, San Antonio's mayor, will give the keynote speech for the Democrats. Republican U.S. Senate nominee\nTed Cruz\nwill have a prominent spot at the GOP gathering. U.S. Rep.\nFrancisco \"Quico\" Canseco\nof San Antonio will speak to his fellow Republicans; he's in the state's lone congressional swing district with Democratic state Rep.\nPete Gallego\nchallenging. Planned Parenthood chief\nCecile Richards\n\u2014\u00a0daughter of the former governor \u2014\u00a0will speak to the Democrats, as will actress\nEva Longoria\n.\nThe Texas delegation will be big, but the front and center seats and the close-in hotels will be occupied not by Texans but by delegates from the states that are actually in play. That's the way the game works.\nWhich races are really and truly competitive? That argument is really just starting. Here's a starter list, with our usual caveat: Some of these will turn out to be duds and some races that now appear to be dull will turn out to be loud and noisy and competitive after all. Any number of noncompetitive races could become close if the frontrunner gets his or her mouth around his or her foot.\nAt this point, we're basing this on numbers from past elections, including the 2008 presidential race, the 2010 gubernatorial race, and in the case of the Texas Weekly Index, the average difference between Democrats and Republicans in contested statewide races in the last two election cycles. The numbers tell a mixed story sometimes, and any decent political consultants can find something somewhere that argues on behalf of their candidates. Enough weaseling. Here we go:\nCongress\n\u2022 CD-23, where Canseco faces Gallego. It's competitive on paper. Both national parties are worked up about it. And although the lines have been redrawn, this area of the state has flipped back and forth between the parties several times over the last decade. For what it's worth, both the Libertarian and Green parties also have candidates:\nJeffrey Blunt\nand\nEd Scharf\n, respectively.\n\u2022 Stick CD-14 in the \"maybe\" column. It's a Republican district on paper, but it's an open seat since\nRon Paul\ndecided not to seek re-election, and the personalities might make it interesting. The Republicans nominated state Rep.\nRandy Weber\nof Pearland. The Democrat is former U.S. Rep.\nNick Lampson\nof Beaumont.\nState Board of Education\n\u2022 Republican\nCharlie Garza\nis seeking re-election in a district that tends to vote for Democrats. Obama won easily here in 2008. Perry lost with 44.5 percent two years later. Statewide Democrats win by an average of 9.6 percent. The Democratic challenger is\nMartha Dominguez\n.\n\u2022\u00a0The open SBOE-2 seat is a true swing district on paper, with Democrat\nRuben Cortez Jr\n. facing Republican\nLaurie Turner\n. Libertarian\nLenard Nelson\nrounds out the pack. Incumbent\nMary Helen Berlanga\nof Corpus Christi didn't seek re-election.\n\u2022 SBOE-5 could be interesting, depending on the political climate in October. Perry got less than 54 percent, Obama was under 47 percent. The incumbent Republican is\nKen Mercer\n; challengers are Democrat\nRebecca Bell-Metereau\n, Libertarian\nMark Loewe\nand Green candidate\nIrene Meyer Scharf\n.\nSenate\n\u2022 All eyes are on Tarrant County's SD-10, where Democratic incumbent\nWendy Davis\nis being challenged by Rep.\nMark Shelton\n, R-Fort Worth. It's Republican on paper, but it's the same district that Davis won in 2008. Perry won here with 52.7 percent. Obama lost with 47.1 percent. The TWI is 11.5 on the Republican side, meaning that party's average statewide candidate won by that many percentage points over the last two cycles.\nHouse\n\u2022 Rep.\nCraig Eiland\n, D-Galveston, got a tough district from the mapmakers. Perry lost there, with 47.6 percent. But Obama lost, too, with 47.8 percent. Go figure. Republicans have the edge in statewide races, with a 2.3 TWI. The Republican here is\nWayne Faircloth\n.\n\u2022 The numbers in HD-34 marginally favor a Democrat, but the incumbent is Republican Rep.\nConnie Scott\nof Corpus Christi. The Democrat is former Rep.\nAbel Herrero\n.\n\u2022\u00a0HD-34 is a swing district, plain and simple. Your contestants are Rep.\nJ.M. Lozano\n, who was elected as a Democrat and then switched to the GOP, and former Rep.\nYvonne Gonzalez Toureilles\n.\n\u2022\u00a0Rep.\nDee Margo\n, R-El Paso, is another incumbent put on shaky ground by his own party's redistricting map. He's in a rematch with former Rep.\nJoe Moody\nin HD-78, where Obama won, Perry lost and the average Democrat beats the average Republican in statewide races. The almost good news for Margo: That average Democratic margin is a skinny 2.9 percentage points.\n\u2022 Dallas County's HD-107 pits Rep.\nKen Sheets\n, R-Dallas, against former Rep.\nRobert Miklos\n, D-Mesquite. It's got a Republican TWI and Obama lost in 2008, but Perry only won with 51 percent in 2010.\n\u2022 Redistricting wasn't kind to Rep.\nJohn V. Garza\n, R-San Antonio. He's defending HD-117 against Democrat\nPhilip Cortez\n, and it's a tossup district where Obama won and Perry lost.\n\u2022 HD-144, the district represented by the late\nKen Legler\nof Pasadena, is a true swing district where neither the current president nor the current governor could muster 50 percent of the vote. Democrat\nMary Ann Perez\nfaces Republican David Pineda and Libertarian\nRobb Rourke\n.\n\u2022\u00a0HD-114 is an open Dallas seat with former Rep.\nCarol Kent\n, a Democrat, against the GOP's\nJason Villalba\n. The numbers favor the Republican, and his backers are pulling hard to get a win for a Hispanic candidate. But Perry didn't win here in 2010, and the Democrats think they can win the seat back.\n\u2022 Houston's HD-134 is similar, with Republican numbers overall but a sub-par performance for Perry in 2010. Rep.\nSarah Davis\n, a freshman, is being challenged by Democrat\nAnn Johnson\n.\nTexas Tribune donors or members may be quoted or mentioned in our stories, or may be the subject of them.

Julián Castro, a Democrat from San Antonio, Texas, began his political career when he was elected to the San Antonio City Council in 2001. He first ran for mayor in 2005 but was defeated by Phil Hardberger, a fellow Democrat also from San Antonio. Despite the loss, Castro remained active in local politics and successfully ran for mayor again in 2009, this time winning the election and succeeding Hardberger. His victory marked the beginning of a prominent political trajectory that would later include serving as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama and running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.",

Each couple is scored by a panel of judges. The title of the show is a continuation of the long-running series\nCome Dancing\n. The format has been exported to 60 other countries under the title\nDancing with the Stars\n, licensed by BBC Worldwide, and led to a\nmodern dance\n-themed spin-off\nStrictly Dance Fever\n. The\nGuinness World Records\nnamed\nStrictly\nas the world's most successful reality television format in 2010.\n[\n8\n]\nThe series is currently presented by\nTess Daly\nand\nClaudia Winkleman\n.\nBruce Forsyth\nco-presented the series with Daly until 2013, returning for special episodes until November 2015.\nThe series has been broadcast on\nBBC One\nsince 15 May 2004, typically on Saturday evenings with a following Sunday night results show. From series 2 onwards, the show has been broadcast in the run up to Christmas.  With its high viewing figures,\nStrictly Come Dancing\nhas become a significant programme for dancing on British television.\n[\n9\n]\nEighteen stand-alone Christmas specials and nineteen charity specials have also been produced.\nDevelopment\n[\nedit\n]\nProducer\nRichard Hopkins\n, who had produced the first British series of\nBig Brother\n, unsuccessfully pitched the idea of a modern\nCome Dancing\nto the BBC under the title of\nPro-Celebrity Dancing\nin 2003.\n[\n10\n]\nLater, entertainment executive Fenia Vardanis also suggested reviving\nCome Dancing\n, so\nJane Lush\n, the then head of BBC Entertainment, put Hopkins and Vardanis together to develop the show.\n[\n10\n]\nHopkins then called in Karen Smith, who had just produced\nComic Relief Does Fame Academy\nfor BBC One and\nThe Games\nfor Channel 4, to help lead the development of the show and launch the series. Smith was the show-running Executive Producer of the first three series, and of sister show\nIt Takes Two\n.\n[\n11\n]\nShe then took the role of Creative Director of BBC Entertainment whilst still overseeing series 4 and 5.\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\nHopkins later took the format to America himself when the BBC dismissed the idea of selling it abroad, as they felt it was too British.\n[\n14\n]\nThe title is an amalgamation of the titles of the 1992 Australian film\nStrictly Ballroom\nand\nCome Dancing\n.\nFormat\n[\nedit\n]\nFrom series 1 to 11, Sir\nBruce Forsyth\nand\nTess Daly\npresented the pro-celebrity ballroom dancing competition. From series 8 to 11, Forsyth only presented the main show and was replaced for the results show by\nClaudia Winkleman\n, at which point Daly assumed Forsyth's role as main presenter and Winkleman assumed Daly's role as co-presenter. Winkleman joined Daly as full-time co-presenter for series 12 following Forsyth's departure after the 2013 series. Through\ntelephone voting\n, viewers vote for who they would like to be in the next round, the results of the poll being combined with the ranking of the judges. For example, with ten contestants left, the judges' favourite would receive ten points, second favourite nine points, and so on, and similarly with the viewers' rankings. The bottom ranked couple gets one point.\n[\n15\n]\nIn the event of tied scoring from the judges by two or more contestants, the couple immediately below them gets one point below them, until the bottom ranked couple on the leaderboard who ends up getting at least 2 points instead of one.\n[\n16\n]\nThe profits from the telephone lines were donated to\nSport Relief\nin series 1, to\nChildren in Need\nfrom series 2, until series 8 when donations to charity stopped.\nThe show is broadcast live on BBC One on Saturday evenings, and is currently presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman (with\nZoe Ball\ncovering for Winkleman for a number of weeks in 2014). Sir Bruce Forsyth presented the live shows alongside Daly from 2004 to 2013, announcing his departure in 2014. He was to continue to present special editions of the show.\n[\n17\n]\nFor most of the second series,\nNatasha Kaplinsky\nstood in temporarily for Daly while she took maternity leave; Claudia Winkleman hosted the results show and editions that Forsyth had missed between 2010 and 2013. The judging panel initially consisted of\nBruno Tonioli\n,\nArlene Phillips\n,\nLen Goodman\nand\nCraig Revel Horwood\n.\nAlesha Dixon\ntook Phillips' place from series 7 to 9, after which she left the programme to judge\nBritain's Got Talent\nwhich led retired ballerina\nDame Darcey Bussell\nto replace her.\n[\n18\n]\nGoodman left the show after the 2016 series and was replaced by\nShirley Ballas\n. Bussell remained as judge until 2018, and was replaced by\nMotsi Mabuse\nin 2019. Up until 2020, Tonioli commuted weekly between Hollywood and London to judge both the American and British versions of the show simultaneously - however, due the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, he could no longer juggle both the UK and US shows - he was not replaced for the 2020 series; but pro dancer\nAnton Du Beke\ntook his place from the 2021 series, and has now replaced Tonioli full-time on the panel. The current judging panel consists of Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Shirley Ballas and Anton Du Beke, making Horwood the only judge to remain with the programme since its inception. Each judge gives the performance a mark out of ten, giving an overall total out of forty. The voice-over announcer is\nAlan Dedicoat\n. During series four, an hour-long highlights show was shown on Sundays at 19:00 on BBC Two, and during series five and six, the results show moved to Sunday evenings, although it was filmed on Saturday and then broadcast \"as live\" on the Sunday.\nThe singers on the show are\nTommy Blaize\n,\nHayley Sanderson\n,\nLance Ellington\n, Andrea Grant and, formerly, the well-known British dance music vocalist\nTara McDonald\n. The music director is\nDavid Arch\n.\nTommy Blaize\nhas been part of\nStrictly\nsince its beginning. David Arch joined in the fourth series and Hayley Sanderson in the fifth. The original musical director from series 1 to 3 was\nLaurie Holloway\n. In the\nseventeenth series\n, the singers were joined by Mitchell.\n[\n19\n]\nThe show was broadcast from a specially constructed set at\nBBC Television Centre\n(primarily in the largest studio, TC1\n[\n20\n]\n) until its closure in 2013, with the show moving to\nElstree Studios\n' George Lucas Stage 2 from 2013 onwards. However, in the first two series, shows were also filmed at the\nTower Ballroom\nin\nBlackpool\n, where the original\nCome Dancing\nseries was filmed in the 1970s.\n[\n21\n]\n[\n22\n]\nIn the second series, two shows were filmed at the Tower Ballroom \u2013 show five and the Grand Final, which was broadcast live on 11 December 2004.\n[\n23\n]\n[\n24\n]\nIn 2005 though the BBC announced that they would not be returning to the venue for the third series due to \"logistical problems\".\n[\n25\n]\nIn October 2008, Craig Revel Horwood called for the series to return to the Tower Ballroom, saying, \"The atmosphere was electric. It's huge and has so much history. The Tower Ballroom puts a lot of pressure on the professionals and the celebrities to perform to the best of their potential.

It continued until series 7, but did not return in series 8. It was then reinstated in series 10 and has remained a feature of the show ever since.\nThe Dance-off consists of the two couples who received the lowest totals that week from the combined judges' scores and public vote. The aim of the dance-off is for the couples to convince the judges that they deserve to go through to the following week's competition. Before they attempt their dance a second time, the couples sometimes get advice from the judges. The judges then decide which couple remains in the competition based on the dance-off performances. If three of the judges agree that one of the couples should be saved, that couple is through to the following week's competition and the Head Judge's vote is not counted. If one couple has two votes and the other couple has one vote, then the deciding vote is cast by the head judge, originally\nLen Goodman\nand currently\nShirley Ballas\n. Afterwards, the eliminated couple perform one final dance \u2013 sometimes known as \"waltzing out of the ballroom\". The Monday after their elimination, they appear on\nIt Takes Two\nto discuss their time on the programme.\nOn two occasions, the dance-off was cancelled; firstly, in series 14, in which one of the celebrity contestants,\nAnastacia\n, sustained an injury and was unable to compete in the Dance-off as a result. Under the rules of the show, the couple with the lowest combined total was eliminated. The second occasion in which the Dance-off was cancelled was in Series 20, again due to an injury sustained by\nTony Adams\n. Tess Daly announced on the results show that Adams had decided to withdraw from the competition as a result of being unable to compete in the Dance-off.\nIt Takes Two\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nStrictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two\nDuring the run of\nStrictly Come Dancing\n,\nStrictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two\nis broadcast each weeknight on\nBBC Two\n. The series was previously hosted by Claudia Winkleman but, due to her pregnancy in 2011, she had to leave the series, and was replaced by Zoe Ball, who hosted the show from Series 9 to 18.\n[\n52\n]\nRylan Clark-Neal\njoined as co-host in series 17.

In the show, three couples remained in the competition. After all three had performed and the judges had given their scores, two of the couples were in joint-first position on the leaderboard, with\nTom Chambers\nand\nCamilla Dallerup\nin last place. This meant that, no matter how many public votes were cast in their favour, it was mathematically impossible for Chambers and Dallerup to avoid the dance-off. This oversight was initially unnoticed by producers until after the public vote became live and viewers were invited to call in and save their favourites at a cost of 15p per vote. Once the mistake was finally realised and the public vote was closed, it was announced that all three couples would be put through to the final, all the votes already cast would count towards the final result of the competition, and viewers could apply for a refund if they wished.\n[\n92\n]\nThe BBC received 1800 complaints about the incident,\n[\n93\n]\nwhile media regulator\nOfcom\nreceived 297.\n[\n92\n]\nJon Beazley, the BBC's Head of Entertainment Production, was interviewed on\nStrictly\n's spin-off show\nStrictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two\non 15 December. He apologised for the oversight, referring to it as an \"unprecedented situation\". On the same day, the BBC posted a statement on its website, which clarified that an independent adjudicator had been consulted to reach a solution that would offer \"fairness to the viewers who voted and the contestants themselves\".\n[\n94\n]\nThe BBC also stated that, following the mistake, \"the voting and judging mechanisms used in all BBC voting programmes [had] been thoroughly examined\".\n[\n92\n]\nAfter conducting an investigation, Ofcom concluded that \"the mistake had resulted from an oversight, rather than any shortcomings in the technical arrangements for voting or in the handling of votes received\", and that they were \"satisfied that appropriate steps were taken by the BBC and the disadvantage to viewers minimised\".

Evans denied the remark was sexual or directed at Manrara, explaining it was an inside joke nickname for fellow contestant\nJamie Borthwick\n, but nonetheless issued an apology and agreed to step back from his BBC radio show and the tour to focus on his wellbeing. The scandal was compounded by a separate incident involving a\nTikTok\n\"body language experiment\" with dance partner\nKatya Jones\n, which was misinterpreted and also prompted an apology.

"evidence": "The Book Thief is a historical fiction novel by the Australian author Markus Zusak, set in Nazi Germany during World War II. Published in 2005, The Book Thief became an international bestseller and was translated into 63 languages and sold 17 million copies. It was adapted into the 2013 feature film, The Book Thief.\n\nThe novel follows the adventures of a young girl, Liesel Meminger. Narrated by Death, the novel presents the lives and viewpoints of the many victims of the ongoing war. Themes throughout the story include death, literature, and love.\n\nPlot\nThe story begins in 1938 as Liesel Meminger, a nine-year-old girl, travels with her younger brother, Werner, on a train to their new foster home in Molching. Their mother, a Communist, can no longer care for them due to the rising dangers of the Nazi regime. Tragically, Werner dies during the journey, and Liesel, devastated, steals a book, The Gravedigger’s Handbook, from the train station. This act of theft marks the beginning of her connection to words and storytelling. She is unable to read but longs to learn.\n\nUpon arriving in Molching, Liesel is placed with her new foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann. Rosa is strict and harsh, often intimidating Liesel. Liesel finds comfort in her kindhearted foster father’s warmth and their bond, which grows through shared moments. Hans patiently helps Liesel as she struggles to learn to read, night after night when she awakens from nightmares.\n\nAs Liesel settles into her new home, she struggles with feelings of abandonment and guilt over her brother's death. Her friendship with the neighbor boy, Rudy Steiner, provides her with companionship and adventure. Rudy idolizes Jesse Owens, the African American Olympic runner, and the two engage in mischievous activities, including pranks and stealing food.\n\nLiesel's love for books deepens, leading her to steal more books to satiate her hunger for stories. When she brings the washing from her foster mother's job to the mayor's mansion, the mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann, shows Liesel an incredible library and allows her access to the books. But when the mayor and his wife fire Rosa, Liesel begins breaking into their house to steal books. Ilsa allows her to continue, leaving her gifts and a letter.\n\nThe narrative takes a dramatic turn when the Hubermanns decide to hide a Jewish man named Max Vandenburg in their basement. Max's father had saved Hans's life when they fought together in World War I. As Max becomes part of their household, he and Liesel form a close bond through their love of words and storytelling. Max makes a storybook titled The Standover Man as a gift for Liesel, illustrating his struggles.\n\nAs the war escalates, Liesel’s world is increasingly affected by the brutality of the Nazi regime. The Hubermanns risk their lives to protect Max. Liesel’s perspective on the world shifts as she becomes aware of the persecution of Jews and the impact of war on her community. Max has to leave the Hubermans' house after Hans shows a small act of kindness to a Jew who is being marched to a concentration camp, bringing Nazi suspicion down on the family. He is later captured by the Nazis, and Liesel sees him being marched to the same camp.\n\nThe tension culminates during a bombing raid on Molching, with tragic consequences. Liesel survives the attack, but the Hubermanns’ home is destroyed, and she loses her beloved foster parents, Hans and Rosa. Among the victims of the bombing is Rudy Steiner, Liesel’s best friend and confidant, whose death leaves her devastated. This profound loss leaves Liesel alone and grappling with overwhelming grief.\n\nAfter the bombing, Liesel is taken in by the mayor and his wife, where she begins to piece her life back together. In her new environment, she finds comfort in reading and writing, continuing to honor the memory of Hans, Rosa, and Rudy. The mayor's wife, Ilsa, recognizes Liesel's talent and passion for storytelling.\n\nAs the war comes to a close, Liesel’s experiences shape her understanding of the world. The final chapters reveal Liesel as an adult, reflecting on her life and the memories of those she lost during the war. She eventually emigrates to Australia, where she marries and raises a family, but her heart remains tied to her childhood and the people who shaped her.\n\nIn the conclusion, Death revisits Liesel's life, illustrating the impact of her story. He reflects on the enduring nature of human connections and the stories that shape our lives.",

It expanded to a wide release on November 27, 2013.\n[\n14\n]\n[\n15\n]\nReception\n[\nedit\n]\nCritical response\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Book Thief\nreceived mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregation website\nRotten Tomatoes\ngives the film a score of 50%, based on 149 reviews, with an average score of 5.80/10. The site's consensus states, \"A bit too safe in its handling of its Nazi Germany setting,\nThe Book Thief\ncounters its constraints with a respectful tone and strong performances.\"\n[\n16\n]\nOn\nMetacritic\n, the film has a score of 53 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n[\n17\n]\nIn her review for the\nNew Empress Magazine\n, Mair\u00e9ad Roche praised the film for providing a \"fresher perspective on the war\" through the experiences of ordinary Germans who lived through the Nazi era.\n[\n5\n]\nIn addition to the \"Oscar-baiting beautiful\" cinematography and John Williams's film score that contribute to the film's emotional appeal, Roche singled out the performance of young Sophie N\u00e9lisse as Liesel that \"matches the well-measured and seemingly effortless efforts of both Rush and Watson\".\n[\n5\n]\nRoche concluded,\nThe Book Thief\nweaves a consistent thread of humanity through its narrative via the commonality of Death, storytelling, and the concept of free will. The disturbing sight of children in Hitler Youth uniforms and Allied blanket bombing, when shown through the innocence of a child, humanises the German generation just living their lives without the hindsight of history. A blurring of vision due to tears is to be expected, but that effect is delivered with respect and dignity to the audience.\n[\n5\n]\nIn his review following the\nMill Valley Film Festival\n, Dennis Harvey at\nVariety\nmagazine wrote, \"Rush generously provides the movie's primary warmth and humor; Watson is pitch-perfect as a seemingly humorless scold with a well-buried soft side.\"\n[\n18\n]\nHarvey also praised the film's cinematography and film score, noting that \"impeccable design contributions are highlighted by Florian Ballhaus'[s] somber but handsome widescreen lensing and an excellent score by John Williams that reps his first feature work for a director other than Steven Spielberg in years.\"\n[\n18\n]\nStephanie Merry of\nThe Washington Post\nwas less impressed with the film, giving it two and half out of four stars. Merry felt that the film \"has its moments of brilliance, thanks in large part to an adept cast\" but that the film ultimately shows the difficulties of bringing a successful novel to the screen.\n[\n19\n]\nIn his review for the\nLos Angeles Times\n, Robert Abele was also unimpressed, describing the film as \"just another tasteful, staid Hollywoodization of terribleness, in which a catastrophic time acts as a convenient backdrop for a wishful narrative rather than the springboard for an honest one\".\n[\n6\n]\nAccolades\n[\nedit\n]\nAward\nCategory\nNominee\nResult\nAACTA International Awards\n[\n20\n]\nBest Supporting Actor\nGeoffrey Rush\nNominated\nAcademy Awards\n[\n21\n]\nBest Original Score\nJohn Williams\nNominated\nBritish Academy Film Awards\n[\n22\n]\nBest Film Music\nNominated\nCritics' Choice Movie Awards\nBest Young Actor/Actress\nSophie N\u00e9lisse\nNominated\nGolden Globe Awards\n[\n23\n]\nBest Original Score\nJohn Williams\nNominated\nGrammy Awards\nBest Instrumental Composition\nJohn Williams\nWon\nHollywood Film Awards\nSpotlight\nSophie N\u00e9lisse\nWon\nPhoenix Film Critics Society\nBest Performance by a Youth in a Lead or Supporting Role \u2013 Female\nWon\nSatellite Awards\nBest Supporting Actress\nEmily Watson\nNominated\nBest Original Score\nJohn Williams\nNominated\nNewcomer\nSophie N\u00e9lisse\nWon\nYoung Artist Awards\n[\n24\n]\nBest Leading Young Actress in a Feature Film\nWon\nHome media\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Book Thief\nwas released on\nBlu-ray\nand\nDVD\non March 11, 2014.\n[\n7\n]\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\n\"John Williams to Score 'The Book Thief'\n\"\n.

    "evidence": "Cover to Reel: THE BOOK THIEF \u2013 BookPeople\nSkip to content\nbookpeopleatx\nUncategorized\nMarch 19, 2014\nMarch 19, 2014\n~ post by Katie G\nCover to Reel is a regular column in which I offer my two cents about that age-old debate of whether or not a movie did any kind of justice to the book it\u2019s based on.\nI am a visual person. So, the reason why I appreciate movie adaptations is that it always brings the story into focus. With my last two posts, (\nMonuments Men\n&\nBlue is the Warmest Color\n), I was beginning to worry my little project here wasn\u2019t ever going to have anything nice to say. Thankfully, I needn\u2019t have worried.\nThis was my first read of\nThe Book Thief\nby Markus Zusak\n. I have to say it changed my life. It\u2019s this weird & wonderful, exceptionally well written novel. I loved every minute of Liesel Meminger\u2019s life among her cast of eccentric, playful and wholly lovable characters.\nNarrated by Death, we see a little girl\u2019s adolescence filled with war, loss, & words through his ethereal perspective. The living confuse & fascinate him, especially subjects like the precocious Liesel who\u2019s taken in by the Hubermanns, Hans & Rosa, of Himmel (Heaven) street, following the death of her brother & her Communist mother\u2019s decision to give her up. She soon makes friends. First, there\u2019s her partner in crime & almost kisses, Rudy Steiner. Second, there\u2019s Max Vanderburg, a Jew whose life is tied to Hans Hubermann\u2019s. He\u2019s brought into their home and hidden from the Nazis. Max & Liesel work through the strife this war is causing them together and form a bond over the beautiful stories that Max creates for her reading lessons. Keep your tissues out the closer you get to the end.\nI am often fascinated by how people tick. Markus Zusak is someone I would love to spend a golden afternoon with.\nThis book is near perfection. It handles big, overwhelming themes with what can only be described as grace. Each page comes alive with playful, bold images. It\u2019s dark, thought provoking & visceral.\nThe book is labeled \u201cyoung adult,\u201d but anyone can read this story and gain something. Liesel & her band of misfits will make your heart smile.\nThe movie, keeping the same title, came out on video Tuesday. It\u2019s directed by Brian Percival (\nDownton Abbey\n) with a screenplay written by Michael Petroni (\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\n). Both these film makers are relatively green in their resumes, and it shows from time to time, but they made a great family film. And, they made a good book to movie adaptation.\nWhere the filmmakers might have been lacking, the cast more than picks up the slack. Geoffery Rush (\nThe King\u2019s Speech\n) as Hans Hubermann is a no-brainer. I knew the make-up of the cast while I was reading the book, and it just clicked. Rudy (Nico Liersch) & Max\u2019s (Ben Schnetzer) players are perfect. The two main women were the ones I was the most fond of & surprised by. Emily Watson (\nRed Dragon\n,\nPunch Drunk Love\n) has always been a favorite of mine. It wasn\u2019t too surprising that she was able to embody Rosa Hubermann. Rosa is a woman who, superficially, appears to be harsh & far too logical to balance Hans\u2019 romantic nature. But, deep down, she has just as big of a heart. Watson captures this completely.\nAll of them are lovely, but my favorite has to be Sophie N\u00e9lisse as Liesel.\u00a0N\u00e9lisse is a relatively unknown (at least to American audiences), French Canadian, 13 year old actress. She is beautiful, poised and just great. Her accent was perfect (I\u2019m not German; to my Texan ears, it\u2019s perfect) and she carries the film on her shoulders with ease. I have to think Liesel would be proud of her film counterpart. I\u2019d keep an eye on Miss N\u00e9lisse\u2019s film career down the road.\nThe movie keeps all the essential elements from the book. Death is still narrating. Liesel\u2019s life plays out with heaping handfuls of tragedy between the few truly happy moments, most of which she has to steal for herself. The movie is a great family film.\nI put an emphasis on family film, again, to soften my one major critique of the movie.\nHollywood loves family films, especially ones released during the holidays \u2014 the\u00a0theatrical release of\nThe Book Thief\nwas in November. They tend to use a specific set of rules for family films, and that conformity is its only fault. The rules, as I see them, mean the movie can\u2019t be too dark & it can\u2019t fall into too much moral ambiguity, both of which are prominent in the pages of Zusak\u2019s\nThe Book Thief\n.\nI can forgive the film\u2019s use of these rules to a degree. My strongest contention is one I am not willing to forgive. On more than one occasion in the movie, Liesel rejects the idea she is stealing books. She defensively spits out at the boy playing Rudy that she \u201cborrows\u201d books and does not steal them. This, even though, we never actually see her return a single book in the film.\nI know. It sounds weird. But, Zusak titled the novel\nThe Book Thief\nfor a reason. The Liesel Meminger of his story embraces the thrill of stealing books because it\u2019s not just about thievery \u2013 it\u2019s about retribution. Liesel has had so much stolen from her (family, her childhood, her country) that it\u2019s a form of justice; saving that which the Nazi\u2019s abuse, destroy, but also manipulate to their advantage \u2013 words.\nWords are powerful, and Liesel is stealing them back to revive her small corner of humanity.\nSo, I feel like it sacrificed something essential to the heart of Liesel (and really any child going through something so horrific) solely for the sake of letting us know what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong.\nI will stand by the movie. I do wish it had kept more of the novel\u2019s dark tone, but it told the version of the story it wanted to tell \u2013 and it was told well. But, very few things can compare to the beautiful images that Zusak created.\nThe Book Thief\nshould be required reading for all.\n_______________________________________________________________\nThe Book Thief\nis available on our shelves and online via\nbookpeople.com\n.\nThe film is available for rent at both Vulcan Video locations here in town.\nShare this:\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\nTumblr\nClick to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\nPinterest\nMore\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nReddit\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn\nClick to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\nPocket\nClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nEmail\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\nPrint\nLike\nLoading...\nRelated\nTagged\naustin\nbook to movie\nBookPeople\nfilm adaptation\nmarkus zusak\ntexas\nthe book thief\nPublished by\nbookpeopleatx\nBooks and socks!\nView all posts by bookpeopleatx\nPublished\nMarch 19, 2014\nMarch 19, 2014\n16 thoughts on \u201c\nCover to Reel: THE BOOK\u00a0THIEF\n\u201d\nI typically am greatly disappointed by movie adaptations of books, especially those I hold dear to my heart, but I was very happy with this one. I think my biggest issue with the movie was them having Rosa suggest turning Max in, I don\u2019t remember her doing this in the book. I felt it went against the character Zusak wrote for her: the woman with a heart of gold who pretends to be tough.\nI truly enjoyed your review!\nReply\nThank you! It\u2019s always hard to let go of the expectations surrounding an important book.\nIt\u2019s funny. I ended up watching this movie twice before finishing my review. At first, I was shocked by movie Rosa having that response. The second time, I ruminated and it hit me. While she may never have had that specific reaction in the book, I think it speaks to Rosa. They\u2019re taking a significant risk in taking in Max. Rosa is nothing if not practical, and she wanted to protect her family. I think that\u2019s the feeling they were trying to express in that scene, and it fits. She\u2019s still the one to sit there and spoon feed Max, after all.\nReply\nThe Books Thief is indeed an amazing book and I loved it from the first page. I haven\u2019t seen the movie yet, but I am really looking forward to. I am going to watch it in my mother tongue, which is german. As it is as well the language of the time and the place of the story, I think it\u2019ll be quite good. And being honest I am a bit sceptical about the german accent the actors use. It is a little overacted, in my opinion.\nBut anyway, I can\u2019t wait to see the movie \ud83d\ude42\nAnd this is a great review so hat off \ud83d\ude42\nYours\nSmarty\nReply\nThank you! I will say it was one of my favorite parts of the book and pleasant to see within the movie, as well. I love the mix of German language inside the book. It\u2019s like a little mini German lesson.\nReply\nGreat review. I agree with all of it \u2013 I too was disappointed that she kept denying that she was stealing the books. As you say, that was integral to the story. I was in pieces after reading the book and happily, I felt the same emotions at the end of the movie. I also loved Rudy \u2013 his angel face, his hijinx \u2013 I thought the actor did an incredible job bringing him to life.\nReply\nThank you! There\u2019s an interview that Zusak did about the movie that I almost included in this post.\nhttp://www.hypable.com/2013/11/07/the-book-thief-movie-markus-zusak-interview/\nIn it, he talks about how Rudy was his favorite character and how he really enjoyed seeing him in action.\nReply\nI had a few issues with this film, my biggest being her last scene with Rudy as I mentioned in my review but I thought as adaptations go this was a pretty decent one. I\u2019d read all these terrible reviews and when I saw the film it was clear that a lot of film critics had never cracked the spine of the original version.\nReply\nYeah, I can completely understand. For me, it wasn\u2019t that upsetting. They had altered so much of the Rudy/Liesel storyline that it just didn\u2019t bother me at that point. They were playing up the connection between the two because they had less space to make it significant while still being able to empathize with the other strong relationships in her life.\nReply\nJust started reading this book (it was about time) and I already love it! I am generally disappointed by movie adaptations (I think the Lovely Bones was the worst!), but I enjoyed your review and will definitely be watching the movie in this case! \ud83d\ude42\nReply\nThank you! You will continue to love it, I swear!\nReply\nOne of the best books I\u2019ve ever read.  I haven\u2019t seen the movie yet.  Thanks for the review!\nReply\nThank you!\nReply\nGreat post! I loved, loved, looooved this book and it holds a permanent place in my heart. Rudy was also my favorite character, and it was disappointing to me to see how little camera time he got in the movie. The actor playing him was PERFECT, I just wish there had been more of that sweet, lovely, childish connection between him and Liesel. That is the one thing I did not like about the movie\u2026 it needed more Rudy.\nReply\nRudy is the best, isn\u2019t he? I guess I always appreciated the relationship between her and Max more as I read, so I was more satisfied with the amount of screen time for both.\nReply\nReblogged this on\nStephen Does\n.\nReply\nThanks for sharing , Nice Website!

    "evidence": "Moon Jae-in (Korean: 문재인, pronounced [mun.dʑɛ.in] ⓘ; born 24 January 1953) is a South Korean politician and former lawyer who served as the 12th president of South Korea from 2017 to 2022. Before his presidency, he served as the senior secretary for civil affairs and the chief of staff to President Roh Moo-hyun,[3] a member of the National Assembly, and the leader of the Democratic Party of Korea. Born to North Korean refugees, Moon was raised in poverty in Busan.[4] He excelled in school and studied law at Kyung Hee University. He became a lawyer and was involved in human rights activism with Roh Moo-hyun. He was imprisoned for organizing a protest against the Yushin Constitution. As a result of his work in human rights law, Moon was chosen to be Roh's campaign manager in the 2002 presidential election.[5] He served in Roh's administration in various official capacities. In 2012, Moon was a candidate for the Democratic United Party in the 2012 presidential election, which he lost to Park Geun-hye, in which Park was aided by the National Intelligence Service (NIS).[6] In the 2017 presidential election, Moon was elected president as the Democratic Party of Korea candidate after Park Geun-hye was impeached and removed from office.[7][8] As president, Moon received international attention for his meetings with North Korean Chairman Kim Jong Un at inter-Korean summits in April, May, and September 2018, making him the third South Korean president to meet their North Korean counterpart. On June 30, 2019, he met with both Kim and US president Donald Trump at the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). During his presidency. Moon favored the Sunshine Policy, a peaceful approach to Korean reunification.[9] On economic policy, he favored reform of chaebols (conglomerates),[10] raised the minimum wage by more than 16%,[11] and lowered the maximum workweek from 68 to 52 hours.[12] During the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, Moon received praise domestically and internationally.[13] His party won a historic victory in the 2020 South Korean legislative election.[14] However, his party lost the next presidential election, making him the first president since South Korea's democratization in 1987 to transfer power to the opposition after a single term. He left office in May 2022, succeeded by his former prosecutor general, Yoon Suk Yeol. Early life, education, and military service Moon Jae-in was born in Geoje, South Korea, on January 24, 1953, shortly before the end of the Korean War, as the second child and oldest son among five children of father Moon Yong-hyung and mother Kang Han-ok. His parents were refugees from South Hamgyong Province, North Korea who fled their native city of Hungnam in the Hungnam evacuation during the Korean War.[15] His father worked as head of the agriculture department that detained food, especially the rice of Korean colonial people, as one of the main tasks in Heungnam, Hamju, South Hamgyong Province.[16][17] His family eventually settled in Busan. Since his father did not want to become a government employee as he had been in North Korea, he started a business selling socks, which left his family in great debt. His mother became the main earner by selling clothes received from relief organizations and delivering briquettes. Moon's family became attached to the Catholic Church when his mother went to the local cathedral to receive whole milk powder. Moon once said in an interview that he did not know how to ride a bike since his family was too poor to afford a bike or a monthly school tuition.[18] Moon entered Kyungnam High School and reportedly placed at the top of his class.[15][19] He was accepted to study law at Kyung Hee University with a full scholarship.[20] At university, he met his future wife, Kim Jung-sook. After organizing a student protest against the Yushin Constitution, he was arrested, convicted, imprisoned at Seodaemun Prison, and expelled from the university.[15][21][22] Later, he was conscripted into the military and assigned to the 1st Special Forces Brigade, where he participated in \"Operation Paul Bunyan\" during the axe murder incident in Panmunjom.[23][24] After his honorable discharge, the death of his father motivated him to study for the bar exam. He stayed at the Buddhist temple of Daeheungsa to study for the exam and passed the first of two rounds in 1979. In 1980, he returned to Kyung Hee University to complete the remainder of his studies. Later that year, he passed the second round of the bar exam and was admitted to the Judicial Research and Training Institute. He graduated from the Institute ranked second in his class but was not appointed a judge or prosecutor due to his history of student activism against the Yushin dictatorship under Park Chung Hee.[25] Moon then chose to go into private practice instead. Moon was considered the frontrunner to win Korea's 2017 presidential election, which would be the 19th term of the country's presidency, following the impeachment and removal of Park Geun-hye. The election had originally been scheduled for December 2017, but was brought forward to May 2017 in order to ensure that they would take place within 60 days of Park's removal, as required by the Constitution. He won the Democratic Party's nomination against fellow party members Ahn Hee-jung, Lee Jae-myung, and Choi Sung with 57% of the votes. The general election originally had 15 announced candidates. Moon faced four other major party nominees during the election, including 2012 presidential rival and past party colleague Ahn Cheol-soo of the People's Party and Hong Jun-pyo of the Liberty Korea Party. He was elected the 19th president of South Korea in Korea's 19th presidential election by a large plurality over two. On May 10, 2017, Moon won the election with a plurality of 41.1% votes (out of 13,423,800 votes nationwide).[36] As Moon was elected in a special election, he did not have the usual 60-day transition period of previous administrations but was instead inaugurated the day after the election. Euh Yoon-Dae (Korean: 어윤대; born 22 May 1945) is a South Korean professor, financier, and advisor for the South Korean government.

    "evidence": "Moon Jae-in (Korean: 문재인, pronounced [mun.dʑɛ.in] ⓘ; born 24 January 1953) is a South Korean politician and former lawyer who served as the 12th president of South Korea from 2017 to 2022. Before his presidency, he served as the senior secretary for civil affairs and the chief of staff to President Roh Moo-hyun,[3] a member of the National Assembly, and the leader of the Democratic Party of Korea. Born to North Korean refugees, Moon was raised in poverty in Busan.[4] He excelled in school and studied law at Kyung Hee University. He became a lawyer and was involved in human rights activism with Roh Moo-hyun. He was imprisoned for organizing a protest against the Yushin Constitution. As a result of his work in human rights law, Moon was chosen to be Roh's campaign manager in the 2002 presidential election.[5] He served in Roh's administration in various official capacities. In 2012, Moon was a candidate for the Democratic United Party in the 2012 presidential election, which he lost to Park Geun-hye, in which Park was aided by the National Intelligence Service (NIS).[6] In the 2017 presidential election, Moon was elected president as the Democratic Party of Korea candidate after Park Geun-hye was impeached and removed from office.[7][8] As president, Moon received international attention for his meetings with North Korean Chairman Kim Jong Un at inter-Korean summits in April, May, and September 2018, making him the third South Korean president to meet their North Korean counterpart. On June 30, 2019, he met with both Kim and US president Donald Trump at the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). During his presidency. Moon favored the Sunshine Policy, a peaceful approach to Korean reunification.[9] On economic policy, he favored reform of chaebols (conglomerates),[10] raised the minimum wage by more than 16%,[11] and lowered the maximum workweek from 68 to 52 hours.[12] During the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, Moon received praise domestically and internationally.[13] His party won a historic victory in the 2020 South Korean legislative election.[14] However, his party lost the next presidential election, making him the first president since South Korea's democratization in 1987 to transfer power to the opposition after a single term. He left office in May 2022, succeeded by his former prosecutor general, Yoon Suk Yeol. Early life, education, and military service Moon Jae-in was born in Geoje, South Korea, on January 24, 1953, shortly before the end of the Korean War, as the second child and oldest son among five children of father Moon Yong-hyung and mother Kang Han-ok. His parents were refugees from South Hamgyong Province, North Korea who fled their native city of Hungnam in the Hungnam evacuation during the Korean War.[15] His father worked as head of the agriculture department that detained food, especially the rice of Korean colonial people, as one of the main tasks in Heungnam, Hamju, South Hamgyong Province.[16][17] His family eventually settled in Busan. Since his father did not want to become a government employee as he had been in North Korea, he started a business selling socks, which left his family in great debt. His mother became the main earner by selling clothes received from relief organizations and delivering briquettes. Moon's family became attached to the Catholic Church when his mother went to the local cathedral to receive whole milk powder. Moon once said in an interview that he did not know how to ride a bike since his family was too poor to afford a bike or a monthly school tuition.[18] Moon entered Kyungnam High School and reportedly placed at the top of his class.[15][19] He was accepted to study law at Kyung Hee University with a full scholarship.[20] At university, he met his future wife, Kim Jung-sook. After organizing a student protest against the Yushin Constitution, he was arrested, convicted, imprisoned at Seodaemun Prison, and expelled from the university.[15][21][22] Later, he was conscripted into the military and assigned to the 1st Special Forces Brigade, where he participated in \"Operation Paul Bunyan\" during the axe murder incident in Panmunjom.[23][24] After his honorable discharge, the death of his father motivated him to study for the bar exam. He stayed at the Buddhist temple of Daeheungsa to study for the exam and passed the first of two rounds in 1979. In 1980, he returned to Kyung Hee University to complete the remainder of his studies. Later that year, he passed the second round of the bar exam and was admitted to the Judicial Research and Training Institute. He graduated from the Institute ranked second in his class but was not appointed a judge or prosecutor due to his history of student activism against the Yushin dictatorship under Park Chung Hee.[25] Moon then chose to go into private practice instead. Moon was considered the frontrunner to win Korea's 2017 presidential election, which would be the 19th term of the country's presidency, following the impeachment and removal of Park Geun-hye. The election had originally been scheduled for December 2017, but was brought forward to May 2017 in order to ensure that they would take place within 60 days of Park's removal, as required by the Constitution. He won the Democratic Party's nomination against fellow party members Ahn Hee-jung, Lee Jae-myung, and Choi Sung with 57% of the votes. The general election originally had 15 announced candidates. Moon faced four other major party nominees during the election, including 2012 presidential rival and past party colleague Ahn Cheol-soo of the People's Party and Hong Jun-pyo of the Liberty Korea Party. He was elected the 19th president of South Korea in Korea's 19th presidential election by a large plurality over two. On May 10, 2017, Moon won the election with a plurality of 41.1% votes (out of 13,423,800 votes nationwide).[36] As Moon was elected in a special election, he did not have the usual 60-day transition period of previous administrations but was instead inaugurated the day after the election.

She rose to prominence as a teen idol, and transitioned into a leading pop artist due to her versatility across music styles and visual presentation. Due to her career reinventions and longevity, she is known as an icon across Japan and Asia.[1][2][3][4] She has been referred to as the \\\"Queen of Japanese Pop\\\", and her influence domestically has drawn equivalent comparisons to artists such as Janet Jackson and Madonna in Western pop culture.[5][6][7][8] Born in Naha, Okinawa, Amuro debuted as the lead singer of the idol group Super Monkey's in 1992 when she was 14 years old. Despite early sales disappointments, Amuro's rising popularity helped to score a major hit with the 1995 Eurobeat single \\\"Try Me (Watashi o Shinjite)\\\".[9][10][11] Signing to Avex Trax for her solo career, Amuro catapulted to fame with a string of number one singles including \\\"Chase the Chance\\\" and \\\"Don't Wanna Cry\\\". A close partnership with renowned producer Tetsuya Komuro resulted in a dance-pop sound with Western influences. Her first four releases, including Sweet 19 Blues (1996) and Concentration 20 (1997), each received multi-million certifications. Her 1997 single \\\"Can You Celebrate?\\\" remains as the best selling single by a solo female artist in Japanese music history.[12][13][14] In the early 2000s, \\\"Never End\\\" became Amuro's last successful single before a decline in sales, and her music began evolving from pop to R&B as she reined in creative control of her career. This transition was marked by the Suite Chic project in 2002 and her sixth studio album Style (2003). Amuro's eighth studio album, Play (2007), with the hit single \\\"Baby Don't Cry\\\", began a period of commercial resurgence. Her comeback was solidified with the 2008 single \\\"60s 70s 80s\\\" and its parent release Best Fiction. She continued to experiment musically in the 2010s, dabbling in EDM and recording in English, beginning with her tenth studio album Uncontrolled (2012). It featured the million-certified single \\\"Love Story\\\". She later founded her own management company, Stella88, and record label, Dimension Point. Amuro finished her career with the 2017 greatest hits album Finally, which became the best selling album of the decade and made her the only artist to achieve a million-seller in each of their teens, 20s, 30s and 40s.[15] She officially retired from the music industry on September 16, 2018. As it coincided with the closure of the Heisei era (1989–2019), she became labelled as the representative \\\"Heisei diva\\\" with many calling it the \\\"end of an era\\\", in both senses.[16][17] Having sold more than 40 million records, Amuro is recognized as one of the best-selling artists in Japan by Oricon.[18] She has received accolades from the Japan Record Awards, Japan Gold Disc Awards, MTV Video Music Awards Japan and the World Music Awards. Amuro released her second compilation album, Love Enhanced Single Collection, on March 13, 2002.[84] The album reworked nearly every single released after her return from hiatus in 1998, with new vocals, mixes or rearrangements.[85] The single \\\"I Will\\\" was released a month before the album and became Amuro's first single below 100,000 units in sales.[18] Although the album was moderately successful, peaking at number three and shifting over 300,000 units, it only sold a fraction of its predecessor 181920 (1998).[86] In July 2002, Amuro divorced Maruyama, and legally changed her name back to Namie Amuro, having cited irreconcilable differences. According to reports, her divorce was due to her personal issues with Maruyama's family.[87] Retrospectively, The Times attributed her loss in popularity during this era to the attention surrounding her personal struggles, while The Japan Times cited the rise of newer artists Hikaru Utada and Ayumi Hamasaki, who achieved great success in the wake of her hiatus.[88][89] In a 2005 interview, Amuro said: \\\"Even my closest friend said I was finished, but I think I may be a little different from the others. My popularity plunged three years ago and I didn’t try to court publicity. It was a real challenge forcing myself to be consistent in not playing up to my fans.\\\"[88] Amuro started work on her sixth studio and third collaboration album with Dallas Austin, releasing Diane Warren-written single \\\"Wishing on the Same Star\\\" on September 11, 2002.[90] The single saw a large slip in Amuro's sales, only shifting 95,000 units by the end of the year.[18] In December 2002, Amuro was part of the musical project Suite Chic, involving several Japanese artists like Verbal, Zeebra, Dabo and DJ Muro.[91] The project released two singles, one studio album and one remix album before dissolution in 2003.[92][93][94] Amuro returned to solo activities in mid-2003, releasing the singles \\\"Shine More\\\", \\\"Put 'Em Up\\\", and the double A-side singles: \\\"So Crazy\\\" and \\\"Come\\\". The single's saw an exploration of westernised musical styles with American producers, including R&B producers Full Force and the work of Austin.[95] \\\"Come\\\" was used for the Japanese anime InuYasha,[96] and is a re-arranged song that was originally recorded by Australian recording artist and TV personality Sophie Monk.[97] At the end of the year, she released her sixth studio album and first album in three years, Style.[98] The album became her lowest chart album on the Oricon Albums Chart, peaking at number four. It is also her lowest selling studio album, shifting only 222,000 units in that region.[99] To promote the studio album, Amuro conducted her So Crazy Tour Featuring Best Singles on November 29.[100] The tour concluded in Japan on April 11, 2004.[101] She extended the concert tour, marked as a promotional appearance, in Taiwan,[102] and South Korea.[103] Shortly after the tour, she released the single \\\"All for You\\\" on July 22, 2004, confirming work on her seventh studio album.[104] This was followed by the double A-side single \\\"Girl Talk\\\" and \\\"Girl Talk/The Speed Star\\\", released on October 14, 2004.[105] It was successful in Japan, peaking at number two, and sold over 107,000 units in that region; it became her first top three single in two years.[106] Amuro decided not to appear on 55th Kōhaku Uta Gassen, although she had been invited to perform at the event.[107] She had previously attended the event nine years in a row.",

Legend of Crimson\n,\n[\n73\n]\n[\n74\n]\nand \"Luv U\" was created and choreographed from the scene heart-finger V by the animation\nSugar Sugar Rune\n.\n[\n75\n]\n\"\nDumdi Dumdi\n\" was inspired by the 2016\nDisney\n's\nZootopia\n.\n[\n76\n]\nThe inspiration for \"\nHwaa\n\" came to Soyeon when Shuhua once said 'winter girl' in a conversation. She took the idea and created the concept of a woman trapped in winter.\n[\n77\n]\nFor\nI Never Die\n, Soyeon compared the album with the\nMarineford war\nin\nOne Piece\nanime series \u2013 \"the war is a very important event in\nOne Piece\n. The story revolves around the members who have grown up two years after fighting a war that they thought was an insurmountable crisis and like the members are separated to grow up. Like the manga, I thought\nI Never Die\nis an album that depicts (G)I-dle after the war. This album, which is represented by growth and shock, was perfected with passion and fierceness.\"\n[\n78\n]\n\"\nTomboy\n\" was inspired by the fictional character,\nCruella de Vil\n.\n[\n79\n]\n\"If we had done music that taught and gave lessons before, this time we wanted to express the songs [message] with a light and\ncomical\npoint along with the\nmotif\nof the movie\nI Feel Pretty\n.\n\u2014\nSoyeon\nexplaining the art direction of the album,\nElectronic Times\n.\n[\n80\n]\nBefore the release of\nI Love\n, Soyeon appeared in episode 445 of\nI Live Alone\nwhere she was seen leading a meeting for the next album in which she said \"I have a message I want to convey,\" that \"It's better to be hated as I am than to be loved as I am not.\" She stated that she was inspired by late actress\nMarilyn Monroe\nfor the next album concept. \"I want to break the prejudice of 'sexy'. You can think of it as a\nmetaphorical\nexpression that 'even if I am loved by you again, I will (still) be me',\" she added.\n[\n81\n]\nSoyeon noted in the press release for the album\nI Feel\n, that she was inspired by the 2018 movie\nI Feel Pretty\nand the subject revolves around conveying a message about\nself-esteem\nand\nconfidence\n.\n[\n80\n]\nSongwriting and musical style\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nI-dle \u00a7\u00a0Musical style\nFor Soyeon's music credits, see\nList of songs written and produced by Soyeon\n.\nAlthough Soyeon trained in songwriting classes before her debut, she never intended to be (G)I-dle's primary songwriter. Instead, she took on the role out of necessity: \"At first, I really didn't know I'd be writing these songs ... but our debut was getting delayed because we didn't have a song. So that's when I thought, I should write our song, and started writing a title track.\"\n[\n63\n]\nShe described her composition process as starting with writing melodies on a blank page with just a piano or a beat, noting that \"it is common to have a track maker, someone who writes melodies and putting a melody on a mostly completed beat.\" In the production of the group's debut song \"Latata\", Soyeon began with\nmoombahton\nbeats and simple instruments such as percussion, putting them on loop and coated them with melody. She considers her bandmates while writing and tries to avoid the lyrics involving \"me\" or \"I\".\n[\n64\n]\nSoyeon further emphasized the importance of appealing to emotions to \"mak[e] music without prejudice ... I think it's the music that anyone can sympathize with. Our group is multinational and has no language barrier.\"\n[\n82\n]\nFor (G)I-dle's first preliminary performance on the competition show\nQueendom\n, Soyeon proposed a sorceress concept for \"Latata\", an arrangement that\nIZM\npraised as \"an entirely original song\". According to the magazine, her consistent confidence in her group, song and herself both on and offstage is because \"she has a clear image of what she wants to create.\"\n[\n83\n]\n[\n84\n]\n[\n85\n]\nPoet Seo Hyo-in wrote that Soyeon \"covers all aspects of producing, from composition and writing, rap making and setting the concept\" but \"doesn't overshadow the other members.\" She praised Soyeon for maximizing the strengths of each member, allowing them to find their own artistic freedom.\n[\n86\n]\nGender stereotypes in music\n[\nedit\n]\n\"All stereotypes must be crushed. The stereotype that you're too young to do something. The stereotype that limits female idols. Music has no gender.\"\n\u2014Soyeon, 2019\n[\n67\n]\nSoyeon expressed her desire for more women to take part in record production,\n[\n87\n]\nbelieving that there are no gender boundaries when it comes to arts forms like music, performances and gaming.\n[\n88\n]\nShe stated, \"When I write, I don't think about gender. No 'we're a girl group', women, men or age. I just write what's on my mind.\"\n[\n89\n]\nIn June 2020 interview with\nMTV\n, on using the pronoun \"she\" in \"\nOh My God\n\", Soyeon remarked that she \"didn't want to limit that 'she' to a certain being or a certain definition, so it's open to anything\" and that \"all kinds of love are valuable and must be respected.\"\n[\n90\n]\nImage and impact\n[\nedit\n]\nMedia outlets have labelled Soyeon a versatile artist, \"triple threat\", and\nAlpha girl\ndue to her success as a rapper, singer, and songwriter and skills in record production and dancing.\n[\n6\n]\n[\n91\n]\nCube Entertainment noted that Soyeon's presence in (G)I-dle was vital to the group's popularity and helped set them apart from their peers.\n[\n92\n]\nAlso nicknamed \"survival born monster\", stemming from her appearance on multiple survival shows, she has established herself as a next-generation \"producer-dol\".\n[\n93\n]\n[\n94\n]\nRBW\n's Cosmic Sound (Kim Ki-hyun) and Cosmic Girl (former\nRania\nmember Yoo Joo-yi) described Soyeon as a \"genius songwriter-idol\",\n[\n95\n]\nand\nKukinews\nnamed her the first successful female\nKorean idol\nsinger who also produces music for both her group and other artists.\n[\n96\n]\nJournalist Park Eun-hae dubbed Soyeon the Korean\nLady Gaga\ndue to her small figure; courage to try challenging concepts without genre limitations; and unique position in the Korean entertainment industry as a writer, producer, and performer.\n[\n97\n]\nSoyeon has been regarded as a role model for young women.\n[\n98\n]\nVarious artists cited her as an inspiration, including Majors' Aki,\n[\n99\n]\nANS' Dalyn,\n[\n100\n]\nWoo!ah!\n's Songyee,\n[\n101\n]\nCraxy's KaRin\n[\n102\n]\nLightsum\n's Jian and Juhyeon,\n[\n103\n]\n[\n104\n]\nLunarsolar\n's Eseo,\n[\n105\n]\nH1-Key\n's Hwiseo,\n[\n106\n]\nBlank2y\n's Siwoo,\n[\n107\n]\nand Adya's Sena,\n[\n108\n]\nPurple Kiss\n' Yuki.\n[\n109\n]\nSouth Korean producer and songwriter\nRyan S.

I was very moved by Soyeon's consideration during the whole recording process, and I think my vocal range has broadened thanks to this experience\".\n[\n111\n]\nPhilanthropy\n[\nedit\n]\nIn April 2020, Soyeon donated 30,000 hand sanitizers during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic in South Korea\nthrough the Holt Children's Welfare Association.\n[\n112\n]\nOn June 2, 2021, Soyeon opened a personal\nInstagram\naccount with several photos of selfies and an arm tattoo.\n[\n113\n]\nLater, Soyeon revealed the tattoo was a \"consent for organ donation\" tattoo on\nV Live\n. She stated, \"I saw an article saying that an average of 5 people a day died waiting for an organ donor. I thought about what I could do for others in my life, and then I came to a conclusion. It was a decision I made after cautiously thinking.\"\n[\n114\n]\n[\n115\n]\nOn January 18, 2022, Soyeon donated 20,000 briquettes to the Sharing Briquettes of Love campaign to help those in need, including unprivileged and low-income families,  throughout the cold winter.\n[\n112\n]\nIn February 2023, Soyeon donated\n\u20a9\n20 million to the Hope Bridge National Disaster Relief Association in order to aid those affected by the\n2023 Turkey\u2013Syria earthquake\n.\n[\n116\n]\nOn July 17, 2024, Soyeon donated\n\u20a9\n100 million to the Hope Bridge National Disaster Relief Association, as a member of Hope Bridge Honors Club, to help recover from heavy rain damage across South Korea.

T-ara became one of the best-selling girl groups, with So-yeon serving as the group's leader from December 2011 to July 2013. In June 2013, she debuted as a member of T-ara's sub-unit, QBS, which focused on the Japanese market. So-yeon departed from T-ara in 2017 after her contract expired and later pursued a solo career, releasing her first single in 2021.\n\nNamie Amuro (/ˌnɑːmiˈeɪ/ NAH-mee-AY; Japanese: 安室 奈美恵, romanized: Amuro Namie; born September 20, 1977) is a retired Japanese singer. She rose to prominence as a teen idol, and transitioned into a leading pop artist due to her versatility across music styles and visual presentation. Due to her career reinventions and longevity, she is known as an icon across Japan and Asia.[1][2][3][4] She has been referred to as the \\\"Queen of Japanese Pop\\\", and her influence domestically has drawn equivalent comparisons to artists such as Janet Jackson and Madonna in Western pop culture.[5][6][7][8] Born in Naha, Okinawa, Amuro debuted as the lead singer of the idol group Super Monkey's in 1992 when she was 14 years old. Despite early sales disappointments, Amuro's rising popularity helped to score a major hit with the 1995 Eurobeat single \\\"Try Me (Watashi o Shinjite)\\\".[9][10][11] Signing to Avex Trax for her solo career, Amuro catapulted to fame with a string of number one singles including \\\"Chase the Chance\\\" and \\\"Don't Wanna Cry\\\". A close partnership with renowned producer Tetsuya Komuro resulted in a dance-pop sound with Western influences. Her first four releases, including Sweet 19 Blues (1996) and Concentration 20 (1997), each received multi-million certifications. Her 1997 single \\\"Can You Celebrate?\\\" remains as the best selling single by a solo female artist in Japanese music history.[12][13][14] In the early 2000s, \\\"Never End\\\" became Amuro's last successful single before a decline in sales, and her music began evolving from pop to R&B as she reined in creative control of her career. This transition was marked by the Suite Chic project in 2002 and her sixth studio album Style (2003). Amuro's eighth studio album, Play (2007), with the hit single \\\"Baby Don't Cry\\\", began a period of commercial resurgence. Her comeback was solidified with the 2008 single \\\"60s 70s 80s\\\" and its parent release Best Fiction. She continued to experiment musically in the 2010s, dabbling in EDM and recording in English, beginning with her tenth studio album Uncontrolled (2012). It featured the million-certified single \\\"Love Story\\\". She later founded her own management company, Stella88, and record label, Dimension Point. Amuro finished her career with the 2017 greatest hits album Finally, which became the best selling album of the decade and made her the only artist to achieve a million-seller in each of their teens, 20s, 30s and 40s.[15] She officially retired from the music industry on September 16, 2018. As it coincided with the closure of the Heisei era (1989–2019), she became labelled as the representative \\\"Heisei diva\\\" with many calling it the \\\"end of an era\\\", in both senses.[16][17] Having sold more than 40 million records, Amuro is recognized as one of the best-selling artists in Japan by Oricon.[18] She has received accolades from the Japan Record Awards, Japan Gold Disc Awards, MTV Video Music Awards Japan and the World Music Awards. Amuro released her second compilation album, Love Enhanced Single Collection, on March 13, 2002.[84] The album reworked nearly every single released after her return from hiatus in 1998, with new vocals, mixes or rearrangements.[85] The single \\\"I Will\\\" was released a month before the album and became Amuro's first single below 100,000 units in sales.[18] Although the album was moderately successful, peaking at number three and shifting over 300,000 units, it only sold a fraction of its predecessor 181920 (1998).[86] In July 2002, Amuro divorced Maruyama, and legally changed her name back to Namie Amuro, having cited irreconcilable differences. According to reports, her divorce was due to her personal issues with Maruyama's family.[87] Retrospectively, The Times attributed her loss in popularity during this era to the attention surrounding her personal struggles, while The Japan Times cited the rise of newer artists Hikaru Utada and Ayumi Hamasaki, who achieved great success in the wake of her hiatus.[88][89] In a 2005 interview, Amuro said: \\\"Even my closest friend said I was finished, but I think I may be a little different from the others. My popularity plunged three years ago and I didn’t try to court publicity. It was a real challenge forcing myself to be consistent in not playing up to my fans.\\\"[88] Amuro started work on her sixth studio and third collaboration album with Dallas Austin, releasing Diane Warren-written single \\\"Wishing on the Same Star\\\" on September 11, 2002.[90] The single saw a large slip in Amuro's sales, only shifting 95,000 units by the end of the year.[18] In December 2002, Amuro was part of the musical project Suite Chic, involving several Japanese artists like Verbal, Zeebra, Dabo and DJ Muro.[91] The project released two singles, one studio album and one remix album before dissolution in 2003.[92][93][94] Amuro returned to solo activities in mid-2003, releasing the singles \\\"Shine More\\\", \\\"Put 'Em Up\\\", and the double A-side singles: \\\"So Crazy\\\" and \\\"Come\\\". The single's saw an exploration of westernised musical styles with American producers, including R&B producers Full Force and the work of Austin.[95] \\\"Come\\\" was used for the Japanese anime InuYasha,[96] and is a re-arranged song that was originally recorded by Australian recording artist and TV personality Sophie Monk.[97] At the end of the year, she released her sixth studio album and first album in three years, Style.[98] The album became her lowest chart album on the Oricon Albums Chart, peaking at number four. It is also her lowest selling studio album, shifting only 222,000 units in that region.[99] To promote the studio album, Amuro conducted her So Crazy Tour Featuring Best Singles on November 29.[100] The tour concluded in Japan on April 11, 2004.[101] She extended the concert tour, marked as a promotional appearance, in Taiwan,[102] and South Korea.[103] Shortly after the tour, she released the single \\\"All for You\\\" on July 22, 2004, confirming work on her seventh studio album.[104] This was followed by the double A-side single \\\"Girl Talk\\\" and \\\"Girl Talk/The Speed Star\\\", released on October 14, 2004.[105] It was successful in Japan, peaking at number two, and sold over 107,000 units in that region; it became her first top three single in two years.[106] Amuro decided not to appear on 55th Kōhaku Uta Gassen, although she had been invited to perform at the event.[107] She had previously attended the event nine years in a row.",

Despite positive reviews and a Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, \"Hands Up\" did not achieve significant commercial success, becoming the band's first single not to enter the US Billboard Hot 100 or the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart",

As it coincided with the closure of the Heisei era (1989–2019), she became labelled as the representative \\\"Heisei diva\\\" with many calling it the \\\"end of an era\\\", in both senses.[16][17] Having sold more than 40 million records, Amuro is recognized as one of the best-selling artists in Japan by Oricon.[18] She has received accolades from the Japan Record Awards, Japan Gold Disc Awards, MTV Video Music Awards Japan and the World Music Awards. Amuro released her second compilation album, Love Enhanced Single Collection, on March 13, 2002.[84] The album reworked nearly every single released after her return from hiatus in 1998, with new vocals, mixes or rearrangements.[85] The single \\\"I Will\\\" was released a month before the album and became Amuro's first single below 100,000 units in sales.[18] Although the album was moderately successful, peaking at number three and shifting over 300,000 units, it only sold a fraction of its predecessor 181920 (1998).[86] In July 2002, Amuro divorced Maruyama, and legally changed her name back to Namie Amuro, having cited irreconcilable differences. According to reports, her divorce was due to her personal issues with Maruyama's family.[87] Retrospectively, The Times attributed her loss in popularity during this era to the attention surrounding her personal struggles, while The Japan Times cited the rise of newer artists Hikaru Utada and Ayumi Hamasaki, who achieved great success in the wake of her hiatus.[88][89] In a 2005 interview, Amuro said: \\\"Even my closest friend said I was finished, but I think I may be a little different from the others. My popularity plunged three years ago and I didn’t try to court publicity. It was a real challenge forcing myself to be consistent in not playing up to my fans.\\\"[88] Amuro started work on her sixth studio and third collaboration album with Dallas Austin, releasing Diane Warren-written single \\\"Wishing on the Same Star\\\" on September 11, 2002.[90] The single saw a large slip in Amuro's sales, only shifting 95,000 units by the end of the year.[18] In December 2002, Amuro was part of the musical project Suite Chic, involving several Japanese artists like Verbal, Zeebra, Dabo and DJ Muro.[91] The project released two singles, one studio album and one remix album before dissolution in 2003.[92][93][94] Amuro returned to solo activities in mid-2003, releasing the singles \\\"Shine More\\\", \\\"Put 'Em Up\\\", and the double A-side singles: \\\"So Crazy\\\" and \\\"Come\\\". The single's saw an exploration of westernised musical styles with American producers, including R&B producers Full Force and the work of Austin.[95] \\\"Come\\\" was used for the Japanese anime InuYasha,[96] and is a re-arranged song that was originally recorded by Australian recording artist and TV personality Sophie Monk.[97] At the end of the year, she released her sixth studio album and first album in three years, Style.[98] The album became her lowest chart album on the Oricon Albums Chart, peaking at number four. It is also her lowest selling studio album, shifting only 222,000 units in that region.[99] To promote the studio album, Amuro conducted her So Crazy Tour Featuring Best Singles on November 29.[100] The tour concluded in Japan on April 11, 2004.[101] She extended the concert tour, marked as a promotional appearance, in Taiwan,[102] and South Korea.[103] Shortly after the tour, she released the single \\\"All for You\\\" on July 22, 2004, confirming work on her seventh studio album.[104] This was followed by the double A-side single \\\"Girl Talk\\\" and \\\"Girl Talk/The Speed Star\\\", released on October 14, 2004.[105] It was successful in Japan, peaking at number two, and sold over 107,000 units in that region; it became her first top three single in two years.[106] Amuro decided not to appear on 55th Kōhaku Uta Gassen, although she had been invited to perform at the event.[107] She had previously attended the event nine years in a row.Park So-yeon (born Park In-jung on October 5, 1987),[1] referred to as Soyeon, is a South Korean singer and actress. She debuted as a member of girl group T-ara in July 2009. The group went on to become one of the best-selling girl groups of all time.[2] She debuted as a solo artist in 2021.\n\nEarly life and education\nPark was born Park In-jung on October 5, 1987,[1][3] in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. She has legally changed her name to Park So-yeon. In 2005, she took part and was awarded the Gold Award for the CMB Chin Chin Singing Competition.[4] Park has studied at the prestigious Anyang High School of Arts, located in Anyang, Gyeonggi, South Korea.\n\nPark was formerly a trainee under SM Entertainment, preparing to be a member of girl group Girls' Generation. However, she left the company six months before their debut due to personal circumstances.[5] After debuting with T-ara, she revealed on the tvN's show Taxi that at that time she felt the opportunity came so easily and she was in two minds, not fully prepared for the debut.[6]\n\nCareer\n2007–2011: Career beginnings\nMain article: T-ara\nPark was the second new member to be added to T-ara after two former members Jiae and Jiwon left the group in mid-2009. In 2010, she was rushed to the hospital after complaints of not feeling well while filming for her cameo role in Master of Study.[citation needed] She was then diagnosed with H1N1 while T-ara was still promoting the follow-up track Like The First Time off of their first full-length album, Absolute First Album.[7] Park participated in the OSTs for the movie Death Bell 2: Bloody Camp and the SBS drama Coffee House.[citation needed] In 2011, she was a fixed cast member for KBS's variety show 100 Points Out Of 100.\n\n2012–2013: Acting roles and QBS\nMain article: QBS (band)\nPark participated in the musical adaption of T-ara's hit song Roly-Poly, which opened on January 13, 2012, at the Seongnam Arts Center.[8] She has stated that it is one of her dreams to stand on stage and act on it. She replaced Hyomin as T-ara's new leader starting on December 7, 2011, for their Lovey-Dovey promotions. She is the fourth leader of T-ara after Eunjung, Boram, and Hyomin. In July 2013, she stepped down as leader and Qri became the fifth leader.[9][10][11]\n\nPark appeared in the KBS drama Lovers of Haeundae as Lee Gwan-soon. The drama aired on August 13, 2012.[12][better source needed] Park along with Qri and Boram formed a sub-group called QBS in May 2013. The sub-group focused on the Japanese market. They released their debut single titled \"Kaze no You ni\" (風のように, Like the Wind) on June 26, 2013.[citation needed]\n\n2017–present: Departure from T-ara and solo debut\nOn March 6, 2017 MBK announced that T-ara would be releasing their last album as a six-member group in May, after Boram and Park's contracts ended, and the other members would remain until December 31, 2017.[13] On May 7, MBK Entertainment revealed the group's plans had changed and that the new album's release had been rescheduled to June 2017, with Boram and Park not participating due to the expiry of their contracts.[14] On May 8, it was announced that T-ara's last performance as a six-member group would be in Taiwan concert on May 13.[15][16]\n\nOn July 11, 2020, it was announced that Park had signed with Think Entertainment.[17] On February 5, 2021, Park released her first ever single as a solo artist in 12 years entitled \"They Are All The Same\" under Think Entertainment.[18] Before the release of the song, she received support from the members of T-ara. On March 24, 2021, Park released her second single entitled \"Interview\".[19]\n\nEndorsements\nIn February 2021, Park became the exclusive model for the Korean tea brand \"HOBEATEE\".[20] In March 2021, the brand announced a 100% sold-out.[21] It was also mentioned that Park helped the brand's image by drawing attention from both domestic users and her overseas Chinese fans.[22]\n\nPersonal life\nOn January 18, 2022, Park's agency confirmed that she will marry soccer player Cho Yu-min in November 2022. They have been in a relationship for 3 years.[23] Later, it was announced the wedding ceremony in November has been postponed until next year, due to Cho Yu-min joined the national team and planning to focus for the 2022 FIFA Qatar World Cup. But the couple had already registered their marriage and were a legal couple.[24] On September 22, Park revealed through her Instagram that she bought her mother a 3-volume apartment in Seoul's green forest area.[25]\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn May 2012, Park represented T-ara and attended public interest agreement ceremony to sign an agreement with TTOMA, a drinks brand for which T-ara was a model for. Subsequently, a portion of proceeds from T-ara's personalized drinks with the brand will be donated to the Fruit of Love Foundation.[26]\n\nPark is an advocate for animal protection. In 2015, she participated the anti-animal abuse campaign hosted by Blue Angel Volunteer Group.[27] On March 29, 2015, she held a fan sign at the 2015 K-Pet Fair. All proceeds went to the organization.[28] In 2017, Park was revealed to have been secretly donating ₩1 million every month for 2 years to Blue Angel Volunteer Group. In November that year, News1 reported that Park is an honorary member of the organization.[29]",

The university is represented by the\nFlorida Gators\nsports teams in\nNCAA\ncompetitions.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nHistory of Gainesville, Florida\nand\nTimeline of Gainesville, Florida\nThere is archeological evidence, from about 12,000 years ago, of the presence of\nPaleo-Indians\nin the Gainesville area, although it is not known if there were any permanent settlements.\n[\n8\n]\nA\nDeptford culture\ncampsite existed in Gainesville and was estimated to have been used between 500 BCE and 100 CE.\n[\n9\n]\nThe Deptford people moved south into Paynes Prairie and Orange Lake during the first century and evolved into the\nCades Pond culture\n.\n[\n10\n]\nThe Deptford people who remained in the Gainesville area were displaced by migrants from southern Georgia sometime in the seventh century.\n[\n10\n]\nThese migrants evolved into the\nAlachua culture\nand they built their burial mound on top of the Deptford culture campsite.\n[\n9\n]\nWhen Europeans made first contact in the area, the\nPotano\nlived in the area. They were descendants of the Alachua culture people.\n[\n11\n]\nEuropean contact diminished the numbers of native peoples (through disease, enslavement, war) and Spanish colonists began cattle ranching in the Paynes Prairie area in the 18th century. The Spanish ceded Florida to the US in 1821.\n[\n12\n]\nGainesville was established in 1854 and named after\nEdmund P. Gaines\n.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\nThe town of Gainesville was incorporated in 1869\n[\n15\n]\nand chartered as a city in 1907.\n[\n16\n]\nThe University of the State of Florida was moved from Lake City to Gainesville in 1906 and its name was simplified to\nUniversity of Florida\nin 1909.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nGeography\n[\nedit\n]\nGainesville is located at 29\u00b039'55\" North, 82\u00b020'10\" West (29.665245, \u221282.336097),\n[\n18\n]\n. According to the\nUnited States Census Bureau\n, the city has an area of 62.4 square miles (161.6\u00a0km\n2\n), of which 61.3 square miles (158.8\u00a0km\n2\n) is land and 1.1 square miles (2.8\u00a0km\n2\n) is water. The total area is 1.74% water.\n[\n19\n]\nGainesville's tree canopy is both dense and species rich, including broadleaf evergreens, conifers, and deciduous species; the city has been recognized by the\nNational Arbor Day Foundation\nevery year since 1982 as a \"Tree City, USA\". A 2016 ecological assessment indicates Gainesville's urban tree canopy covers 47 percent of its land area.\n[\n20\n]\nGainesville is surrounded by rural areas, including the 21,000-acre (8,500\u00a0ha) wilderness of\nPaynes Prairie\non its southern edge. The area is dominated by the\nUniversity of Florida\n,\n[\n21\n]\nwhich in 2008 was the third-largest university by enrollment in the US,\n[\n22\n]\nand as of 2021 was the\nfourth-largest\n.\nCityscape\n[\nedit\n]\nMixed-use student housing (left side) along US 441, viewed from near the main entrance to the University of Florida (bottom left)\nGainesville's downtown\nSince the 1990s, suburban sprawl has been a concern for a majority of the city commissioners. The \"New Urbanization\" plan to gentrify the area between historic Downtown and the University of Florida may slow the growth of suburban sectors and spark a migration toward upper-level apartments in the inner city. The area immediately north of the university is also seeing active redevelopment. Many gentrification plans rely on tax incentives that have sparked controversy\n[\n23\n]\nand are sometimes unsuccessful. University Corners, which would not have been proposed without a $98 million tax incentive program by the city,\n[\n24\n]\nwas to be \"a crowning jewel of the city's redevelopment efforts\",\n[\n25\n]\n450 condos and hotel units and 98,000 square feet (9,100\u00a0m\n2\n) of retail space in eight stories covering three city blocks,\n[\n26\n]\non 3.4 acres (1.4\u00a0ha) purchased for $15.5 million.\n[\n27\n]\n19 thriving businesses\n[\n23\n]\nwere demolished in April 2007,\n[\n27\n]\nbut in May 2008 deposit checks were refunded to about 105 people who reserved units,\n[\n28\n]\nand in July 2008 developers spent \"$120,000 to beautify the site, so we won't have this ugly green fence\".\n[\n27\n]\nGainesville's east side houses the majority of the city's African-American community, while the west side consists of the mainly student and White resident communities. West of the city limits are large-scale planned communities, most notably\nHaile Plantation\n, which was built on the site of its eponymous former plantation.\nThe destruction of the city's landmark\nVictorian\ncourthouse in the 1960s, which some considered unnecessary, brought the idea of historic preservation to the community's attention. The bland county building that replaced the grand courthouse became known to some locals as the \"air conditioner\". Additional destruction of the downtown area's historic buildings has left a small handful of older buildings, like the\nHippodrome State Theatre\n, at one time a federal building. However, revitalization of the city's core has picked up, and the city is replacing many parking lots and underutilized buildings with infill development and near-campus housing that blend with existing historic structures. There is a proposal to rebuild a replica of the old courthouse on a parking lot one block from the original location.\nHelping in this effort are the number of areas and buildings added to the\nNational Register of Historic Places\n. Dozens of examples of restored Victorian and\nQueen Anne style\nresidences constructed in the city's agricultural heyday of the 1880s and 1890s can be found in the following districts:\nNortheast Gainesville Residential District\nSoutheast Gainesville Residential District\nPleasant Street Historic District\nAdditionally, the\nUniversity of Florida Campus Historic District\n, consisting of 11 buildings and 14 contributing properties, lies within the city's boundaries. Most of the buildings in the Campus Historic District are constructed in variations of\nCollegiate Gothic\narchitecture, which returned to prominence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nHistoric structures on the Register in and around downtown are:\nBailey Plantation House\n(1854)\nColson House\n(1905)\nMatheson House\n(1867)\nThomas Hotel\n(1910)\nThe\nOld Post Office\n(now the\nHippodrome State Theatre\n) (1911)\nMasonic Temple\n(1908)\nSeagle Building\n(1926), downtown Gainesville's tallest building.\nBaird Hardware Company Warehouse\n(1890)\nCox Furniture Store\n(1875)\nCox Furniture Warehouse\n(c. 1890)\nEpworth Hall\n(1884)\nOld Gainesville Depot\n(1907)\nMary Phifer McKenzie House\n(1895)\nStar Garage\n(1902)\nA.

Due to its inland location, Gainesville experiences wide temperature fluctuations, and it is part of USDA Plant\nhardiness zone\n9a.\n[\n32\n]\nDuring the hot season, from roughly May 15 to September 30, the city's climate is similar to the rest of the state, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms and high humidity. Average temperatures range from the low 70s (21\u201323\u00a0\u00b0C) at night to around 91\u00a0\u00b0F (33\u00a0\u00b0C) during the day.\nIn the cool season, Gainesville experiences 15 nights of temperatures at freezing or below and sustained freezes every few years. The record low of 6\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221214\u00a0\u00b0C) was reached on\nFebruary 13, 1899\n,\n[\n33\n]\nand the city experienced light snow and freezing rain on Christmas Eve, 1989. Traces of snow were also recorded in 1977,\n[\n34\n]\n1996, 2010\n[\n35\n]\nand 2016.\n[\n36\n]\nThe daily average temperature in January is 54.8\u00a0\u00b0F (12.7\u00a0\u00b0C); on average, the window for freezing temperatures is December 4 to February 24, allowing a growing season of 282\u00a0days, although the 1949\u201350 winter season did not record a freeze.\n[\n37\n]\nLike the rest of the state, cold temperatures are almost always accompanied by clear skies and\nhigh pressure systems\n; snow is therefore rare. Temperatures reaching 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) or falling below 20\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22127\u00a0\u00b0C) are rare, having respectively last occurred on June 4, 2019, and January 11, 2010.\nThe city's flora and fauna are also distinct from coastal regions of the state, and include many deciduous species, such as\ndogwood\n, maple, hickory and\nsweet gum\n, alongside palms,\nlive oaks\n, and other evergreens. This allows the city to enjoy brief periods of fall color in late November and December and a noticeable, prolonged spring from mid-February through early April.

The restaurants near the\nUniversity of Florida\nalso tend to be inexpensive. The property taxes are high to offset the cost of the university, as the university's land is tax-exempt, but the median home cost is slightly below the national average, and Gainesville residents, like all Floridians, do not pay state income taxes.\nThe city's job market scored only 6 out of a possible 100 points in the\nCities Ranked and Rated\nguide, as the downside to the low cost of living is an extremely weak local job market that is oversupplied with college-educated residents. Gainesville's\nmedian income\nis slightly below the U.S. average.\nGainesville heavily promoted\nsolar power\nby creating the first\nfeed-in tariff\n(FIT) in the United States. The FIT allowed small businesses and homeowners to supply electricity into the municipal\npower grid\nand paid a premium for the clean, on-site generated solar electricity. The FIT started with a rate of $0.32 per\nkilowatt-hour\nand allowed a person or business to enter into a 20-year contract where Gainesville Regional Utilities would purchase the power for 20 years.\n[\n50\n]\nThe FIT ended in 2013,\n[\n51\n]\nwhen the rate was set at $0.18 per kWh, but the city is still seen as a leader in solar power. This increase in solar installations put Gainesville at number 5 in the world in solar installed per capita, beating Japan, France, China and all of the US.\n[\n52\n]\nThe sports drink\nGatorade\nwas invented in Gainesville in the 1960s to help refresh the UF football team.

Plus, all the local news and sports you need -- all while you're on the go -- on the WCJB TV20 News app!\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s New\nDec 20, 2024\nVersion 2.0.15\nGeneral fixes and performance enhancements\nRatings and Reviews\n3.4\nout of 5\n62 Ratings\n62 Ratings\nUnhappy club of subscribers\n,\n06/12/2024\nApp is Lacking\nI utilize the WCJB TV20 news app to view the 6:00 news from NC. I use an Apple TV 4K I own a townhouse in Gainesville and that is the only means I have to keep up what is going on in Gainesville and with the Gators. Recently a change was made to the app where there are now a number of windows where you can view different topics.  I utilize the main window to see the news. Here is the problem, after the news is over there is no way to exit the app and go back to the Apple TV Home Screen.  The only way I can get my Apple TV released from the app is to unplug the Apple TV.  If there is a normal way to exit the app, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t found it. Normally all I used to have to do is just keep pressing the Menu button on my Apple TV remote to get back to the Apple TV Home Screen . Will you please fix this or tell me where the exit button is to exit the app? I was gracious with three stars. It probably should have been two stars.\nYarleygirl\n,\n03/03/2022\nNot so informative\nI see stories online from WCJB on other programs yet when I use the WCJB app directly, I can't find the article.  I get an error message instead.  I find this app to be lacking in everything.  I'll get my local news from other means.\nRox24sky\n,\n07/04/2024\nGreat navigation easy to use\nAlways use news 20 app for my news source. keeps me up to day with all news in my area as well as what's trending in world news.\ni love this app because it's easy to use, navigation is easy. 5  starts from me!\nthank you all for all your hard work, so we can stay in the know!! \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008a\nApp Privacy\nThe developer,\nGray Television Group, Inc.\n, indicated that the app\u00e2\u0080\u0099s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

The university is represented by the\nFlorida Gators\nsports teams in\nNCAA\ncompetitions.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nHistory of Gainesville, Florida\nand\nTimeline of Gainesville, Florida\nThere is archeological evidence, from about 12,000 years ago, of the presence of\nPaleo-Indians\nin the Gainesville area, although it is not known if there were any permanent settlements.\n[\n8\n]\nA\nDeptford culture\ncampsite existed in Gainesville and was estimated to have been used between 500 BCE and 100 CE.\n[\n9\n]\nThe Deptford people moved south into Paynes Prairie and Orange Lake during the first century and evolved into the\nCades Pond culture\n.\n[\n10\n]\nThe Deptford people who remained in the Gainesville area were displaced by migrants from southern Georgia sometime in the seventh century.\n[\n10\n]\nThese migrants evolved into the\nAlachua culture\nand they built their burial mound on top of the Deptford culture campsite.\n[\n9\n]\nWhen Europeans made first contact in the area, the\nPotano\nlived in the area. They were descendants of the Alachua culture people.\n[\n11\n]\nEuropean contact diminished the numbers of native peoples (through disease, enslavement, war) and Spanish colonists began cattle ranching in the Paynes Prairie area in the 18th century. The Spanish ceded Florida to the US in 1821.\n[\n12\n]\nGainesville was established in 1854 and named after\nEdmund P. Gaines\n.\n[\n13\n]\n[\n14\n]\nThe town of Gainesville was incorporated in 1869\n[\n15\n]\nand chartered as a city in 1907.\n[\n16\n]\nThe University of the State of Florida was moved from Lake City to Gainesville in 1906 and its name was simplified to\nUniversity of Florida\nin 1909.\n[\n16\n]\n[\n17\n]\nGeography\n[\nedit\n]\nGainesville is located at 29\u00b039'55\" North, 82\u00b020'10\" West (29.665245, \u221282.336097),\n[\n18\n]\n. According to the\nUnited States Census Bureau\n, the city has an area of 62.4 square miles (161.6\u00a0km\n2\n), of which 61.3 square miles (158.8\u00a0km\n2\n) is land and 1.1 square miles (2.8\u00a0km\n2\n) is water. The total area is 1.74% water.\n[\n19\n]\nGainesville's tree canopy is both dense and species rich, including broadleaf evergreens, conifers, and deciduous species; the city has been recognized by the\nNational Arbor Day Foundation\nevery year since 1982 as a \"Tree City, USA\". A 2016 ecological assessment indicates Gainesville's urban tree canopy covers 47 percent of its land area.\n[\n20\n]\nGainesville is surrounded by rural areas, including the 21,000-acre (8,500\u00a0ha) wilderness of\nPaynes Prairie\non its southern edge. The area is dominated by the\nUniversity of Florida\n,\n[\n21\n]\nwhich in 2008 was the third-largest university by enrollment in the US,\n[\n22\n]\nand as of 2021 was the\nfourth-largest\n.\nCityscape\n[\nedit\n]\nMixed-use student housing (left side) along US 441, viewed from near the main entrance to the University of Florida (bottom left)\nGainesville's downtown\nSince the 1990s, suburban sprawl has been a concern for a majority of the city commissioners. The \"New Urbanization\" plan to gentrify the area between historic Downtown and the University of Florida may slow the growth of suburban sectors and spark a migration toward upper-level apartments in the inner city. The area immediately north of the university is also seeing active redevelopment. Many gentrification plans rely on tax incentives that have sparked controversy\n[\n23\n]\nand are sometimes unsuccessful. University Corners, which would not have been proposed without a $98 million tax incentive program by the city,\n[\n24\n]\nwas to be \"a crowning jewel of the city's redevelopment efforts\",\n[\n25\n]\n450 condos and hotel units and 98,000 square feet (9,100\u00a0m\n2\n) of retail space in eight stories covering three city blocks,\n[\n26\n]\non 3.4 acres (1.4\u00a0ha) purchased for $15.5 million.\n[\n27\n]\n19 thriving businesses\n[\n23\n]\nwere demolished in April 2007,\n[\n27\n]\nbut in May 2008 deposit checks were refunded to about 105 people who reserved units,\n[\n28\n]\nand in July 2008 developers spent \"$120,000 to beautify the site, so we won't have this ugly green fence\".\n[\n27\n]\nGainesville's east side houses the majority of the city's African-American community, while the west side consists of the mainly student and White resident communities. West of the city limits are large-scale planned communities, most notably\nHaile Plantation\n, which was built on the site of its eponymous former plantation.\nThe destruction of the city's landmark\nVictorian\ncourthouse in the 1960s, which some considered unnecessary, brought the idea of historic preservation to the community's attention. The bland county building that replaced the grand courthouse became known to some locals as the \"air conditioner\". Additional destruction of the downtown area's historic buildings has left a small handful of older buildings, like the\nHippodrome State Theatre\n, at one time a federal building. However, revitalization of the city's core has picked up, and the city is replacing many parking lots and underutilized buildings with infill development and near-campus housing that blend with existing historic structures. There is a proposal to rebuild a replica of the old courthouse on a parking lot one block from the original location.\nHelping in this effort are the number of areas and buildings added to the\nNational Register of Historic Places\n. Dozens of examples of restored Victorian and\nQueen Anne style\nresidences constructed in the city's agricultural heyday of the 1880s and 1890s can be found in the following districts:\nNortheast Gainesville Residential District\nSoutheast Gainesville Residential District\nPleasant Street Historic District\nAdditionally, the\nUniversity of Florida Campus Historic District\n, consisting of 11 buildings and 14 contributing properties, lies within the city's boundaries. Most of the buildings in the Campus Historic District are constructed in variations of\nCollegiate Gothic\narchitecture, which returned to prominence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nHistoric structures on the Register in and around downtown are:\nBailey Plantation House\n(1854)\nColson House\n(1905)\nMatheson House\n(1867)\nThomas Hotel\n(1910)\nThe\nOld Post Office\n(now the\nHippodrome State Theatre\n) (1911)\nMasonic Temple\n(1908)\nSeagle Building\n(1926), downtown Gainesville's tallest building.\nBaird Hardware Company Warehouse\n(1890)\nCox Furniture Store\n(1875)\nCox Furniture Warehouse\n(c. 1890)\nEpworth Hall\n(1884)\nOld Gainesville Depot\n(1907)\nMary Phifer McKenzie House\n(1895)\nStar Garage\n(1902)\nA.

Due to its inland location, Gainesville experiences wide temperature fluctuations, and it is part of USDA Plant\nhardiness zone\n9a.\n[\n32\n]\nDuring the hot season, from roughly May 15 to September 30, the city's climate is similar to the rest of the state, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms and high humidity. Average temperatures range from the low 70s (21\u201323\u00a0\u00b0C) at night to around 91\u00a0\u00b0F (33\u00a0\u00b0C) during the day.\nIn the cool season, Gainesville experiences 15 nights of temperatures at freezing or below and sustained freezes every few years. The record low of 6\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221214\u00a0\u00b0C) was reached on\nFebruary 13, 1899\n,\n[\n33\n]\nand the city experienced light snow and freezing rain on Christmas Eve, 1989. Traces of snow were also recorded in 1977,\n[\n34\n]\n1996, 2010\n[\n35\n]\nand 2016.\n[\n36\n]\nThe daily average temperature in January is 54.8\u00a0\u00b0F (12.7\u00a0\u00b0C); on average, the window for freezing temperatures is December 4 to February 24, allowing a growing season of 282\u00a0days, although the 1949\u201350 winter season did not record a freeze.\n[\n37\n]\nLike the rest of the state, cold temperatures are almost always accompanied by clear skies and\nhigh pressure systems\n; snow is therefore rare. Temperatures reaching 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) or falling below 20\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22127\u00a0\u00b0C) are rare, having respectively last occurred on June 4, 2019, and January 11, 2010.\nThe city's flora and fauna are also distinct from coastal regions of the state, and include many deciduous species, such as\ndogwood\n, maple, hickory and\nsweet gum\n, alongside palms,\nlive oaks\n, and other evergreens. This allows the city to enjoy brief periods of fall color in late November and December and a noticeable, prolonged spring from mid-February through early April. This is a generally pleasant period, as colorful blooms of\nazalea\nand\nredbud\ncomplement a cloudless blue sky, for this is also the period of the lowest precipitation and lowest humidity. The city averages 48.31 inches (1,230\u00a0mm) of rain per year. June through September accounts for most annual rainfall, while autumn and early winter are the driest.\nClimate data for Gainesville, Florida (\nGainesville Regional Airport\n), 1991\u22122020 normals,\n[\n38\n]\nextremes 1890\u2212present\nMonth\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nYear\nRecord high \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n89\n(32)\n91\n(33)\n96\n(36)\n96\n(36)\n102\n(39)\n104\n(40)\n102\n(39)\n100\n(38)\n99\n(37)\n96\n(36)\n91\n(33)\n87\n(31)\n104\n(40)\nMean maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n80.8\n(27.1)\n83.3\n(28.5)\n86.4\n(30.2)\n89.8\n(32.1)\n94.3\n(34.6)\n96.5\n(35.8)\n96.0\n(35.6)\n95.1\n(35.1)\n93.3\n(34.1)\n89.8\n(32.1)\n85.1\n(29.5)\n81.3\n(27.4)\n97.8\n(36.6)\nMean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n67.2\n(19.6)\n70.9\n(21.6)\n76.0\n(24.4)\n81.5\n(27.5)\n87.6\n(30.9)\n90.3\n(32.4)\n91.1\n(32.8)\n90.6\n(32.6)\n88.1\n(31.2)\n82.3\n(27.9)\n74.7\n(23.7)\n69.3\n(20.7)\n80.8\n(27.1)\nDaily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n54.8\n(12.7)\n58.4\n(14.7)\n62.7\n(17.1)\n68.5\n(20.3)\n75.0\n(23.9)\n79.9\n(26.6)\n81.4\n(27.4)\n81.3\n(27.4)\n78.8\n(26.0)\n71.4\n(21.9)\n62.7\n(17.1)\n57.3\n(14.1)\n69.3\n(20.7)\nMean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n42.8\n(6.0)\n46.2\n(7.9)\n50.0\n(10.0)\n55.8\n(13.2)\n62.9\n(17.2)\n69.8\n(21.0)\n72.0\n(22.2)\n72.2\n(22.3)\n69.5\n(20.8)\n60.8\n(16.0)\n50.8\n(10.4)\n45.5\n(7.5)\n58.3\n(14.6)\nMean minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n24.8\n(\u22124.0)\n27.7\n(\u22122.4)\n32.0\n(0.0)\n40.4\n(4.7)\n50.4\n(10.2)\n63.0\n(17.2)\n67.4\n(19.7)\n67.6\n(19.8)\n60.2\n(15.7)\n43.4\n(6.3)\n32.5\n(0.3)\n28.3\n(\u22122.1)\n22.8\n(\u22125.1)\nRecord low \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n10\n(\u221212)\n6\n(\u221214)\n22\n(\u22126)\n32\n(0)\n42\n(6)\n50\n(10)\n60\n(16)\n60\n(16)\n48\n(9)\n32\n(0)\n20\n(\u22127)\n13\n(\u221211)\n6\n(\u221214)\nAverage\nprecipitation\ninches (mm)\n3.29\n(84)\n2.67\n(68)\n3.49\n(89)\n2.74\n(70)\n3.08\n(78)\n7.56\n(192)\n6.68\n(170)\n6.40\n(163)\n5.05\n(128)\n2.68\n(68)\n1.79\n(45)\n2.88\n(73)\n48.31\n(1,227)\nAverage precipitation days\n(\u2265 0.01 in)\n8.2\n7.2\n7.4\n6.2\n6.9\n14.9\n15.9\n16.1\n11.0\n7.2\n5.8\n7.0\n113.8\nSource: NOAA\n[\n37\n]\n[\n39\n]\nDemographics\n[\nedit\n]\nHistorical population\nCensus\nPop.\nNote\n%\u00b1\n1890\n2,790\n\u2014\n1900\n3,633\n30.2%\n1910\n6,183\n70.2%\n1920\n6,860\n10.9%\n1930\n10,465\n52.6%\n1940\n13,757\n31.5%\n1950\n26,861\n95.3%\n1960\n29,701\n10.6%\n1970\n64,510\n117.2%\n1980\n81,371\n26.1%\n1990\n84,770\n4.2%\n2000\n95,447\n12.6%\n2010\n124,354\n30.3%\n2020\n141,085\n13.5%\nU.S. Decennial Census\n[\n40\n]\nGainesville, Florida \u2013 Racial and ethnic composition\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

The restaurants near the\nUniversity of Florida\nalso tend to be inexpensive. The property taxes are high to offset the cost of the university, as the university's land is tax-exempt, but the median home cost is slightly below the national average, and Gainesville residents, like all Floridians, do not pay state income taxes.\nThe city's job market scored only 6 out of a possible 100 points in the\nCities Ranked and Rated\nguide, as the downside to the low cost of living is an extremely weak local job market that is oversupplied with college-educated residents. Gainesville's\nmedian income\nis slightly below the U.S. average.\nGainesville heavily promoted\nsolar power\nby creating the first\nfeed-in tariff\n(FIT) in the United States. The FIT allowed small businesses and homeowners to supply electricity into the municipal\npower grid\nand paid a premium for the clean, on-site generated solar electricity.

    "evidence": "Mostly Movies: From My Collection: Rounders Movie Review\nTuesday, December 2, 2014\nFrom My Collection: Rounders Movie Review\nI reviewed this film sixteen years ago in the Connecticut College Voice. It is far too embarrassing to republish the original so in revisiting the film, here is my new and updated reviews.\nFor a brief time in the 90s and early 2000s, director\nJohn Dahl was establishing himself (in my estimation, at least) as a maker of\ndark and fascinating tales of low moral character or the underbelly of places\nwe thought we knew. In 1998 he brought us, via a screenplay by David Levien and\nBrian Koppelman, to the underground and illegal poker scene of New York City in\nRounders\n. He showed us a seedy\nversion of New York that stands outside the realm of most Hollywood movies. And\nit\u2019s populated with a cast of characters, most of whom you wouldn\u2019t be too\nquick to invite into your home.\nMatt Damon, riding the very peak of his late 90s\npopularity, stars as Mike McDermott. He\u2019s a young law student who moonlights as\na card player earning his tuition by outplaying some of the city\u2019s best and, in\nsome cases, most dangerous card players. Poker is one of those activities that\nhas often been good for the movies. It\u2019s easy to shoot a bunch of stationary\ncharacters seated around a table and there\u2019s a natural building of tension in\npoker that marries well to cinema. But\nRounders\njust about crushes most other car gambling movies. Mike McD, as he\u2019s known to\nfriends and associates, narrates his tale and makes it look like one of the\nmost exciting things a guy can get into, even when it does clean him out or\nleave him battered and bruised.\nIn the first five minutes we watch as Mike drops thirty\nthousand dollars on a cocky and stupid move against Teddy \u201cKGB,\u201d a Russian\nmafia-connected gambler who runs one of several illegal card houses Mike frequents.\nDamon makes us feel that hollowness in the pit of his stomach as his enormous\npile of chips is rakes away.\nAfter that, eh calls it quits, makes a promise to his\ngirlfriend, Jo (Gretchen Mol) and goes to work for Joey \u201cKnish,\u201d (John\nTurturro), a guy who plays not for the thrill of victory, but to earn a living.\nLike any good story that has the hero stepping away from the thing he loves so\nearly in the plot, all we have to do is wonder who or what will pull him back.\nAnd\nRounders\n\u2019 answers with a wallop\nin the form of \u201cWorm,\u201d (Edward Norton), Mike\u2019s childhood friend who gets\nreleased from prison and owes some serious money to people who aren\u2019t playing\naround.\nI suppose I fell for\nRounders\nin 1998 because I was also swept up in the Damon phenom story. But it\u2019s also\nNorton\u2019s presence which really sold me. He upstages Damon and steals the show\nevery time he\u2019s on screen. Worm is such a compelling foil because the fact that\nhe\u2019s Mike\u2019s best friend makes you want to like him, but he\u2019s so guileless, so\nirresponsible, dangerously impulsive, and frustratingly idiotic that you pull\nyour hair out as he takes advantage of the good will line of credit Mike has\nextended him or steps into a room full of state troopers exactly when he knew\nhe should have stayed far away. Worm makes this more than just a story about a\nguy who figures out how good he is at poker. He makes it into a story about how\nfar friendship can be pushed and what the limits of a friend\u2019s charity can be.\nRounders\nstill\nresonates today because it is so much better than the sum of its parts. An\nadditional layer of texture in the story has Mike trying to find himself and\ngetting what he probably doesn\u2019t realize at the time is sage advice from his\nlaw professor (Martin Landau in a small but memorable role), who talks about\nhis own familial ostracization for failing to become a rabbi. Everyone has a\ncalling and once we find out what that is, we owe it to ourselves to pursue it.\nIs poker playing and illegal gambling a calling? Is it respectable? Not to the\npeople in Mike\u2019s other life: the girlfriend; the law school classmates; the\njudges and district attorneys. That he has to compartmentalize his life to\nseparate the two sides tells us something about how the one half will have\nnothing to do with the other. Knish creates one of the film\u2019s most\nuncomfortable moments for Mike when he shows up at the law library while Mike\nis meeting with a study group. One world intrudes on the other in a way that is\nno understandable and totally unacceptable to Mike\u2019s girlfriend, among others.\nSo at its most basic,\nRounders\nis a story of finding oneself and does it in a setting that was (and still is,\nI would say) fresh. More than that, however, it\u2019s a really well-made and\nwell-written old school Hollywood entertainment. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s at times\ntragic, but it\u2019s also a really well-played thriller. It\u2019s also just a kick-ass\nstory and it\u2019s about men (and some women) playing poker. It rises way above the\nformula that dictates all of its story beats and remains one of my favorites of\na decade that preceded the fall.\nat\nDecember 02, 2014\nEmail This\nBlogThis!\nShare to X\nShare to Facebook\nShare to Pinterest\nLabels:\n1998\n,\nbest of the 90s\n,\nBrian Koppelman\n,\nDavid Levien\n,\ndrama\n,\nEdward Norton\n,\nGretchen Mol\n,\nJohn Dahl\n,\nJohn Malkovich\n,\nJohn Turturro\n,\nMartin Landau\n,\nMatt Damon\n,\nmy collection\n,\nNew York films\n,\nreview\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment\nNewer Post\nOlder Post\nHome\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\n97th Academy Awards nomination predictions\nBest Picture Anora The Brutalist A Complete Unknown Conclave Dune: Part Two Emilia P\u00e9rez A Real Pain Sing Sing The Substance Wicked Best Dir...\nIncendies Movie Review\nThis film will open commercially in the United States on 22 April 2011.

    "evidence": "Rounders is a 1998 American drama film about the underground world of high-stakes poker, directed by John Dahl and starring Matt Damon and Edward Norton. The story follows two friends who need to win at high-stakes poker to quickly pay off a large debt. The term rounder refers to a person traveling around from city to city seeking high-stakes card games. Rounders opened to mixed reviews and was moderately successful at the box office. Following the poker boom in the early 2000s, the film became a cult hit. A novelization of the film was written by Kevin Canty and released by Hyperion Books. Plot New York City law student and gifted poker player Mike McDermott dreams of winning the World Series of Poker. At an underground Texas hold 'em game run by Russian mobster Teddy \"KGB\", an overconfident Mike loses his entire $30,000 bankroll in a single hand. Shaken, he promises his girlfriend and fellow student Jo he has quit poker, and concentrates on law school. His mentor Joey Knish offers to stake him to rebuild his bankroll but Mike declines and accepts a part-time job to make money. Months pass and Mike stays true to his promise until his childhood friend Lester \"Worm\" Murphy is released from prison. While Mike is an honest player, Worm is a hustler and unapologetic cheat. To help Worm pay off a debt, Mike sets him up with games across town and reluctantly sits in on one, interfering with his studies and his relationship with Jo. Mike allows Worm to play on his credit at the Chesterfield Club. After being loaned $2,000, Worm gets up to $10,000 and cashes out for the full amount which starts a tab in Mike's name. Worm runs into Grama, a dangerous pimp, who reveals he is working for KGB and has bought Worm's debt, now totaling $25,000 with interest. Grama takes Worm's $10,000, threatening him to pay the rest. As Mike returns to his poker lifestyle and friends, Jo ends their relationship. Mike learns from Petra at the Chesterfield that Worm has racked up a $7,000 debt in Mike's name. Worm tells Mike about Grama but withholds the KGB connection. Mike vouches for Worm to Grama but Worm and Grama insult each other and nearly come to blows. Grama gives them five days to pay the remaining $15,000. Mike decides to help Worm win the money by playing in several games in and around the city. Mike wins $7,200 in three days, but still needs to more than double it in forty-eight hours. Worm drives Mike to Binghamton for a game hosted by New York state troopers, where he comes close to winning the $7,800 needed before Worm unexpectedly joins the game. Soon after, a trooper catches Worm base-dealing to help Mike; they are beaten up and relieved of their entire bankroll. Worm confesses that Grama is working for KGB and decides to flee; Mike returns to the city alone. Mike asks Grama for more time, to no avail. He asks Knish for the money but is refused out of principle. Knish chastises him for poor decisions and Mike finally reveals why he took the ill-fated risk at KGB's club: he once beat poker legend Johnny Chan at a single hand in Atlantic City and thinks he can compete and possibly win the World Series of Poker. Desperate, Mike goes to his law professor, Petrovsky, who loans him $10,000. Mike challenges KGB to a second heads-up no-limit Texas hold 'em game for the remaining debt, with winner-take-all stakes, which KGB accepts. Mike beats KGB in the first session, winning $20,000. KGB offers to let Mike's winnings \"ride\" and continue the game, but Mike – with enough to pay off most of his debts – declines. As he is about to leave, KGB taunts that he is paying Mike with the money that he won from their previous game. Mike changes his mind and decides to continue playing. Mike doubles the blinds at the risk of losing everything, and possibly his life, to KGB. As the night wears on, he spots KGB's tell and folds a crucial hand. Irate at missing a chance to bust Mike, KGB begins to play on \"tilt\". In the final hand, Mike baits a boastful KGB into going all-in and defeats him with a nut straight. KGB throws a tantrum at having been lured into a mistake. The rattled KGB calls off his goons and admits that Mike won fairly, allowing him to leave with his winnings. With over $60,000, Mike settles Worm's $15,000 debt to Grama, the Chesterfield's $6,000 credit, his professor's $10,000 loan, and restores his original bankroll of \"three stacks of high society\". He drops out of law school, bids Jo goodbye, and leaves for Las Vegas to play in the World Series of Poker. Cast Matt Damon as Mike McDermott Edward Norton as Lester \"Worm\" Murphy John Malkovich as Teddy \"KGB\" John Turturro as Joey Knish[a] Famke Janssen as Petra Murphy Guyer as Sergeant Detweiler Michael Rispoli as Grama Martin Landau as Judge Abe Petrovsky Gretchen Mol as Jo Bill Yeagle as Russian Thug Melina Kanakaredes as Barbara Josh Mostel as Zagosh Tom Aldredge as Judge Marinacci Michael Lombard as District Attorney Shields Lenny Clarke as Savino Chris Messina as Higgins Goran Višnjić as Maurice David Zayas as Trooper Osborne Johnny Chan as himself Bill Camp as Eisenberg Josh Pais as Weitz Adam LeFevre as Sean Frye Turturro's character was based on underground poker player Joel \"Bagels\" Rosenberg Production Principal photography for Rounders began in December 1997; it took place mostly in New York City. Exceptions include the law school scenes (filmed at Rutgers School of Law-Newark) and the State Trooper poker game and parking lot scenes (filmed at the B.P.O Elks Lodge in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey). Soundtrack The soundtrack features the song \"Baby, I'm a Big Star Now\" by Counting Crows. The song plays during the end credits, and appeared as a bonus track in the UK version of the album Saturday Nights & Sunday Mornings. Reception Box office Rounders was released on September 11, 1998, in 2,176 theaters and grossed $8.5 million during its opening weekend. It went on to make $22.9 million domestically. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 64% based on 81 reviews, with an average score of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Richly atmospheric and colorful performances contributed to the movie's entertainment value.\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 54 out of 100 based on 32 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B−\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four and wrote: \"Rounders sometimes has a noir look but it never has a noir feel, because it's not about losers (or at least it doesn't admit it is). It's essentially a sports picture, in which the talented hero wins, loses, faces disaster, and then is paired off one last time against the champ.\" In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote: \"Though John Dahl's Rounders finally adds up to less than meets the eye, what does meet the eye (and ear) is mischievously entertaining.\" USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and wrote: \"The card playing is well-staged, and even those who don't know a Texas hold-'em ('the Cadillac of poker') from a Texas hoedown will get a vicarious charge out of the action.\" Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"B\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \"Norton, cast in what might have once been the Sean Penn role (hideous shirts, screw-you attitude), gives Worm a shifty, amphetamine soul and a pleasing alacrity ... Norton's performance never really goes anywhere, but that's okay, since the story is just an excuse to lead the characters from one poker table to the next.\" Peter Travers, in his review for Rolling Stone said of John Malkovich's performance: \"Of course, no one could guess the extent to which Malkovich is now capable of chewing scenery. He surpasses even his eyeballrolling as Cyrus the Virus in Con Air. Munching Oreo cookies, splashing the pot with chips (a poker no-no) and speaking with a Russian accent that defies deciphering ('Ho-kay, Meester sum of a beech'), Malkovich soars so far over the top, he's passing Pluto.\" In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle said of Damon's performance: \"Mike should supply the drive the film otherwise lacks, and Damon doesn't. We might believe he can play cards, but we don't believe he needs to do it, in the way, say, that the 12-year-old Mozart needed to write symphonies. He's not consumed with genius. He's a nice guy with a skill.\" In his review for The Globe and Mail, Liam Lacey wrote: \"The main problem with Rounders is that the movie never quite knows what it is about: What is the moral ante?\" Despite an unremarkable theatrical release, Rounders has a following, particularly among poker enthusiasts. There are pro poker players who credit the film for getting them into the game. The film drew in successful players such as Brian Rast, Hevad Khan, Gavin Griffin, and Dutch Boyd. Vanessa Rousso has said of the film's influence: \"There have been lots of movies that have included poker, but only Rounders really captures the energy and tension in the game. And that's why it stands as the best poker movie ever made.\"",

Until that time, Nevada’s governors and their families found lodging where they could.  State Assembly Bill 10, the “Mansion Bill,” was passed in 1907 to secure a permanent site and residence for Nevada’s First Families.  The land where the mansion stands was generously offered by Mrs. T.B. Rickey for the sum of $10. Reno architect George A. Ferris designed the mansion and the construction bid was awarded at $22,700. The mansion was first occupied in July 1909 by Acting Governor Denver Dickerson and his family, and first opened to the public during an open house on New Years’ Day, 1910.\nThe commanding Classical Revival building features Georgian and Jeffersonian motifs, first seen in the central placement of the main entry. The elegant two-story pediment portico is supported by fluted Ionic columns, as is the second-story porch that wraps around the building’s front facade. The window moldings employ Greek revival motifs. On the interior, the first floor contains the grand entry hall, the reception room, a formal dining room, the governor’s study, luncheon room and the kitchen. The upstairs contains the private living quarters for the governor’s family. The mansion was structurally rehabilitated and redecorated from 1967 to 1968.

Rickey and his wife donated the land for the Governor’s Mansion just north of their residence.  A committee examined a number of locations in and around Carson City; many for sale and some were free for the asking.  Prices ranged from $500 to $4,000. The committee finally decided on the site offered by Mr. and Mrs. T.B. Rickey for the sum of $10. The story goes that Mrs. Rickey waited till her husband was out of town before offering the property for a Governor’s Mansion to the committee. When T.B. Rickey returned it was impossible for him to renegade on the donation since he received so much positive community support for his wife’s generous gift.\nStop 11: Krebs-Peterson House (1914) at 500 N.

King St.\nWhat seems to have been Nevada’s first brewery was established in Carson City by John Wagner & Company in 1860 during the rush to Virginia City.  By the time Nevada achieved statehood in 1864, business was booming, and a new two-story brewery was erected on the corner of South Division and West King Streets, where it still stands.  The lower floor housed the brewery operation and a bar and the upper floor served the Masonic lodge from 1864 until 1916, as their Lodge Hall.\nThe Carson Brewery specialized in steam beer, a bottom-fermenting brew produced without the constant cold temperatures that true lager requires.  The pure, clear water used in the brewing process came from King’s Canyon Creek west of town.  Hops and barley were imported from California and other outlying areas.  In January, 1863, the brewery produced ninety barrels of beer, and by the end of the month, all the barrels were sold.  Business was very good that year, with more than 500 barrels of beer being sold at $3 per gallon.\nStop 28: Ferris House (1869) at 311 W. 3\nrd\nSt.\nIn 1868, George Washington Gale Ferris, Sr. purchased the residence of Mary A. and Gregory A. Sears, who subdivided a portion of early Carson City, and built this house in 1863. The Sears–Ferris House is a square, frame building measuring approximately 60 feet by 60 feet, and combines Greek, Gothic Revival and Classical Revival influences. Ferris came to Nevada with his family in 1864 as a gentleman farmer. In addition to producing typical crops, Ferris planted numerous varieties of trees and was responsible for importing large numbers of Eastern ornamental trees to Carson City including hickory, black walnut and chestnut. Many of Ferris’s imported trees still adorn the\nCapitol\ngrounds.\nGeorge Washington Gale Ferris, Jr., who became the most prominent figure associated with the house, was a young boy when the family moved from their homestead in Carson Valley to this house in Carson City. Ferris was born in Galesburg, Illinois, in 1859. He graduated from military school in Oakland, California, and in 1881 graduated in engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. By 1892 young Ferris Jr. was associated with railroad and coal interests in the east, and became a bridge-builder and organizer of G. W. G. Ferris & Company in Pittsburgh. He and other American engineers had been challenged to build something “which would rival the Eiffel Tower” for the World’s Colombian Exposition of 1893.\nInfo from www.nps.gov/nr/travel/nevada/sea.html.\nStop 29: First Presbyterian Church (1864) at 100 N. Nevada St.\nFirst Presbyterian Church, completed in 1864, the brick edifice is considered to be the oldest Presbyterian Church in service in Nevada.\nStop 30: Olcovich-Meyers House (1874) at 214 King St.\nThe house was built by Joseph1 Olcovich in 1874-1875. He was the first brother to arrive in Carson in 1860, and started the Olcovich brothers business in 1863. Bernard “Ben” Olcovich purchased the home one year later in 1876. The Olcovich brothers were prominent members of the Jewish community and owned extensive commercial property in Carson. In addition to the family store at the corner of Fourth and Carson streets, they owned the Sazarac Saloon, a drug store, a jewelry store and a Chinese washhouse in downtown Carson.  As business declined during the 1890s the Olcovich brothers began to move away. Joseph moved to San Francisco, Hyman settled in Denver and Bernard went to Los Angeles. It appears that Bernard Olcovich rented the home to George Meyers from 1885 until he sold it to him around 1900.\nJoseph Olcovich was twenty-nine years of age at the time the home was built. He was single, but married Hattie in 1877. They had two children, Viola and Bennie.\nThere were four Olcovich brothers – Joseph, Bernard, Hyman and Herman. The first Olcovich family home in Carson City was located at the corner of Fourth and Curry, just down the block from their dry goods store at the corner of Fourth and Carson. In 1877, Hyman Olcovich built a home at 412 North Curry Street.\nBernard Olcovich was thirty-six when he moved into the King Street residence in 1876. He married Carrie in 1872 and they had five children: Pauline, Jacob, Emil, Albert and Clarisse.\nStop 31: Meder House (1875) 308 N. Nevada St.\nThe Lou eder house is a great example of the Italianate style of architecture. It’s unique for this style to only have one story instead of two or three.\nStop 32: Abraham Curry House (1871) at 406 N. Nevada St.\nAbe Curry built this house in 1871 of sandstone quarried from the Nevada State Prison.  Originally the house had an octagonal cupola, which served as a skylight for the dining room of the house.  There was also a front porch of five-bays in front of the projecting front pavilion which returned against the walls of the main block.\nCurry, one of the founders of Carson City, was born about 1814 in New York.  He came to Carson County, Utah Territory in 1858 and in 1859 located a claim on the Comstock Lode, later incorporated as a part of the Gould and Curry mine.  Curry was warden and contractor for the Nevada Territorial Prison from 1862 to 1864, territorial assemblyman 1862-1863, territorial senator 1863 to 1864, Orsmby county surveyor 1866-1869, superintendent of construction of U.S. Mint at Carson City 1866-1869, and first superintendent of the mint 1869-1871.  Curry’s last major local construction job was the V&T’s Carson City shops.  On October 19, 1873, Curry died at the age of fifty-eight.  His funeral was the largest held up to that time in Carson City and the Mint ceased operations for the day out of respect to its first superintendent.  He is buried in Lone Mountain Cemetery.\nStop 33: Chartz House (1876) at 412 N. Nevada St.\nThis Structure, with its elaborately roofed bays and matching entry, was built in 1876 by Frank Campbell who sold it to John Elliott, a prominent lumberman.  Alfred Chartz, a lawyer, although neither the builder nor the first owner, was the most noted personage associated with the house.  Chartz, who as a young news reporter shot a man who impugned his editor’s honor, had been sentenced to life in the state prison.  After winning a pardon he became one of Nevada’s outstanding lawyers in the field of water and mining adjudication.  The Chartz family resided in the house from 1894 to 1971.\nStop 34: Brougher-Bath Mansion (1903) at 204 W. Spear St.\nWilson Brougher “struck it rich” in the Tonopah boom in 1901 and came to Carson city when he purchased the Arlington Hotel located on North Carson Street. He built his home in 1903-1904 immediately behind the hotel and the mansion is named for him.\nWilson “Wilse” Brougher was born in Pennsylvania. He came to Nevada from Iowa about 1875, when he was twenty-one years old, he worked as a woodchopper and charcoal burner. Later he became a merchant.  In 1886 he was elected sheriff of Nye County on the Republican ticket, serving two terms.  Then he was elected county recorder and auditor, serving in that capacity for twelve years, 1890-1902. He was elected Ormsby County state senator in 1902 and served in the 1903 and 1905 legislative sessions. At the expiration of his term he withdrew from politics and devoted his time to mining and other interests. In 1902 he bought the Arlington Hotel in Carson City and moved there. At the time of his death he was a large landholder in Pahrump Valley in southern Nye County. He was successful in drilling for water and had one of the first pumping plants in the valley. Brougher died in Oakland in May, 1922.\nConstruction commenced in early August 1903, when ground was broken for the foundation. This necessitated a team and scraper; and they worked steadily for several days to prepare the site. The plans called for a basement that housed the heating boilers for the home and it was necessary to excavate to quite a depth. Henry Elliott had the contract for the stonework, and considerable granite was quarried at Lake View.\nIn January, 1926, the Brougher Mansion was threatened by fire. Senator and Mrs. Charles s. Sprague were leasing it. A stove pipe leading from one room to another became red hot and the partition through which it passed caught fire. The blaze was quickly extinguished by the Warren Engine Company.\nErnest H. Bath purchased the mansion in 1936. He was born in Carson City on September 27, 1883, the son of Henry and Sarah Bath. He was educated in the Carson public schools and at the Carson Business College. Ernest married Dora Doty of Lionville, California on June 12, 1909; they had three daughters: Irene Frances, Martha E, and Ruth Mary. Ernest worked in merchandising in Carson City until 1904, then for a railroad company in California from 1904-1915. He returned to Carson City and got into the fuel business, where he remained until 1935, when he was appointed postmaster of Carson City.\nStop 35: Hyman Olcovich House (1876) at 412 N. Curry St.\nThis house was built by Hyman Olcovich in approximately 1876-1877. The Olcovich brothers came to this country from Prussia.  They operated a dry goods store at the corner of Fourth and Carson Streets.  Hyman was married to his wife Pauline in 1867 and was thirty-eight years old when the house was built. They had seven children: Henrietta, Jacob, Annie, Louis, Nevada, Issac and Selig. The Olcovich family was one of the many Jewish families that settled in Carson City and practiced Judaism in their homes. In 1873, a rite of circumcision was performed upon Hyman Olcovich’s baby son, Louis. He was eight days old when Rabbi Sheyer performed the ceremony at the Olcovich home.\nA feast was held after the ceremony; the finest wines were served and the food for the occasion was brought from San Francisco for the celebration.  The Hyman Olcovich family was also involved in journalism in Carson City. Isaac and Selig Olcovich published “The Sun,” a small semiweekly “story paper” from June 1889 through July 1891. The paper was well patronized by friends and the community. What is remarkable about this is the fact that the boys were only thirteen and ten years of age. They stopped publishing The Sun in 1891 and began printing The Weekly. The paper, measuring 5 and one-half by eight inches and containing four pages was published Monday at a The Olcovich Brothers carried such i terns as clothing, boots, shoes, men’s furnishings, carpets, and house furnishings.  There were four brothers who owned and operated the store: Joseph, Hyman, Bernard and Herman.\nStop 36: Original Warren Engine Company (1863) at 201 N. Curry St.\nThe structure was built in 1863 of locally quarried sandstone.  The Warren Engine Company No. 1 was first organized at a meeting held on June 17, 1863. Among the founding members were Augustus Lewis, John Q.A. Moore, George A. Tyrell, and Edward D. Sweeney. Some thirty charter members eager to give Carson City a real fire department met enthusiastic support from their fellow townspeople and collected $2,000 following the meeting.  With the money they bought their first piece of fire equipment, a used Hunneman hand pumper originally owned by the Warren Engine co. of Boston and then by a disbanded fire company in Marysville, California.\nThe new Carson group named themselves after the Warrens of Boston. The Warren boys filled their depleted treasury by giving a benefit ball. Residents turned out in numbers for the cause, paying six dollars for dancing and a supper furnished by the ladies of the town, and for seeing the volunteers for the first time in full uniform.\nTheir first fire occurred after midnight at the Young America Saloon. An entire block was lost, and it was not an auspicious beginning.  The Hunneman engine eventually proved well worth its cost, but a second fire was so long in coming that the bored firefighters put on a demonstration of its powers at the Plaza where the Capitol now stands. While the crowd watched, the pumper threw a stream of water for a distance of 209 horizontal feet through a seven-eighths inch nozzle using 100 feet of hose. Its vertical stream reached 155 feet.\nA fire in a small community in the 1860s was a major event, and a one alarm or “one bell” fire was enough to bring out the whole community. A more serious conflagration got every bell in town ringing, a rather loud affair. In 1865, a block of downtown Carson was destroyed with damage estimated at $25,000. Flames also engulfed the Nevada State Prison in 1867, burning down all but the newer wing of the building.  In addition to the spectacular blaze that swept through the Carson & Tahoe Lumber and Fluming Company’s wood yard south of town in 1877, some of the most noteworthy early fires were Moore & Parker’s Hall in 1875, numerous blazes in Chinatown, Doc Benton’s Livery stable fire in 1902 and the Carson Opera House fire in 1931.\nWith the patronage of Carson City founder Abe Curry, another fire company was organized on April 20, 1864. Curry Engine Co. No. 2 purchased the former Knickerbocker No. 5 engine from San Francisco and would soon house it in a substantial stone firehouse built by Curry, which stands today at the corner of Curry and Musser Streets.\nStop 37: Rinckel Mansion (1876) at 102 N. Curry St.\nRinckel passed away in 1879, but his widow and children continued to occupy the mansion until her death in 1933. Their daughter, Louise Rinckel, married George Blakeslee of Tonopah, and they resided in the house until 1960. After 1941, when the mansion was featured in a Paramount Pictures film,\nThe Remarkable Andrew\n, the Blakeslee’s operated their home as a private museum. After Louise’s death, Ronald Machado ran the museum until 1968. Today it is one of the best remaining examples of high-style Victorian architecture in the American West.\nStop 38: E.D. Sweeney Building (1864) at 102 S. Curry St.\nThis is one of the earliest commercial buildings in Carson City, and one of the few brick buildings remaining from the City’s earliest years.  The house was built in 1864 by builder Peter Cavanaugh, who also constructed the Nevada State Capitol building in 1870.  Sweeney, who was important in establishing the town Carson City as a commercially vital town, erected the building to house shops on the ground floor and offices or apartments above.  In 1885 and 1890, the building housed a saloon and offices.  In 1907, the building was vacant.  The building also served for a time as the Post Office.\nSweeney helped in the effort to ensure the new state capitol would be built in Carson City by donating land for Federal and State buildings.  Sam Davis in his History of Nevada paid tribute to Sweeney as a “constructive, energetic and patriotic citizen, generous to a fault and had the respect and esteem of all who knew him.  He was in a true sense an empire builder, and possessed an indomitable will and courage which enabled him to surmount the many obstacles in his way.\nStop 39:\nBank Saloon – Formerly Jack’s Bar (1859)\n408 S. Carson St.\nThe entrance is located on the truncated southeast corner of the building, having a single door with a glass upper plate surrounded by sidelights and a transom light.  The east facade originally had large windows in each of its two bays. These have been reduced in height to about half their original size. The windows and the entryway are bordered by cast-iron pilasters. An oval medallion at the base of the columns states they were made by “U.I. Works – Reno, Nev – J. Michael – PRO.” The middle section of the columns contains arrows and rods, the capitol having an egg and dart motif above a rosette.  The south facade has six openings: two single panel doors with transom lights and four double-hung, one over one, windows. The west facade has a single door and window.  The interior of the structure has been little changed over the years. The back bar is not original. It was moved from another bar in Carson City in 1920. Except for two small storage rooms and two restrooms, the interior consists of a single room. An earlier intrusive partition has been removed. The building retains the original narrow tongue and groove ceiling boards.  This building is an example of the Victorian functional style, popular from the 1870s to the 1990s.\nJack’s Bar is being nominated as the representative of a class of establishments that have played a vital role in the social and political atmosphere of Carson City, essentially a small rural community that enjoys the honor of being Nevada’s capitol.  Used as a convenient meeting spots, with a relaxing environment to conduct business, talk politics, or discuss community life in general.  The proximity of Jack’s Bar to the offices of state government (opposite the Nevada State Capitol and Legislative Building) has resulted in its playing a very particular role in political affairs. The Bar has served as the site of informal meetings and caucuses that have had an effect on the political history of the state.\nStop 40:\nSt. Charles-Muller Hotel (1862) 302 S. Carson St.\nConstructed in 1862, one of the first hotels in Carson City was also one of the state’s most elegant and became the main stage stop in Carson City. It consists of two utilitarian buildings, a two-story one on the south and a three-story one on the north, each with Italianate details. The St. Charles-Muller’s Hotel is one of the oldest remaining commercial buildings in Carson City, and the second oldest hotel in the state. The northern portion of the building, the St. Charles Hotel, was started on April Fool’s Day 1862.\nThe St. Charles, named after well-reputed hotels back East, was billed by its builders as a first-class hotel, “the pleasantest resort in Carson and where everything kept by the bar is the best quality.” The builders also realized the potential profits from operating a hotel oriented to members of the second Territorial Session of the Nevada legislature and arranged for the stage coaches to stop at the St. Charles first upon arrival in Carson City. Construction of the southern section began in May 1862 for Muller’s Hotel, which was consequently marketed toward working-class clientele.\nBecause the operators of Muller’s Hotel were French, a baker and his wife (a skilled cook who ran the restaurant), a large core of French Canadian woodcutters who were in the region to cut wood for the mines in Virginia City, lodged there. The two buildings were rehabilitated in 1992 and operated together as the St. Charles Hotel until recently.\nIt is actually a combination of two hotels, the old St. Charles and the Muller Hotel which adjoins it on the south.  Its current name is the fifth one to adorn the hotel since it began in 1862.  Starting as the St. Charles and Muller Hotel, the building has been known as the Briggs House, Golden West Hotel, Traveler’s Hotel and finally, the Pony Express.\nInfo from www.nps.gov/nr/travel/nevada/stc.htm.\nStop 41: Capitol Complex\nToday, the capitol complex in the heart of Carson City provides a picturesque campus setting which includes the State Capitol, Legislative Building, Supreme Court, and State Library and Archives. What was once a dusty, sometimes muddy, pit in the middle of a growing frontier town, is now lush with native plant species and buildings of impressive architectural detail.\nWhen the ambitious founders of Carson City laid out the town in 1858, they had dreams of a new territory, and then a new state to follow. Ten acres, known as the Plaza, was set aside in the belief that Carson City would be chosen as the capital of a new government in western Utah Territory.\nThe demands of the Civil War pushed the creation of the Nevada Territory in 1861 and the territorial legislature selected the fledgling community of Carson City as its capital.\nIn that first decade, the Plaza remained empty. Statehood in 1864 saw Carson City become the state capital of Nevada, but the constitutional convention made a provision that no state capitol would be built until after three legislative sessions had passed. Some people still believed that the capital would be moved to a more central location in the new state.\nFortunately, that did not happen. The building was commissioned in 1869 and built the following year. Additions, including the breezeway-connected library, and, in 1913, wings on the north and south sides, have significantly changed the building’s look.\nStop 42: Nevada State Capitol Building (1870) at 101 N. Carson St.\nFacts: Architect’s fee: $250; stone: free, from State Prison quarry. (1870-71)\nNow, more than 130 years later, the building is still used, standing as a testament to the foresight of Nevada’s founding fathers. Other grand Carson City buildings surround the capitol, marking the incredible growth of Nevada’s capital city. But the capitol building, constructed of native sandstone, holds the special designation of the second oldest capitol building west of the Mississippi River.\nStop 43: Hero’s Memorial Building (1921) at 198 N. Carson St.\nThe Carson City Public Buildings is a governmental complex of three buildings—the Heroes Memorial Building, Ormsby County Courthouse and Nevada Supreme Court—designed by architect Frederic DeLongchamps (1882-1969). DeLongchamps maintained an architectural practice in Reno from 1907 to 1965. During his career, the architect was responsible for the design of more than 500 public, commercial and residential buildings, the majority of which were constructed in his native state of Nevada. The son of French Canadian immigrants, DeLongchamps was born in Reno on June 2, 1882. He received a degree in mining engineering from the University of Nevada-Reno in 1904, and after briefly pursuing a mining career and working in the U.S. Surveyor’s Office, he moved to San Francisco in 1906 and served as an architect’s apprentice. One year later, he returned to Reno and established an architectural firm with a colleague from the Surveyor’s Office, and together they won commissions for approximately 30 buildings between 1907 and 1909. He began his solo career in 1909 when he won the design competition for the\nWashoe County Courthouse\n. Throughout his career he favored stone, brick and terra cotta as building materials, enlivening facades by using contrasting stone colors in a variety of patterns.\nDeLongchamps holds the distinction of being the only person to serve as Nevada’s State Architect. He was appointed to the position on April 10, 1919, and served for two years until the post was temporarily abolished, then reappointed in 1923 and served until the position was permanently abolished in 1926. While holding this office, DeLongchamps began the development of the governmental complex in Carson City across the street from the\nNevada State Capitol\n. The three buildings dramatically illustrate the evolution of the architect’s public architecture between the 1920s and 1930s. The twin Heroes Memorial Building (1921) and Ormsby County Courthouse (1920-1922) were designed while DeLongchamps was serving as State Architect, and are monumental, Neo-Classical buildings. Both buildings have large pediment porticos supported by four Doric columns. The Heroes Memorial Building was designed as “a fitting memorial to Nevada Soldiers who gave their lives in the service of the United States in the European War” (World War I).\nA decade later, when the Supreme Court had outgrown its single-room quarters in the Capitol, DeLongchamps was awarded the commission for a new building, which he designed in a compatible but distinctly Modern style. Today the Heroes Memorial Building and Supreme Courthouse the Nevada Attorney General’s Office. The Ormsby County Courthouse housed the Carson City (formerly Ormsby County) courts until 1999 when it was acquired by the State, and it is currently being remodeled for use by the Nevada State Attorney General’s office as well. Although not listed in the National Register of Historic Places, of interest is the granite fountain in front of the Supreme Court, presented to Carson City in 1909 by the National Humane Alliance to provide fresh water for passing horses and pets. Water pours out of small bronze lions heads with open mouths into a large drinking bowl for horses, mounted four feet off the ground, and small cups are located at the base for dogs and cats.\nInfo from www.nps.gov/nr/travel/nevada/pub.htm.\nStop 44: Former Nevada Supreme Court & State Library (1936) at 198 N.

Carson St.\nThe Kitzmeyer Furniture Factory is the oldest surviving Italianate-style, commercial building in Carson City.  It was found to be the most intact example of Italianate-style architecture associated with the commercial development of the late 19th century Carson City.\nThe Daily Appeal went on to report that the owners of the kiln had turned about 600,000 bricks in 1873.\nThe building housed a first-story furniture and housewares showroom and a second-story furniture factory.  Kitzmeyer had originally intended to build a three-story building, but ended up building only a two-story structure.\nIt was common for furniture makers to also make coffins as a line of “furniture,” the Kitzmeyers began an undertaking business in building and eventually expanding to Virginia City and Gardnerville.\nStop 47: Paul Laxalt Building (1891) at 401 N. Carson St.\nPressed red brick with extensive detail, wide arched windows, bays and an arcaded entrance decorated with carved sandstone, all add to the picturesque composition of the building.  The Victorian-style building was designed by Mifflin E. Bell, a prominent 19\nth\n-century federal government architect who also was responsible for post offices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Brooklyn, New York.  As with many of his other structures, Bell included an unusual three-faced clock in a 106-foot tower on the Carson City building’s northwest corner.\nThe Clock, which was made by Joseph Barborka Company of Iowa, runs on a lengthy weight system that extends four stories and must be wound by hand every ten days.\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, the building had Carson City’s first elevator, a three-story model that was installed in 1935.\nThe Nevada Commission on Tourism building was built in 1877 for the Carson City Opera House until it was purchased for the purpose of building the U.S. Courthouse and Post Office.\nSeptember 29, 1888 is when the cornerstone was laid.  Embedded inside the cornerstone is a silk handkerchief wrapped around a document from the first Masonic meeting describing the devastating 1875 fire that virtually destroyed Virginia City.  Officiating at the ceremony was Judge Thomas P. Hawley, the first presiding U.S. District Judge.\nOn May 19, 1891 the structure was completed at the cost of $134,605.53.  The building was occupied by the Post Office, Land Office, U.S. Courts, and the Weather Bureau.  In all, sixteen rooms were assigned to various agencies.  The building was topped by a 106-foot tall clock tower.  The four-story, redbrick landmark was Nevada’s first federal building.\nStop 48:\nForeman-Roberts House Museum (1863) 1207 N. Carson St.\nThe Gothic Revival Style Foreman-Roberts House was built in Old Washoe City, Utah Territory in 1863 by Solomon W. Foreman.\nIn 1867, it was sold to James D. Roberts and in 1874 was moved to 1207 N. Carson Street in Carson City.\nJames D. Roberts fought in the 1860 Pyramid Lake Indian War.

Carson St.\nThe Mint was created in 1863, but not put into operation until 1870, at the peak of the silver boom. More than $49 million worth of silver and gold coins bearing the famous CC mark was coined here until the mint was shut down in 1893. It became the Nevada State Museum in 1939, a must see attraction in Carson City.\nStop 2: Cavell House (1907) at 402 W. Robinson St.\nThis house is virtually identical to the Esser House located at 306 S. Minnesota, and it was designed by the same architect, John Conant.  The Esser House, however, was built shortly before the Cavell home in 1907.  The Cavell’s liked Conant’s design for the Esser’s so they purchased the plans for it.  The design was considered advanced for the times, with low ceilings, gas and electric fixtures and hot water heater.\nWilliam Henry Cavell was considered the leading dentist of Carson City during the period 1896 to 1952.  He was born September 11, 1869, in Carson City.  His father, John Cavell, was born in England and came to the United States at the age of two; he arrived in Carson City in 1861 and was employed as a painter.  Cavell’s mother’s maiden name was Grace Wren and she was also born in England.\nWhen William Henry Cavell was seven, the family moved to Modesto, California.  He was educated in the public schools there and graduated from the University of California, School of Dentistry in 1895.  After his graduation, Dr. Cavell returned to Carson City and began to practice dentistry which he continued to do for fifty-six years.  His office was located in the Bullion and Exchange Bank building on North Carson Street.  In the early 1900’s, Dr. Cavell was successful in buying and selling mining stock during the Tonopah boom.  During his professional career he built up an enviable practice and was considered one of Carson’s steadfast businessmen.  He retired at the age of 84 in 1952.\nStop 3: Yerington House (1863) at 512 N. Division St.\nThe original central section of this house was built in 1863 by lawyer Thomas Haydon.  The property was deeded to Mrs. Yerington in the fall of 1869, and the Yerington’s made numerous additions.  Among its elegant features were an imported marble fireplace and a solarium with its arched windows which is reminiscent of railroad observation car.\nThe Yerington family held the house until 1920.  During the 1950’s George B.

Yerington and Dave Bender of the V&T.  When it was completed it was the largest home in Nevada.\nThe home was built on ground that had once been an Indian camping site and burial ground.  When workmen were removing bodies before construction started it became clear that the site had also been used by whites as an early burial site.\nFor six months Duane Bliss gathered materials to build a stately home, using the most perfect lumber cut from the Bliss forests.  He built the mansion with clear sugar pine and cedar from his own Lake Tahoe lumber mill.  A great foundation of locally-quarried sandstone was started early in 1879, and by November, the house was occupied.  In his diary, Bliss noted that he could acquire two million dollars through the channels of trade more easily than he could build this home.\nIncluded in its twenty-one rooms were bathrooms, formal dining room, game room, parlor, butler’s pantry, linen rooms, nine bedrooms and a kitchen.  With cathedral ceilings, the house measured 7,057 square feet.  It was one of the first homes in the West to be piped for gas lighting and continued to be a center for growing Bliss operations.\nStop 9: Governor’s Mansion (1909) at 606 N. Mountain St.\nFacts: Land costs $10.  Completed after 30 years of debate between (1908-09).\nNevada was proclaimed a territory in 1861, and a state in 1864, but the Governor’s Mansion was not built until more than 40 years later between 1908 and 1909. Until that time, Nevada’s governors and their families found lodging where they could.  State Assembly Bill 10, the “Mansion Bill,” was passed in 1907 to secure a permanent site and residence for Nevada’s First Families.  The land where the mansion stands was generously offered by Mrs. T.B. Rickey for the sum of $10. Reno architect George A. Ferris designed the mansion and the construction bid was awarded at $22,700. The mansion was first occupied in July 1909 by Acting Governor Denver Dickerson and his family, and first opened to the public during an open house on New Years’ Day, 1910.\nThe commanding Classical Revival building features Georgian and Jeffersonian motifs, first seen in the central placement of the main entry. The elegant two-story pediment portico is supported by fluted Ionic columns, as is the second-story porch that wraps around the building’s front facade. The window moldings employ Greek revival motifs. On the interior, the first floor contains the grand entry hall, the reception room, a formal dining room, the governor’s study, luncheon room and the kitchen. The upstairs contains the private living quarters for the governor’s family. The mansion was structurally rehabilitated and redecorated from 1967 to 1968.

Rickey and his wife donated the land for the Governor’s Mansion just north of their residence.  A committee examined a number of locations in and around Carson City; many for sale and some were free for the asking.  Prices ranged from $500 to $4,000. The committee finally decided on the site offered by Mr. and Mrs. T.B. Rickey for the sum of $10. The story goes that Mrs. Rickey waited till her husband was out of town before offering the property for a Governor’s Mansion to the committee. When T.B. Rickey returned it was impossible for him to renegade on the donation since he received so much positive community support for his wife’s generous gift.\nStop 11: Krebs-Peterson House (1914) at 500 N. Mountain St.\nDr. Ernest T. Krebs, Sr., was a physician and surgeon who came to Carson City from Tonopah around 1906.  Before building his home on Mountain Street in 1914, Dr. Krebs leased the fine Kitzmeyer home on Telegraph Street.  He made his rounds with a horse and buggy and he was known as a “free thinker with a fighting spirit.”\nDuring WWI a terrible flu epidemic hit this area and much of the United States.  Dr. Krebs achieved international fame in halting the influenza epidemic in the vicinity of Carson City through the use of the sacred herbs of a local Native-American tribe.  He had discovered that the herbs gave immunity to colds and infections.\nThe Victorian two-story home has oval stained glass windows on either side of the front door.  A wide veranda extends across the parlor and the front entries are made out of red oak.  Burd Lindsey, a well-known Carson City resident, was the finish carpenter on the house; he crafted the red oak stairway.  Each of the three bedrooms has its own washbasin.  The bathroom has a unique round water closet.  The fireplace in the back parlor is composed of field stone from the ranch of Charles Schulz, Edna Carrington’s grandfather; the ranch is now the site of the prison farm.\nThe Krebs-Peterson home was chosen to be the boardinghouse for John Wayne in his last days as a dying gunfighter in “The Shootists.” The filming began in January 1976, and lasted a little less than a month.  The front parlor was the only room used during the filming.  In the final moments of the film, Lauren Bacall stood at the window and watched Wayne walk down the steps to catch the trolley on his way to the shoot-out.  The exterior of the house was used extensively during the filming.\nStop 12: Robinson House (1874) at 406 North Mountain St.\nThis house was built in 1873 by Marshall Robinson, one of the founders of the Carson Daily Appeal.  On May 16, 1865, E F.

He did resign his office as clerk in 1877, when he was appointed clerk of the United States District Court. This event took place five years before Edwards built his new home on North Minnesota. The story about the use of prison labor has with time become a very popular legend, but the evidence clearly shows there was no scandal associated with the construction of the home.\nThomas J. “Tom” Edwards was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan on November 2, 1840. He came to Nevada in 1862 and settled in the milling town of Ophir, where he was a bookkeeper for the Ophir Milling Company.

Russell, who was married to his daughter Ann, took over the house after his death. Russell was a newspaperman and also served as state treasurer from 1927 until 1935.  Russell kept on to the house until 1960, when he sold it to his nephew, former Governor Charles Hinton Russell and his wife Marjorie.

In addition to the family store at the corner of Fourth and Carson streets, they owned the Sazarac Saloon, a drug store, a jewelry store and a Chinese washhouse in downtown Carson.  As business declined during the 1890s the Olcovich brothers began to move away. Joseph moved to San Francisco, Hyman settled in Denver and Bernard went to Los Angeles. It appears that Bernard Olcovich rented the home to George Meyers from 1885 until he sold it to him around 1900.\nJoseph Olcovich was twenty-nine years of age at the time the home was built. He was single, but married Hattie in 1877. They had two children, Viola and Bennie.\nThere were four Olcovich brothers – Joseph, Bernard, Hyman and Herman. The first Olcovich family home in Carson City was located at the corner of Fourth and Curry, just down the block from their dry goods store at the corner of Fourth and Carson. In 1877, Hyman Olcovich built a home at 412 North Curry Street.\nBernard Olcovich was thirty-six when he moved into the King Street residence in 1876. He married Carrie in 1872 and they had five children: Pauline, Jacob, Emil, Albert and Clarisse.\nStop 31: Meder House (1875) 308 N. Nevada St.\nThe Lou eder house is a great example of the Italianate style of architecture. It’s unique for this style to only have one story instead of two or three.\nStop 32: Abraham Curry House (1871) at 406 N. Nevada St.\nAbe Curry built this house in 1871 of sandstone quarried from the Nevada State Prison.  Originally the house had an octagonal cupola, which served as a skylight for the dining room of the house.  There was also a front porch of five-bays in front of the projecting front pavilion which returned against the walls of the main block.\nCurry, one of the founders of Carson City, was born about 1814 in New York.  He came to Carson County, Utah Territory in 1858 and in 1859 located a claim on the Comstock Lode, later incorporated as a part of the Gould and Curry mine.  Curry was warden and contractor for the Nevada Territorial Prison from 1862 to 1864, territorial assemblyman 1862-1863, territorial senator 1863 to 1864, Orsmby county surveyor 1866-1869, superintendent of construction of U.S. Mint at Carson City 1866-1869, and first superintendent of the mint 1869-1871.  Curry’s last major local construction job was the V&T’s Carson City shops.  On October 19, 1873, Curry died at the age of fifty-eight.  His funeral was the largest held up to that time in Carson City and the Mint ceased operations for the day out of respect to its first superintendent.  He is buried in Lone Mountain Cemetery.\nStop 33: Chartz House (1876) at 412 N. Nevada St.\nThis Structure, with its elaborately roofed bays and matching entry, was built in 1876 by Frank Campbell who sold it to John Elliott, a prominent lumberman.  Alfred Chartz, a lawyer, although neither the builder nor the first owner, was the most noted personage associated with the house.  Chartz, who as a young news reporter shot a man who impugned his editor’s honor, had been sentenced to life in the state prison.  After winning a pardon he became one of Nevada’s outstanding lawyers in the field of water and mining adjudication.  The Chartz family resided in the house from 1894 to 1971.\nStop 34: Brougher-Bath Mansion (1903) at 204 W. Spear St.\nWilson Brougher “struck it rich” in the Tonopah boom in 1901 and came to Carson city when he purchased the Arlington Hotel located on North Carson Street. He built his home in 1903-1904 immediately behind the hotel and the mansion is named for him.\nWilson “Wilse” Brougher was born in Pennsylvania. He came to Nevada from Iowa about 1875, when he was twenty-one years old, he worked as a woodchopper and charcoal burner. Later he became a merchant.  In 1886 he was elected sheriff of Nye County on the Republican ticket, serving two terms.  Then he was elected county recorder and auditor, serving in that capacity for twelve years, 1890-1902. He was elected Ormsby County state senator in 1902 and served in the 1903 and 1905 legislative sessions. At the expiration of his term he withdrew from politics and devoted his time to mining and other interests. In 1902 he bought the Arlington Hotel in Carson City and moved there. At the time of his death he was a large landholder in Pahrump Valley in southern Nye County. He was successful in drilling for water and had one of the first pumping plants in the valley. Brougher died in Oakland in May, 1922.\nConstruction commenced in early August 1903, when ground was broken for the foundation. This necessitated a team and scraper; and they worked steadily for several days to prepare the site. The plans called for a basement that housed the heating boilers for the home and it was necessary to excavate to quite a depth. Henry Elliott had the contract for the stonework, and considerable granite was quarried at Lake View.\nIn January, 1926, the Brougher Mansion was threatened by fire. Senator and Mrs. Charles s. Sprague were leasing it. A stove pipe leading from one room to another became red hot and the partition through which it passed caught fire. The blaze was quickly extinguished by the Warren Engine Company.\nErnest H. Bath purchased the mansion in 1936. He was born in Carson City on September 27, 1883, the son of Henry and Sarah Bath. He was educated in the Carson public schools and at the Carson Business College. Ernest married Dora Doty of Lionville, California on June 12, 1909; they had three daughters: Irene Frances, Martha E, and Ruth Mary. Ernest worked in merchandising in Carson City until 1904, then for a railroad company in California from 1904-1915. He returned to Carson City and got into the fuel business, where he remained until 1935, when he was appointed postmaster of Carson City.\nStop 35: Hyman Olcovich House (1876) at 412 N. Curry St.\nThis house was built by Hyman Olcovich in approximately 1876-1877. The Olcovich brothers came to this country from Prussia.  They operated a dry goods store at the corner of Fourth and Carson Streets.  Hyman was married to his wife Pauline in 1867 and was thirty-eight years old when the house was built. They had seven children: Henrietta, Jacob, Annie, Louis, Nevada, Issac and Selig. The Olcovich family was one of the many Jewish families that settled in Carson City and practiced Judaism in their homes. In 1873, a rite of circumcision was performed upon Hyman Olcovich’s baby son, Louis. He was eight days old when Rabbi Sheyer performed the ceremony at the Olcovich home.\nA feast was held after the ceremony; the finest wines were served and the food for the occasion was brought from San Francisco for the celebration.  The Hyman Olcovich family was also involved in journalism in Carson City. Isaac and Selig Olcovich published “The Sun,” a small semiweekly “story paper” from June 1889 through July 1891. The paper was well patronized by friends and the community. What is remarkable about this is the fact that the boys were only thirteen and ten years of age. They stopped publishing The Sun in 1891 and began printing The Weekly. The paper, measuring 5 and one-half by eight inches and containing four pages was published Monday at a The Olcovich Brothers carried such i terns as clothing, boots, shoes, men’s furnishings, carpets, and house furnishings.  There were four brothers who owned and operated the store: Joseph, Hyman, Bernard and Herman.\nStop 36: Original Warren Engine Company (1863) at 201 N. Curry St.\nThe structure was built in 1863 of locally quarried sandstone.  The Warren Engine Company No. 1 was first organized at a meeting held on June 17, 1863. Among the founding members were Augustus Lewis, John Q.A. Moore, George A. Tyrell, and Edward D. Sweeney. Some thirty charter members eager to give Carson City a real fire department met enthusiastic support from their fellow townspeople and collected $2,000 following the meeting.  With the money they bought their first piece of fire equipment, a used Hunneman hand pumper originally owned by the Warren Engine co. of Boston and then by a disbanded fire company in Marysville, California.\nThe new Carson group named themselves after the Warrens of Boston. The Warren boys filled their depleted treasury by giving a benefit ball. Residents turned out in numbers for the cause, paying six dollars for dancing and a supper furnished by the ladies of the town, and for seeing the volunteers for the first time in full uniform.\nTheir first fire occurred after midnight at the Young America Saloon. An entire block was lost, and it was not an auspicious beginning.  The Hunneman engine eventually proved well worth its cost, but a second fire was so long in coming that the bored firefighters put on a demonstration of its powers at the Plaza where the Capitol now stands. While the crowd watched, the pumper threw a stream of water for a distance of 209 horizontal feet through a seven-eighths inch nozzle using 100 feet of hose. Its vertical stream reached 155 feet.\nA fire in a small community in the 1860s was a major event, and a one alarm or “one bell” fire was enough to bring out the whole community. A more serious conflagration got every bell in town ringing, a rather loud affair. In 1865, a block of downtown Carson was destroyed with damage estimated at $25,000. Flames also engulfed the Nevada State Prison in 1867, burning down all but the newer wing of the building.  In addition to the spectacular blaze that swept through the Carson & Tahoe Lumber and Fluming Company’s wood yard south of town in 1877, some of the most noteworthy early fires were Moore & Parker’s Hall in 1875, numerous blazes in Chinatown, Doc Benton’s Livery stable fire in 1902 and the Carson Opera House fire in 1931.\nWith the patronage of Carson City founder Abe Curry, another fire company was organized on April 20, 1864. Curry Engine Co. No. 2 purchased the former Knickerbocker No. 5 engine from San Francisco and would soon house it in a substantial stone firehouse built by Curry, which stands today at the corner of Curry and Musser Streets.\nStop 37: Rinckel Mansion (1876) at 102 N. Curry St.\nRinckel passed away in 1879, but his widow and children continued to occupy the mansion until her death in 1933. Their daughter, Louise Rinckel, married George Blakeslee of Tonopah, and they resided in the house until 1960. After 1941, when the mansion was featured in a Paramount Pictures film,\nThe Remarkable Andrew\n, the Blakeslee’s operated their home as a private museum. After Louise’s death, Ronald Machado ran the museum until 1968. Today it is one of the best remaining examples of high-style Victorian architecture in the American West.\nStop 38: E.D. Sweeney Building (1864) at 102 S. Curry St.\nThis is one of the earliest commercial buildings in Carson City, and one of the few brick buildings remaining from the City’s earliest years.  The house was built in 1864 by builder Peter Cavanaugh, who also constructed the Nevada State Capitol building in 1870.  Sweeney, who was important in establishing the town Carson City as a commercially vital town, erected the building to house shops on the ground floor and offices or apartments above.  In 1885 and 1890, the building housed a saloon and offices.  In 1907, the building was vacant.  The building also served for a time as the Post Office.\nSweeney helped in the effort to ensure the new state capitol would be built in Carson City by donating land for Federal and State buildings.  Sam Davis in his History of Nevada paid tribute to Sweeney as a “constructive, energetic and patriotic citizen, generous to a fault and had the respect and esteem of all who knew him.  He was in a true sense an empire builder, and possessed an indomitable will and courage which enabled him to surmount the many obstacles in his way.\nStop 39:\nBank Saloon – Formerly Jack’s Bar (1859)\n408 S. Carson St.\nThe entrance is located on the truncated southeast corner of the building, having a single door with a glass upper plate surrounded by sidelights and a transom light.  The east facade originally had large windows in each of its two bays. These have been reduced in height to about half their original size. The windows and the entryway are bordered by cast-iron pilasters. An oval medallion at the base of the columns states they were made by “U.I. Works – Reno, Nev – J. Michael – PRO.” The middle section of the columns contains arrows and rods, the capitol having an egg and dart motif above a rosette.  The south facade has six openings: two single panel doors with transom lights and four double-hung, one over one, windows. The west facade has a single door and window.  The interior of the structure has been little changed over the years. The back bar is not original. It was moved from another bar in Carson City in 1920. Except for two small storage rooms and two restrooms, the interior consists of a single room. An earlier intrusive partition has been removed. The building retains the original narrow tongue and groove ceiling boards.  This building is an example of the Victorian functional style, popular from the 1870s to the 1990s.\nJack’s Bar is being nominated as the representative of a class of establishments that have played a vital role in the social and political atmosphere of Carson City, essentially a small rural community that enjoys the honor of being Nevada’s capitol.  Used as a convenient meeting spots, with a relaxing environment to conduct business, talk politics, or discuss community life in general.  The proximity of Jack’s Bar to the offices of state government (opposite the Nevada State Capitol and Legislative Building) has resulted in its playing a very particular role in political affairs. The Bar has served as the site of informal meetings and caucuses that have had an effect on the political history of the state.\nStop 40:\nSt. Charles-Muller Hotel (1862) 302 S. Carson St.\nConstructed in 1862, one of the first hotels in Carson City was also one of the state’s most elegant and became the main stage stop in Carson City. It consists of two utilitarian buildings, a two-story one on the south and a three-story one on the north, each with Italianate details. The St. Charles-Muller’s Hotel is one of the oldest remaining commercial buildings in Carson City, and the second oldest hotel in the state. The northern portion of the building, the St. Charles Hotel, was started on April Fool’s Day 1862.\nThe St. Charles, named after well-reputed hotels back East, was billed by its builders as a first-class hotel, “the pleasantest resort in Carson and where everything kept by the bar is the best quality.” The builders also realized the potential profits from operating a hotel oriented to members of the second Territorial Session of the Nevada legislature and arranged for the stage coaches to stop at the St. Charles first upon arrival in Carson City. Construction of the southern section began in May 1862 for Muller’s Hotel, which was consequently marketed toward working-class clientele.\nBecause the operators of Muller’s Hotel were French, a baker and his wife (a skilled cook who ran the restaurant), a large core of French Canadian woodcutters who were in the region to cut wood for the mines in Virginia City, lodged there. The two buildings were rehabilitated in 1992 and operated together as the St. Charles Hotel until recently.\nIt is actually a combination of two hotels, the old St. Charles and the Muller Hotel which adjoins it on the south.  Its current name is the fifth one to adorn the hotel since it began in 1862.  Starting as the St. Charles and Muller Hotel, the building has been known as the Briggs House, Golden West Hotel, Traveler’s Hotel and finally, the Pony Express.\nInfo from www.nps.gov/nr/travel/nevada/stc.htm.\nStop 41: Capitol Complex\nToday, the capitol complex in the heart of Carson City provides a picturesque campus setting which includes the State Capitol, Legislative Building, Supreme Court, and State Library and Archives. What was once a dusty, sometimes muddy, pit in the middle of a growing frontier town, is now lush with native plant species and buildings of impressive architectural detail.\nWhen the ambitious founders of Carson City laid out the town in 1858, they had dreams of a new territory, and then a new state to follow. Ten acres, known as the Plaza, was set aside in the belief that Carson City would be chosen as the capital of a new government in western Utah Territory.\nThe demands of the Civil War pushed the creation of the Nevada Territory in 1861 and the territorial legislature selected the fledgling community of Carson City as its capital.\nIn that first decade, the Plaza remained empty. Statehood in 1864 saw Carson City become the state capital of Nevada, but the constitutional convention made a provision that no state capitol would be built until after three legislative sessions had passed. Some people still believed that the capital would be moved to a more central location in the new state.\nFortunately, that did not happen. The building was commissioned in 1869 and built the following year. Additions, including the breezeway-connected library, and, in 1913, wings on the north and south sides, have significantly changed the building’s look.\nStop 42: Nevada State Capitol Building (1870) at 101 N. Carson St.\nFacts: Architect’s fee: $250; stone: free, from State Prison quarry. (1870-71)\nNow, more than 130 years later, the building is still used, standing as a testament to the foresight of Nevada’s founding fathers. Other grand Carson City buildings surround the capitol, marking the incredible growth of Nevada’s capital city. But the capitol building, constructed of native sandstone, holds the special designation of the second oldest capitol building west of the Mississippi River.\nStop 43: Hero’s Memorial Building (1921) at 198 N. Carson St.\nThe Carson City Public Buildings is a governmental complex of three buildings—the Heroes Memorial Building, Ormsby County Courthouse and Nevada Supreme Court—designed by architect Frederic DeLongchamps (1882-1969). DeLongchamps maintained an architectural practice in Reno from 1907 to 1965. During his career, the architect was responsible for the design of more than 500 public, commercial and residential buildings, the majority of which were constructed in his native state of Nevada. The son of French Canadian immigrants, DeLongchamps was born in Reno on June 2, 1882. He received a degree in mining engineering from the University of Nevada-Reno in 1904, and after briefly pursuing a mining career and working in the U.S. Surveyor’s Office, he moved to San Francisco in 1906 and served as an architect’s apprentice. One year later, he returned to Reno and established an architectural firm with a colleague from the Surveyor’s Office, and together they won commissions for approximately 30 buildings between 1907 and 1909. He began his solo career in 1909 when he won the design competition for the\nWashoe County Courthouse\n. Throughout his career he favored stone, brick and terra cotta as building materials, enlivening facades by using contrasting stone colors in a variety of patterns.\nDeLongchamps holds the distinction of being the only person to serve as Nevada’s State Architect. He was appointed to the position on April 10, 1919, and served for two years until the post was temporarily abolished, then reappointed in 1923 and served until the position was permanently abolished in 1926. While holding this office, DeLongchamps began the development of the governmental complex in Carson City across the street from the\nNevada State Capitol\n. The three buildings dramatically illustrate the evolution of the architect’s public architecture between the 1920s and 1930s. The twin Heroes Memorial Building (1921) and Ormsby County Courthouse (1920-1922) were designed while DeLongchamps was serving as State Architect, and are monumental, Neo-Classical buildings. Both buildings have large pediment porticos supported by four Doric columns. The Heroes Memorial Building was designed as “a fitting memorial to Nevada Soldiers who gave their lives in the service of the United States in the European War” (World War I).\nA decade later, when the Supreme Court had outgrown its single-room quarters in the Capitol, DeLongchamps was awarded the commission for a new building, which he designed in a compatible but distinctly Modern style. Today the Heroes Memorial Building and Supreme Courthouse the Nevada Attorney General’s Office. The Ormsby County Courthouse housed the Carson City (formerly Ormsby County) courts until 1999 when it was acquired by the State, and it is currently being remodeled for use by the Nevada State Attorney General’s office as well. Although not listed in the National Register of Historic Places, of interest is the granite fountain in front of the Supreme Court, presented to Carson City in 1909 by the National Humane Alliance to provide fresh water for passing horses and pets. Water pours out of small bronze lions heads with open mouths into a large drinking bowl for horses, mounted four feet off the ground, and small cups are located at the base for dogs and cats.\nInfo from www.nps.gov/nr/travel/nevada/pub.htm.\nStop 44: Former Nevada Supreme Court & State Library (1936) at 198 N.

Carson St.\nThe Kitzmeyer Furniture Factory is the oldest surviving Italianate-style, commercial building in Carson City.  It was found to be the most intact example of Italianate-style architecture associated with the commercial development of the late 19th century Carson City.\nThe Daily Appeal went on to report that the owners of the kiln had turned about 600,000 bricks in 1873.\nThe building housed a first-story furniture and housewares showroom and a second-story furniture factory.  Kitzmeyer had originally intended to build a three-story building, but ended up building only a two-story structure.\nIt was common for furniture makers to also make coffins as a line of “furniture,” the Kitzmeyers began an undertaking business in building and eventually expanding to Virginia City and Gardnerville.\nStop 47: Paul Laxalt Building (1891) at 401 N. Carson St.\nPressed red brick with extensive detail, wide arched windows, bays and an arcaded entrance decorated with carved sandstone, all add to the picturesque composition of the building.  The Victorian-style building was designed by Mifflin E. Bell, a prominent 19\nth\n-century federal government architect who also was responsible for post offices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Brooklyn, New York.  As with many of his other structures, Bell included an unusual three-faced clock in a 106-foot tower on the Carson City building’s northwest corner.\nThe Clock, which was made by Joseph Barborka Company of Iowa, runs on a lengthy weight system that extends four stories and must be wound by hand every ten days.\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, the building had Carson City’s first elevator, a three-story model that was installed in 1935.\nThe Nevada Commission on Tourism building was built in 1877 for the Carson City Opera House until it was purchased for the purpose of building the U.S. Courthouse and Post Office.\nSeptember 29, 1888 is when the cornerstone was laid.  Embedded inside the cornerstone is a silk handkerchief wrapped around a document from the first Masonic meeting describing the devastating 1875 fire that virtually destroyed Virginia City.  Officiating at the ceremony was Judge Thomas P. Hawley, the first presiding U.S. District Judge.\nOn May 19, 1891 the structure was completed at the cost of $134,605.53.  The building was occupied by the Post Office, Land Office, U.S. Courts, and the Weather Bureau.  In all, sixteen rooms were assigned to various agencies.  The building was topped by a 106-foot tall clock tower.  The four-story, redbrick landmark was Nevada’s first federal building.\nStop 48:\nForeman-Roberts House Museum (1863) 1207 N. Carson St.\nThe Gothic Revival Style Foreman-Roberts House was built in Old Washoe City, Utah Territory in 1863 by Solomon W. Foreman.\nIn 1867, it was sold to James D. Roberts and in 1874 was moved to 1207 N. Carson Street in Carson City.\nJames D. Roberts fought in the 1860 Pyramid Lake Indian War. This house was featured as the annual Carson City Christmas ornament in 2017.\nSuggestions\nNevada’s Historic Capital\nAttractions\nFood and Drink\nThings to Do\nPlaces to Stay\nEvents\nWe use cookies to help us improve, promote, and protect our services.

    "evidence": "Irrelohe is an opera in three acts by the Austrian composer Franz Schreker, libretto by the composer. Composition history Schreker wrote the libretto in a very short time (just a few days) in 1919. The work takes its name from a train station called Irrenlohe which Schreker passed through during a journey to Nuremberg in March 1919. Composition occupied Schreker from 1920 until 1922. The score was published in 1923 by Universal Edition Vienna. Performance history The opera was first performed on 27 March 1924 at the Stadttheater Köln, conducted by Otto Klemperer. Productions in a further seven cities followed (including Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Leipzig), but critical response was mixed and, together with changing audience tastes and the complexity of the score, the work failed to maintain its place in the repertoire. The first production in modern times was at the Bielefeld Opera in 1985, followed by a concert performance in Vienna in 1989. Further stagings have taken place at the Vienna Volksoper (2004), the Bonn Opera (2010), the Pfalztheater Kaiserslautern (2015) and Opéra de Lyon (2022). Franz Schreker (originally Schrecker; 23 March 1878 – 21 March 1934) was an Austrian composer, conductor, librettist, teacher and administrator. Primarily a composer of operas, Schreker developed a style characterized by aesthetic plurality (a mixture of Romanticism, Naturalism, Symbolism, Impressionism, Expressionism and Neue Sachlichkeit), timbral experimentation, strategies of extended tonality and conception of total music theatre into the narrative of 20th-century music. Formative years He was born as Franz Schrecker in Monaco, the eldest son of the Bohemian Jewish court photographer Ignaz Franz Schrekker (Germanized from Ignácz Furencz, originally Isak), and his wife, Eleonore von Cloßmann, who was a member of the Catholic aristocracy of Styria. He grew up during travels across half of Europe and, after the early death of his father, the family moved from Linz to Vienna (1888) where in 1892, with the help of a scholarship, Schreker entered the Vienna Conservatory. Starting with violin studies, with Sigismund Bachrich and Arnold Rosé, he moved into the composition class of Robert Fuchs, graduating as a composer in 1900. His first success was with the Intermezzo for strings, Op. 8, which won an important prize sponsored by the Neue musikalische Presse in 1901. His first opera, Flammen, was completed in 1902 but failed to receive a staged production. Career launch Schreker had begun conducting in 1895, when he had founded the Verein der Musikfreunde Döbling. In 1907 he formed the Vienna Philharmonic Chorus, which he conducted until 1920: among its many premières were Zemlinsky's Psalm XXIII and Schoenberg's Friede auf Erden and Gurre-Lieder. Schreker and other composers, such as Schoenberg and Zemlinsky, were influential during the Jugendstil movement, which incorporated non-western styles inspired by Ancient Egypt and the Far East. His 'pantomime', Der Geburtstag der Infantin, commissioned by the dancer Grete Wiesenthal and her sister Elsa for the opening of the 1908 Kunstschau, first called attention to his development as a composer. Such was the success of the venture that Schreker composed several more dance-related works for the two sisters including Der Wind, Valse lente and Ein Tanzspiel (Rokoko). Tim Fain is an American violinist and composer, best known for his performances in the feature film soundtracks to Black Swan, 12 Years a Slave, and Moonlight, and his work with American composer Philip Glass. Early life and education A native of Santa Monica, California, Fain is the son of Gordon and Margery Fain. He began studying violin at age of seven with his father, a neurophysiologist at University of California, Los Angeles, and at age of 10, he performed Beethoven’s Spring Sonata for his fifth-grade classmates. While living with his family in Cambridge, UK during middle school, Fain studied under Haroutune Bedelian at the Royal Conservatory of Music in London. After returning to the US for high school, Fain attended Crossroads School for the Arts and Sciences in Santa Monica, continuing violin studies at the Colburn School with Laura Schmieder and privately with Professor Eduard Schmieder. He received formal higher education in music at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and The Juilliard School where he studied and collaborated under prominent musicians and pedagogues such as Victor Danchenko, Felix Galimir, Richard Goode and Robert Mann. As a young instrumentalist, Fain launched his career with Young Concert Artists and was awarded the Avery Fisher Career Grant.",
