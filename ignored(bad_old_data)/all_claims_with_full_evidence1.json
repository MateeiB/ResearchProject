In this tutorial, you can use MLflow to visualize prompts and optimization progress as traces to understand the DSPy's behavior better. You can set up MLflow easily by following the four steps below.\nInstall MLflow\n%pip\ninstall\nmlflow>\n=\n2\n.20\nStart MLflow UI in a separate terminal\nmlflow\nui\n--port\n5000\nConnect the notebook to MLflow\nimport\nmlflow\nmlflow\n.\nset_tracking_uri\n(\n\"http://localhost:5000\"\n)\nmlflow\n.\nset_experiment\n(\n\"DSPy\"\n)\nEnabling tracing.\nmlflow\n.\ndspy\n.\nautolog\n()\nOnce you have completed the steps above, you can see traces for each program execution on the notebook. They provide great visibility into the model's behavior and helps you understand the DSPy's concepts better throughout the tutorial.\nTo kearn more about the integration, visit\nMLflow DSPy Documentation\nas well.\nIn this tutorial, we'll use an extremely small LM, Meta's\nLlama-3.2-3B-Instruct\nwhich has 3 billion parameters.\nA model like this is not very reliable out of the box for long or complex agent loops. However, it's extremely fast and cheap to host, as it needs very little RAM.\nYou might be able to host the 3B model on your laptop with Ollama, on your GPU server with SGLang, or via a provider that hosts it for you like Databricks or Together.\nIn the snippet below, we'll configure our main LM as\nLlama-3.2-3B\n. We'll also set up a larger LM, i.e.\nGPT-4o\n, as a teacher that we'll invoke a very small number of times to help teach the small LM.\nIn\u00a0[1]:\nCopied!\nimport\ndspy\nllama3b\n=\ndspy\n.\nLM\n(\n'<provider>/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct'\n,\ntemperature\n=\n0.7\n)\ngpt4o\n=\ndspy\n.\nLM\n(\n'openai/gpt-4o'\n,\ntemperature\n=\n0.7\n)\ndspy\n.\nconfigure\n(\nlm\n=\nllama3b\n)\nimport dspy\nllama3b = dspy.LM('\n/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct', temperature=0.7)\ngpt4o = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o', temperature=0.7)\ndspy.configure(lm=llama3b)\nLet's load a dataset for our task.

(Todd Rundgren album) | Up Against It! is a 1997 album by Todd Rundgren, essentially consisting of Rundgren's song demos for the Off Broadway show that were Written and Recorded by Todd from 1986-88.

It is her seventh and last novel set in the Familias Regnant fictional universe. It does not fall in either informal trilogy (the Heris Serrano and the Esmay Suiza trilogies); fittingly it does not focus on any particular character, instead a more general, almost kaleidoscopic perspective of the upheaval in the Familias Regnant, and the rise to power of a new and more capable Speaker. It can be seen as a conclusion to the series, resolving or at least making a good start at resolving many issues and peoples and ending as it does on a memorializing elegiac note.\u00bb\n[6] \u00abOther retrieved pages have titles: `Against All Things Ending`, `Mark Greif`, `The Man Who Wouldn't Stand Up`, `Against the Day`, `Against a Dark Background`, `Against the Day (1999)`, `Against Happiness`, `Seventeen Against the Dealer`, `Against Our Will`, `Fredy Perlman`, `The Case Against Barack Obama`, `Against the Fall of Night`, `Against Therapy`, `The War Against the Assholes`, `Thirteen Against Fate`, `Hollywood, Interrupted`, `The Opposing Shore`, `Tim Weiner`, `Against Democracy`, `Against Equality of Opportunity`, `H.

His public career was short but prolific, lasting from 1964 until his death three years later. During this brief period he shocked, outraged, and amused audiences with his scandalous black comedies. The adjective \"Ortonesque\" is sometimes used to refer to work characterised by a similarly dark yet farcical cynicism.\n[[ ## thought_3 ## ]]\nI have identified both playwrights as Bernard-Marie Kolt\u00e8s and Joe Orton, who both wrote the unproduced script for \"Up Against It\".\n[[ ## tool_name_3 ## ]]\nfinish\n[[ ## tool_args_3 ## ]]\n{}\n[[ ## observation_3 ## ]]\nCompleted.\nRespond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## titles ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python list[str]), and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.\nResponse:\n[[ ## reasoning ## ]]\nThe claim states that the authors of the unproduced script for \"Up Against It\" are both playwrights. Investigation revealed that Bernard-Marie Kolt\u00e8s wrote the unproduced script, and further research confirmed that Joe Orton was also a playwright who wrote the script. Therefore, both playwrights are indeed the authors of the unproduced script for \"Up Against It\".\n[[ ## titles ## ]]\n[\"Bernard-Marie Kolt\u00e8s\", \"Joe Orton\"]\n[[ ## completed ## ]]\nFinally, let's save our optimized program so we can use it again later.\nIn\u00a0[18]:\nCopied!\noptimized_react\n.\nsave\n(\n\"optimized_react.json\"\n)\nloaded_react\n=\ndspy\n.\nReAct\n(\n\"claim -> titles: list[str]\"\n,\ntools\n=\n[\nsearch_wikipedia\n,\nlookup_wikipedia\n],\nmax_iters\n=\n20\n)\nloaded_react\n.\nload\n(\n\"optimized_react.json\"\n)\nloaded_react\n(\nclaim\n=\n\"The author of the 1960s unproduced script written for The Beatles, Up Against It, and Bernard-Marie Kolt\u00e8s are both playwrights.\"\n)\n.\ntitles\noptimized_react.save(\"optimized_react.json\")\nloaded_react = dspy.ReAct(\"claim -> titles: list[str]\", tools=[search_wikipedia, lookup_wikipedia], max_iters=20)\nloaded_react.load(\"optimized_react.json\")\nloaded_react(claim=\"The author of the 1960s unproduced script written for The Beatles, Up Against It, and Bernard-Marie Kolt\u00e8s are both playwrights.\").titles\nOut[18]:\n['Bernard-Marie Kolt\u00e8s', 'Joe Orton']\nSaving programs in MLflow Experiment\nInstead of saving the program to a local file, you can track it in MLflow for better reproducibility and collaboration.\nDependency Management\n: MLflow automatically save the frozen environment metadata along with the program to ensure reproducibility.\nExperiment Tracking\n: With MLflow, you can track the program's performance and cost along with the program itself.\nCollaboration\n: You can share the program and results with your team members by sharing the MLflow experiment.\nTo save the program in MLflow, run the following code:\nimport\nmlflow\n# Start an MLflow Run and save the program\nwith\nmlflow\n.\nstart_run\n(\nrun_name\n=\n\"optimized_rag\"\n):\nmodel_info\n=\nmlflow\n.\ndspy\n.\nlog_model\n(\noptimized_react\n,\nartifact_path\n=\n\"model\"\n,\n# Any name to save the program in MLflow\n)\n# Load the program back from MLflow\nloaded\n=\nmlflow\n.\ndspy\n.\nload_model\n(\nmodel_info\n.\nmodel_uri\n)\nTo learn more about the integration, visit\nMLflow DSPy Documentation\nas well.\nBack to top",
