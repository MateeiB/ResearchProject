This first part covers his first eight bouts in 1985, showcasing his aggressive style and rapid rise to fame.\n\n   Key Points:\n\n   1. Mike Tyson made his professional debut against Hector Mercedes on March 6, 1985, winning via knockout in the second round.\n\n   2. Tyson faced four opponents under 200 lbs in his first eight fights, including Spain (whom he defeated in just 39 seconds) and John Alderson (who was knocked down twice in their July 11th matchup).\n\n   3. The \"Missing Fight\" against Larry Sims on July 19th, 1985, is shrouded in conspiracies, with theories ranging from camera crews being late to the event to footage destruction by Tyson's trainers and promoters.\n\n   Final Analysis: Despite analyzing six of Tyson's fights, we are still only halfway through his bouts for 1985 due to his hyperactive schedule.

The composition is described as a challenge and a quest in time and space, requiring human involvement for its ongoing survival.\n\nThe article also mentions performances of Longplayer, such as one scheduled at the Roundhouse in London during the weekend it was published.
