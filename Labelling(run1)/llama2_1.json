    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "generated_label": "False",
    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, the claim that \"The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office concluded ObamaCare will cost the U.S. more than 800,000 jobs\" is False. The CBO did not conclude that Obamacare would result in a loss of 800,000 jobs. In fact, the CBO's report stated that the law would reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by a small amount, primarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply. The CBO did not use the 800,000 jobs number in its report, and the number was an extrapolation calculated by critics of the law. The CBO director confirmed the number but also noted that it was an extrapolation and might not be precise.\n\nTherefore, the claim is False as it exaggerates the CBO's conclusions and includes no qualifiers."
