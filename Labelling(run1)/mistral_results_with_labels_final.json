In addition, a minimum of $1 per enrollee, per month must be allocated by insurers offering plans that include abortion coverage into an account used for abortion services. However, there is no indication in the article that the administration has mandated all persons enrolled in these plans to pay a separate premium for abortions from their own pockets. Furthermore, the article explains that not all states will allow abortion coverage in plans sold on their exchanges and that non-abortion options will always be available. Therefore, it seems that the claim of \"$1 abortions\" is accurate only in terms of the minimum amount that must be allocated for abortion services, but does not reflect the actual cost of an abortion, which can be much higher. The second claim about requiring \"all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion\" is misleading as it suggests that all such persons are required to pay for abortions, but only those who purchase a plan with abortion coverage will be paying for it personally and not through federal dollars.\n\n2.

The Florida Hospital Association conducted a study predicting that expanding Medicaid in Florida would create about 120,000 jobs.

Greg Abbott's claim about road congestion costs in Austin, Dallas, and Houston is based on research conducted by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, which has been compiling such data since 1984. The institute calculates the cost of traffic congestion using four sets of numbers, including travel delay during peak commuting times and excess fuel consumption from being stuck in traffic. In Houston, the average yearly delay per commuter was found to be 61 hours, with an excess fuel consumption of 29 gallons at $3.12 (average price for a gallon of gasoline in Texas in 2014), totaling to a congestion cost of $1,490 per commuter according to the scorecard. However, when we multiplied the yearly delay (61 hours) by the peak congestion cost per hour ($17.67), and added that to the excess fuel consumption rate (29 gallons at $3.12 per gallon), our calculations yielded a lower annual average cost of $1,168. The discrepancy arises because the total congestion cost Abbott and others cite includes both peak travel and off-peak travel times, while the tables in the scorecard only show figures for peak travel times.\n\n   2.

While our calculations gave a lower figure than the one provided by the governor ($1,168 compared to $1,490), it is still within the range of the original claim, as the cost in Houston was stated as almost $1,500 a year.

    "justification": "1. Justification: In December 2013, Daniel Harrop claimed that the city's pension fund needed to be funded at $1.2 billion. The article states that he based this claim on two blog postings from reporter Ted Nesi of WPRI.com, one published on October 30, which reported the fund had $283 million in assets on Oct. 22, and the other, published on Dec. 7, said the fund had a liability of \"almost $1.2 billion.\" Additionally, Harrop also cited a 2011 city report stating the liability as of June 30, 2010, was $1.256 billion, with assets of $316 million. As the article mentions, now that we have the up-to-date financial reports (January 2014), it shows that on June 30, 2013, the city needed $1.2 billion to cover its current and future pension obligations, which aligns with Harrop's statement. However, the city's pension fund had $336 million in investments and other assets at that time.\n\n  2. Label: True. Although Harrop did not provide an exact date for his statement, he based it on up-to-date information available to him at the time, which shows that the city's pension fund needed to be funded at $1.2 billion, as stated in his claim.",

However, as the article points out, Reid has not provided any solid evidence to back up this claim.

In contrast, Taymore \"Tay-K 47\" McIntyre, a young Texas rapper, faces potential capital charges and could receive a life sentence with parole eligibility after 40 years. The article provides evidence that the Supreme Court ruling in Roper vs. Simmons states that the death penalty cannot be imposed on juvenile offenders under 18, which is why Pagourtzis cannot face the death penalty.\n\n2.

It cites a 2013 report commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The report breaks down these jobs into three categories: direct jobs, indirect jobs, and induced jobs. Direct jobs are those involved in the oil and gas industry itself, such as extraction and production. Indirect jobs are positions in activities outside industries that supply the oil and gas fields, and induced jobs are created to meet the demand from the spending of employees in the direct and indirect jobs.
