    "justification": "The claim that \"The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office concluded ObamaCare will cost the U.S. more than 800,000 jobs\" is Conflicting because the evidence provided by the PolitiFact article contradicts this claim. The CBO report does not conclude that Obamacare will cost the US more than 800,000 jobs. Instead, the report projects that the law will reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by a small amount, primarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply.\n\nThe article quotes the CBO director, Douglas Elmendorf, who testified to the House Budget Committee that the number of 800,000 jobs was an extrapolation and might not be precise. He also noted that the law could actually help economic productivity. The PolitiFact analysis rated Bachmann's claim Mostly False because it exaggerated the CBO's conclusions in a misleading fashion and included no qualifiers.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim is incorrect and the label Conflicting is appropriate."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, the label \"True\" is an appropriate description of the claim that more than 50 percent of immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras use at least one major welfare program once they arrive in the US. The article cites data from the Center for Immigration Studies, which relied on Census Bureau data to make this assertion.\n\nThe evidence presented in the article supports the claim that a significant portion of immigrants from these countries use welfare programs. According to the data, 57 percent of households headed by immigrants from El Salvador, 54 percent of Honduran households, and 49 percent of Guatemalan immigrant households use at least one major welfare program, compared to 24 percent of native households. These numbers suggest that a higher percentage of immigrants from these countries use welfare programs than native households.\n\nIt is worth noting that the article also highlights some limitations and caveats related to the data. For example, it notes that including children in the household's total income can lead to an inflated estimate of welfare use, and that some programs, such as Medicaid, may have a higher usage rate among immigrants than native households. However, these limitations do not alter the overall conclusion that a significant portion of immigrants from these countries use welfare programs.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is reasonable to label the claim that more than 50 percent of immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras use at least one major welfare program once they arrive in the US as true."

    "justification": "The claim that the Seven Years War led to near bankruptcy for many countries and fueled the American desire for independence is supported by the evidence provided. The article highlights how the war was expensive for all parties involved, with Great Britain spending a significant amount of money to cover the cost of the conflict. This led to the implementation of taxes and policies in the Americas, including the Stamp Act, Townshend Tariffs, and Tea Act, which were met with resistance from colonists who believed they should only be taxed with their consent and being taxed without representation was tyranny.\n\nThe article also notes that the Seven Years War was a long and expensive affair for all parties involved, with Great Britain controlling the 13 colonies from the coast to the Appalachian Mountains and France controlling the surrounding land west of the Appalachians from Louisiana stretching up to Canada. This highlights how the war had a significant impact on the global economy and led to a significant increase in taxes for Great Britain, which then tried to get these taxes from the colonies.\n\nFurthermore, the article quotes Kathleen DuVal, a professor of history at UNC Chapel Hill, who states that the fact that colonists weren't represented in Parliament was central to their cause and that the Revolution was not about a desire to cut taxes but rather a problem with being taxed without representation. This further supports the claim that the Seven Years War led to near bankruptcy for many countries and fueled the American desire for independence.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it can be justified that the label \"True\" accurately represents the claim that the Seven Years War led to near bankruptcy for many countries and fueled the American desire for independence."

    "justification": "The claim that \"there were 40,000 new laws put on the books in one day\" on January 1 of this year is incorrect. The evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim.\n\nFirstly, the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) reported that U.S. states and territories passed more than 40,000 bills and resolutions into law in 2011, but did not specify how many of these laws went into effect on January 1. Even if we assume that all of these laws went into effect on the same day, the total number would still be significantly less than 40,000.\n\nSecondly, the article cites a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation who estimated that typically, the number of federal regulations put in place in a single year ranges from 3,000 to 4,000. This suggests that even if all of these regulations went into effect on January 1, the total number would be significantly less than 40,000.\n\nThirdly, the article mentions that the Congressional Record of Jan. 3, 2012 listed about 80 bills that had become law in the previous 12 months, but did not provide any information on how many of these laws went into effect on January 1.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim of 40,000 new laws going into effect on January 1 of this year is incorrect.

This means that the photo cannot be of one of the prisoners.\n\nSecondly, news outlets such as de Volkskrant and other blogs have identified the man in the photo as Khalid K., a Dutch-Iraqi ISIS terrorist. These accounts provide independent confirmation that the image is not of the Taliban prisoners released by President Obama.\n\nThirdly, while there are claims that the image has been revived and mistakenly identified as Mohammad Fazl, one of the five Taliban prisoners swapped in exchange for Bergdahl, these claims are unfounded and based on false information.

However, upon closer inspection, the actual decline is only 43%, which is significantly less than the claim made by Gayle Smith. Additionally, the article notes that current trends could be negative, rather than positive, and highlights that there has been largely no progress since 2007.\n\nFurthermore, the article points out that regional variation is significant, with some regions making much faster progress than others. For example, Southern Asia, which includes India, drove down the number of out-of-school children by nearly 70 percent, while Northern Africa saw a decrease of nearly 90 percent. On the other hand, Latin America and the Caribbean have seen a growth in the number of out-of-school children since 2010.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that Gayle Smith's claim of \"half as many children out of school today as there were 15 years ago\" is overstated and may not accurately reflect the current situation.

According to budget documents, local taxes account for only 11 percent of the Newark Public Schools' overall budget in the 2011-2012 fiscal year. State aid, grants, and entitlements make up the largest portion of the district's revenues, at nearly 80 percent. Federal aid and various other funding sources make up the rest of the budget.\nSenator Ronald Rice acknowledged that the state finances the bulk of the district's budget, but he meant to reference the dollar amount - \"about $80 million\" or more - not the percentage, of the budget funded by local taxpayers. Of the district's $970 million spending plan for the 2011-2012 fiscal year, local taxes account for more than $106 million. The state is funding more than $775 million through aid and grants.\nWhile Senator Rice argues that if the Urban Hope Act passed, it would effectively impose \"taxation without representation,\" because they have no voice to say \"yea or nay\" on the project, the evidence provided does not support the claim that Newark taxpayers foot 80 percent of the bill for the school district.

    "justification": "The claim that the Obama administration \"went to court to keep one of these five in jail at Guantanamo just three years ago because he was such a huge risk\" is Conflicting. The evidence provided in the article does not support this claim.\n\nFirstly, the article states that the United States argued for continued detention of Khairullah Khairkhwa, one of the five men released to Qatar in the Bergdahl deal, in a court case in 2011. However, the administration did not go to court to keep him in jail because they considered him a huge risk. Instead, the United States argued that Khairkhwa was a member of the Taliban or al-Qaida or associated forces at the time of his capture, which is supported by evidence from the Taliban's highest governing body and Khairkhwa's known association with Osama bin Laden.\n\nSecondly, the article quotes a law professor, Mark Denbeaux, who states that the decision does not say that it's the U.S. trying to keep them here, but rather defending the standard that someone is a lawful enemy combatant. This suggests that the administration's goal in detaining Khairkhwa was not to keep him in jail because of the perceived risk he posed, but rather to defend their right to detain him as a member of a terrorist organization.\n\nFinally, the article mentions that there were varying opinions within the administration on whether Khairkhwa was a risk, with some considering him \"high risk\" and others considering him more of a civilian than a military figure. This suggests that the administration did not have a unified view on the risk posed by Khairkhwa, which undermines the claim that they went to court to keep him in jail because of his perceived risk.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim that the Obama administration went to court to keep one of these five in jail at Guantanamo just three years ago because he was such a huge risk is Conflicting. The administration's goals in detaining Khairkhwa were not driven by a desire to keep him in jail because of the perceived risk he posed, but rather to defend their right to detain him as a member of a terrorist organization."

    "justification": "The claim that \"71 percent of doctors say Hillary's health concerns are 'serious' and 'could be disqualifying'\" is false. The supporting article text provides several reasons why this label is appropriate:\n\n1. The survey was conducted by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), a small conservative/libertarian medical group with a largely conservative or libertarian membership. As the article notes, the AAPS has publicized discredited ideas such as vaccines causing autism and abortion increasing the risk of breast cancer. This raises questions about the objectivity and credibility of the survey results.\n2. The survey was poorly designed, as noted in the article. For example, respondents were given no choice but to agree with the statement that the concerns \"should be addressed as with full release of medical records,\" which could have influenced their answers. Additionally, the survey did not ask about each respondent's medical specialty, lumping together the evaluations of neurologists and gynecologists without context.\n3. The article highlights that the poll was based on a two-day online survey begun by the AAPS on Sept. 5, with only 3,700 known physicians on its email list receiving the invitation to participate. This is a small sample size compared to the American Medical Association's reported 224,503 members in 2012.\n4. The AAPS news release does not mention that the survey was limited to its members, further adding to the questionable validity of the results.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the claim of a significant consensus among doctors about Hillary Clinton's health is overstated and unreliable. The evidence provided undermines the credibility of the survey and suggests that any conclusion based on it would be misleading. Therefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate."

Additionally, O'Rourke frequently touts crime figures from El Paso to say that the city is among the safest in the country, with the FBI data showing that El Paso's violent crime rate has been significantly lower than the average for all localities of a similar size every year from 1985 until 2017.\n\nBased on these figures, it can be concluded that O'Rourke's statement about El Paso having five murders the entire year in some years and averaging 18 (murders per year) over the last 10 years is accurate.

Vice President Joe Biden made this statement during an event at Plymouth State University, citing the low cost of the operation in comparison to other military operations. The evidence provided in the article supports this claim, as the Defense Department estimates that total spending for the Libya intervention reached $1.1 billion through September 30, 2011, and there were no reported fatalities among American soldiers during the seven-month campaign led by NATO.\n\nWhile some peripheral costs associated with military efforts may be difficult to track, such as diplomatic and intelligence operations, the article notes that these costs pale in comparison to the operational costs of war, which are typically very high. Therefore, while there may be additional costs outside of the Defense Department budget, they are likely to be small relative to the military costs of the operation, as suggested by Todd Harrison, a senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is reasonable to conclude that America did not lose any lives during the Libya intervention, and that the cost of the operation was relatively low compared to other military operations.

    "justification": "The claim that Donald Trump's foundation \"took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself\" is true based on the evidence provided in the article. The Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold found through a review of 17 years of tax filings by the Donald J. Trump Foundation and interviews with over 200 individuals and groups who were listed as recipients of its gifts, that nearly all of the money in recent years has come from people other than Trump, with his most recent personal gift to the foundation's coffers dating from 2008. Fahrenthold also found two cases where Trump used his money from the charity to buy himself a gift, including the six-foot-tall painting of himself that Obama referenced in his speech. The auction for the painting was held in 2006 but the check wasn't cut until 2007, a year in which almost all of the money in the Trump Foundation was other people's money. Specifically, according to Fahrenthold's reporting, Trump himself gave $35,000 to the foundation that year, but other donors gave $4.055 million, primarily a single $4 million gift from Vince and Linda McMahon, the founders of the WWE wrestling empire. Using the most generous calculation, Trump's own money accounted for less than 1% of the total amount that entered the foundation that year, $4,094,238.

The article also mentions that the Republican plan championed by GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan also trims Medicare spending by almost exactly the same amount.\n\nThe article provides several pieces of evidence to support this claim, including:\n\n1.

The evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim.\n\nFirstly, the chart provided in the article shows that the number of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood has essentially held steady, with marginal increases and a modest peak in 2009. This contradicts the claim that in 2013, there were more abortions than in 2006.\n\nSecondly, the article states that medical experts pointed to changing guidelines for Pap smears, the screening test for cervical cancer, as the reason for the decline in cancer screenings and preventive services provided by Planned Parenthood. This suggests that the decrease in non-abortion services is not due to an increase in abortions, but rather a change in medical guidelines.\n\nThirdly, the article provides data on the number of services provided by Planned Parenthood from 2006 to 2013, which shows that while abortions have remained steady, other services such as STI/STD testing and treatment have increased by 50 percent since 2006.

    "justification": "The claim that President Donald Trump's abortion rule \"puts at risk 15 times more funding and millions more women and families... than previous similar policies by Republican presidents\" is true based on the evidence provided. The comparison of family planning and global health programs shows that while previous Republican administrations exempted certain programs from the Mexico City policy, Trump's order does not provide any exceptions, potentially affecting a much larger amount of funding.\n\nAccording to the article, under President Reagan and the Bush administrations, the Mexico City policy only applied to family planning funding. However, President Trump's order expanded the reach of the policy to \"all assistance for voluntary population planning,\" which includes global health programs (Kaiser Family Foundation). This means that compared to previous Republican presidents, Trump's policy puts more funding at risk.\n\nThe article also provides data on the amount of funding affected by each administration's version of the Mexico City policy. While family planning assistance represents around $600 million per year, global health funding overall is close to $10 billion (Kaiser Family Foundation). This means that Trump's policy puts 15 times more funding at risk than previous similar policies by Republican presidents.\n\nFurthermore, the article notes that under Trump's order, the pipeline of family planning and global health programs is more complicated than expected, with governments agencies often contracting with nonprofits which in turn subcontract to smaller organizations in countries around the world (Kaiser Family Foundation). This complexity makes it difficult to know the real impact of the order, but it is clear that Trump's policy puts a lot more funding on the line than previous Republican presidents did.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, the claim that President Donald Trump's abortion rule \"puts at risk 15 times more funding and millions more women and families... than previous similar policies by Republican presidents\" is true."

While the Esshaki campaign cites a report funded by a group lobbying against Medicare for All to make this assertion, the evidence provided is flawed and misleading.\n\nFirstly, the report's assumptions about physician salaries and supply are not necessarily causal, as noted by University of Michigan economist Joelle Abramowitz. The report assumes that Medicare payment rates would remain constant under Medicare for All, which is unlikely to be the case. Therefore, the conclusion that a decline in incomes would lead to a corresponding decline in the supply of physicians is not supported by the evidence.\n\nSecondly, the reports shared by Esshaki's campaign do not specify how many doctors and nurses are included in the figure of 420,000 health care employees who would lose their jobs under a public option. This lack of specificity undermines the claim that this number is directly attributable to Medicare for All or a public option.\n\nThirdly, experts predict that most of the job losses under Medicare for All would be in the health insurance industry, such as insurance brokers, medical billing workers, and other administrative roles. This suggests that the claim of 100,000 doctor and nurse eliminations is overstated.\n\nFinally, Stevens herself has clarified her stance on Medicare for All, stating that she does not support it but instead favors a public option. This contradicts Esshaki's claim that her plan would lead to massive job losses in the medical profession.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be some job losses under Medicare for All or a public option, the evidence provided by Esshaki's campaign is flawed and misleading.

Valdes also mentions that her organization manages El Paso clinics' participation in the state's Breast and Cervical Cancer Services program, which provides low-cost or free screenings to women in need.

These clinics are located throughout the county and do not offer abortions, which further contradicts the claim that someone living in El Paso would need to drive 550 miles each way to San Antonio for something as simple as cervical cancer screening.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim that someone living in El Paso would have to drive 550 miles each way to San Antonio for cervical cancer screening is false. Women in El Paso do have access to cervical cancer screenings within their own city and in nearby Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, which makes the claim unnecessary and exaggerated."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim provided because the evidence does not support the claim. While the claim states that the Obama administration is proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030, the evidence provided by Greenpeace and PolitiFact contradicts this claim.\n\nFirstly, there is no proposal to mine 10 billion tons of coal. The estimate of 10.2 billion tons of coal proposed for mining is found in a 3,000-page report and is not a real proposal or prediction. As stated by the Bureau spokeswoman Kristen Lenhardt, \"It was not a plan for how much coal may, or may not be, leased in future years.\"\n\nSecondly, even if this were a real proposal, the timeline assumed by Credo is unrealistic. The country has consumed around 1 billion tons of coal annually in recent years, and replacing all the coal that is currently burned with new coal from Wyoming would not use that much coal, as stated by Michael Mann, executive director of the Institute for Energy Studies at the University of North Dakota.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, the claim is incorrect, and the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate to describe it."

    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim \"Says the federal government hosted a conference and 'ordered 250 muffins at 16 bucks a piece.'\" is compatible with the evidence provided. The evidence states that the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General found that during a conference in August 2007, the government was billed $4,200 for 250 muffins at a cost of $16 each. This is the basis for Bill O'Reilly's claim that the federal government spent excessively on muffins at a conference.\n\nThe label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because while the evidence does indicate that the government was billed a significant amount for muffins, it does not provide enough information to determine if the cost of $16 per muffin is accurate or reasonable. The report notes that the hotel's headquarters issued a statement indicating that invoices sometimes do not fully reflect the services provided, which could suggest that the cost of the muffins may be higher than initially stated. Additionally, the inspector general's office responded to Hilton's statement with its own statement, indicating that even if the $4,200 fee included additional food and beverage items, the OIG believes that many individual food and beverage items listed on conference invoices and paid by the Department were very costly.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the evidence provided, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because while there is evidence to support the claim that the government was billed a significant amount for muffins at a conference, there is not enough information to determine if the cost of $16 per muffin is accurate or reasonable."

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) donor lookup and a similar tool offered by the Center for Responsive Politics show seven donations made by Donald Trump to Clinton's presidential campaign, with a total amount of $17,000. However, the Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier stated that between Trump and his children, it is ten times the amount, indicating that the money donated by Trump's family members should be included in the count.

That\u2019s more than credit card debt\" as True. The evidence from various sources, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Reserve System, confirms that student debt has surpassed credit card debt in recent years.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's report, in the first three months of 2014, student loan debt totaled $1.1 trillion, while credit card debt hit $659 billion. This indicates that student debt is currently higher than credit card debt. Additionally, the evidence from the Urban Institute suggests that the increase in student debt during the Great Recession was due to more people going back to school because of the job situation, which further supports the claim.\n\nFurthermore, the statistic cited by Senator Mark Warner during his re-election stump speech, \"Right now, America has $1.1 trillion of student debt.

    "justification": "The claim \"Nearly 45 percent of the women who receive health screenings through (the Women\u2019s Health Program) do so at a Planned Parenthood health center\" is appropriate because it provides a specific and accurate figure regarding the proportion of women in the program who receive services from Planned Parenthood clinics. The evidence provided in the article supports this claim, as it cites data from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission showing that in fiscal year 2010, about 46 percent of clients in the state's Women's Health Program had received services from Planned Parenthood clinics.\n\nWhile the article does note that the figure may not accurately reflect the proportion of women in the program who solely depend on Planned Parenthood for their screenings, as some women may have received services from both Planned Parenthood and non-Planned Parenthood providers, this does not negate the validity of the overall claim. The article provides evidence that a significant portion of women in the program do receive services from Planned Parenthood clinics, which supports the claim that nearly 45 percent of women who receive health screenings through the program do so at a Planned Parenthood health center.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim \"Nearly 45 percent of the women who receive health screenings through (the Women\u2019s Health Program) do so at a Planned Parenthood health center.\""

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim \"Every dollar of foreign aid for agricultural research \"will bring $4 in trade with the countries and the United States ... generating employment back in the U.S.\"\" based on the following reasons:\n\n1. Lack of specificity: The evidence provided does not offer a clear definition of how the $4 in trade will be generated or how the employment in the US will be created. The study cited only talks about \"a sort of domino effect,\" without providing detailed mechanisms for how aid leads to increased trade and job creation.\n2. Outdated information: The study cited is 20 years old, which raises concerns about its relevance and accuracy. No other studies are mentioned that reach the same conclusion, suggesting that the claim may not be supported by more recent research.\n3. Limited scope: The study only looks at the impact of agricultural research on trade and employment in developing countries. It does not consider other factors that could affect the relationship between foreign aid and US jobs, such as changes in global market conditions or technological advancements.\n4. Caveats and qualifications: Several experts interviewed for the article express skepticism about Fan's claim, noting that the causal chain from aid to trade to job creation is complex and difficult to quantify. They also mention that the study cited has limitations in terms of its methodology and the assumptions it makes.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim may have been intended to highlight the potential benefits of foreign aid for agricultural research, the evidence provided does not provide a clear or convincing argument for a 4:1 return on investment in terms of trade and job creation in the US.

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "Based on the provided evidence, we can conclude that the claim made by NAACP President Cornell William Brooks about the number of hate crimes in the United States is accurate. The Hate Crime Statistics Act defines hate crimes as \"crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, gender and gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.\" There are two main programs for data collection on hate crimes in the United States: the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program and the National Crime Victimization Survey.\n\nThe FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program aggregates voluntary data from law enforcement agencies around the country, but it relies solely on crimes that are reported to the police. This program estimated 5,796 hate crime incidents in 2012, which is significantly lower than Brooks' claimed number of at least 200,000 to 300,000 hate crimes per year. However, the National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, asked nearly 160,000 people annually whether or not they have been victims of crime, including hate crimes. In 2012, the survey estimated that 293,800 hate crime victimizations occurred, which is in line with Brooks' statement.\n\nThere are several reasons why the FBI's data may underreport the number of hate crimes:\n\n1. Agency non-participation: Some states with high percentages of African-American victims have low participation rates in the UCR program.\n2. Lack of reporting: Local police officers may be incapable of properly identifying hate crimes when they are reported to them, leading to undercounting.\n3. Victim reluctance: Immigrants or other victims may be reluctant to report incidents to the police due to language barriers or cultural norms.\n4. Overcounting: The National Crime Victimization Survey may overcount the incidence of hate crimes as it simply asks victims whether or not they think they were targeted because of bias related to their membership in a protected category.\n\nBased on these factors, it is likely that the true number of hate crimes in the United States is closer to Brooks' claimed number than the FBI's estimated 5,796 incidents. Therefore, we label the claim as True."

    "justification": "The label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim that \"Israel cut its illegal immigration rate by 99% by constructing a 143-mile fence along its southern border.\" The evidence provided in the article supports this claim.\n\nFirstly, the article cites a specific number - 16,000 - for the number of people illegally crossing Israel's southern border in 2011, which decreased to less than 20 by 2016, a 99% decrease. This is a clear and concrete example of how the fence has reduced illegal immigration.\n\nSecondly, the article quotes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying that the fence has stopped all illegal immigration, which suggests that the fence has been successful in preventing illegal crossings.\n\nThirdly, the article mentions that President Trump has touted Israel's southern barrier and given a nod to Trump's own border wall initiative, indicating that he believes the Israeli fence is effective in reducing illegal immigration.\n\nFourthly, experts interviewed in the article acknowledge that the fence has been successful in reducing illegal immigration, but caution against generalizing that the fence is the sole reason for the drop in illegal crossings. They also highlight the importance of other factors such as the scale and heavily guarded nature of the border, which can affect the effectiveness of a wall or fence.\n\nBased on these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the construction of the 143-mile fence has indeed led to a significant reduction in illegal immigration into Israel. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim."

This implies that only a small portion of parks in Austin have recycling facilities, with the majority of them lacking it. Furthermore, the evidence notes that the city has launched recycling in every recreation and cultural center and in most of Austin\u2019s biggest parks, but this does not necessarily mean that all neighborhood parks have recycling facilities.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence provides information on the efforts being made by the city to expand recycling to all parks and facilities in three phases, with the goal of extending recycling to all parks. However, this process is ongoing, and as of the time of the article (April 2018), nearly every neighborhood park still lacks recycling.\n\nBased on these facts, it can be concluded that the statement \"Nearly every neighborhood park in Austin lacks recycling\" is accurate based on the evidence provided."

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The claim that President Obama \"stood up to China and protected American workers\" by imposing tariffs on Chinese tires is supported by the evidence provided in the article. Here are some key points that support the label of True:\n\n1. The United States and China became permanent, normal trading partners in 2001, after China joined the World Trade Organization. As a condition of joining, China agreed to a provision in law that lets the U.S. government determine whether a product from China is being imported in such increased quantities that it causes \"market disruption\" to domestic producers.\n2. In 2009, the United Steelworkers sought relief from a surge in Chinese tire imports that the union said had cost more than 5,000 U.S. jobs since 2004. A panel with the U.S. International Trade Commission heard the case and determined that \"certain passenger vehicle and light truck tires from the People\u2019s Republic of China are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers of like or directly competitive products.\"\n3. President Obama did impose a tariff, albeit a lighter one of 35 percent, 30 percent and 25 percent over three years, on Chinese tires after the U.S. International Trade Commission recommended a three-year tariff. China appealed the tariff to the WTO but lost. It expires this month.\n4. A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that the tariffs saved as many as 1,200 domestic jobs. The study\u2019s lead author, Gary Clyde Hufbauer, served as deputy assistant secretary for international trade and investment policy under President Jimmy Carter. He has written extensively about international trade.\n5. Romney criticized Obama's move, saying that such protections encourage lower productivity and will ultimately lead to the decline of domestic industries.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that President Obama took action to protect American tire manufacturing jobs from Chinese competition, which was seen as a threat to the market disruption. The tariffs imposed by Obama were seen as a way to help domestic producers compete with cheaper Chinese imports and save jobs in the industry. While some argue that the tariffs may have had unintended consequences such as higher prices for consumers and retaliatory measures from China, the evidence suggests that President Obama's actions were intended to protect American workers and industries from unfair competition. Therefore, the label True is appropriate."

The article cites several sources, including the U.S. Department of Defense report to Congress, which estimates that North Korea's total military personnel ranks as the fourth largest in the world. Specifically, the report states that North Korea has approximately 950,000 ground forces, 60,000 naval personnel, and 92,000 air force personnel, for a total of about 1.1 million personnel. These numbers are significantly higher than those of other countries per capita, with China having the largest active military in number of personnel, followed by the United States and India.\n\nFurthermore, the article notes that while North Korea's military hardware is largely legacy equipment based on designs from the Soviet Union and China dating back to the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, there are a few systems based on modern technology. This suggests that while North Korea's military may not be as technologically advanced as some other countries, it still maintains a significant number of personnel.\n\nAdditionally, the article cites a statement by Gen. James D. Thurman, commander of the United States-South Korea combined forces, before the House Armed Services Committee, which supports the idea that North Korea has a large military force. The Economist article also ranks North Korea fourth in overall personnel, with 1.2 million active-duty personnel, behind China, the United States, and India.\n\nBased on these sources, it can be concluded that North Korea has a substantial standing army, one of the largest per capita in the world. While its military hardware may be outdated or obsolete, its sheer number of personnel is significant and should not be underestimated. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim."

    "justification": "The label \"False\" is appropriate for the claim that \"794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since B.H. Obama took office, with no special recognition from the White House.\" The evidence provided by the article undermines this claim.\n\nFirstly, the Officer Down Memorial Page, which provides the number cited in the meme, counts deaths off-duty \"while acting in an official capacity to prevent loss of property, injury, or death, or is targeted because of his/her duties as a law enforcement officer.\" This includes deaths that occurred during training exercises, while on patrol, and during other official duties. The meme's number is likely higher than the actual number of officers killed in the line of duty since Obama took office, as it includes officers who died while acting in an official capacity but may not have been targeted because of their duties as law enforcement officers.\n\nSecondly, while the number of officers killed in the line of duty has increased in recent years, according to the FBI statistics, the number of deaths has declined noticeably in recent years. The meme's claim that there has been \"no special recognition from the White House\" for fallen officers is also incorrect. Obama has appeared at several events honoring fallen law enforcement officers, including a Presidential proclamation on Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service, and a White House Rose Garden ceremony honoring the National Association of Police Organizations \"Top Cops.\" These events demonstrate that the White House has acknowledged and honored the sacrifices of fallen law enforcement officers.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that 794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since Obama took office is false. The actual number of officers killed in the line of duty during this time period is likely lower than the meme's number, and the White House has indeed recognized and honored the sacrifices of these officers through various events and proclamations."

Marsha Blackburn that her congressional district has 10,000 medical-device industry jobs and 1,000 of them will be lost because of the health-care law tax is CONFLICTING. The evidence provided in the article challenges this claim in several ways:\n\n1. Job numbers: The article points out that Blackburn's estimate of 10,000 jobs in her congressional district is higher than the actual number of medical device manufacturing establishments with 8,871 employees in seven Tennessee counties, which is closer to 9,000.\n2. Shift in production: The study assumes that a 2.3 percent excise tax and a 10 percent shift in production offshore could lead to the loss of up to 146,218 jobs nationwide, including 1,023 jobs in Tennessee. However, the article questions whether this shift to overseas employment is a reasonable assumption, especially since there is no incentive to move production out of the country due to the tax exemption for devices made in the US for sale overseas.\n3. Price sensitivity: The article notes that health-related spending is relatively inelastic, meaning that when prices go up, demand falls by only a fraction as much. This suggests that the impact of the tax on demand for medical devices may not be as significant as Blackburn suggests.\n4. Underestimation: The industry trade group commissioned by AdvaMed may have underestimated the increased demand for medical devices under the Affordable Care Act, which could mitigate the impact of the tax on job losses.\n\nBased on these points, it is possible that Blackburn's claim of 10,000 medical-device industry jobs in her congressional district and the associated job loss due to the health-care law tax may be overstated or inconsistent with available data and evidence. Therefore, the label CONFLICTING is appropriate."

The article from WPRI indicates that Rep.

Petrarca may not have directly benefited from these bills as they relate to his own auto body shop, the article suggests that he has a personal stake in the issue due to his family's involvement in the auto body industry. This could be seen as a conflict of interest, as it could be argued that Rep. Petrarca's vote was influenced by his familial relationship with the industry rather than solely by the interests of his constituents.\n\nFurthermore, when confronted about the issue during an interview, Rep. Petrarca was unapologetic and dismissive of his opponent's claims, indicating that he may be more concerned with protecting the interests of the auto body industry than with serving the broader public interest. This lack of transparency and accountability could further support the label of \"True\" for the claim that Rep.

The evidence provided in the article supports the contrary: O'Rourke has no convictions on his record, and therefore there are zero collateral consequences vis-\u00e0-vis his ability to get a gun license under Texas law.\n\nThe article explains that O'Rourke was arrested for two misdemeanors in the 1990s: one for attempted forcible entry (a burglary offense) and one for driving while intoxicated. However, both cases were dismissed, and O'Rourke could purchase a gun legally without a permit or license under Texas law.\n\nFurthermore, the article notes that federal and state laws in Texas prevent a person from purchasing and possessing a gun if they have previously been convicted of a felony or certain misdemeanors related to domestic assault. However, neither O'Rourke's burglary nor his DWI offenses would disqualify him from legally purchasing and possessing a firearm today, as both cases were resolved more than five years ago.\n\nIn summary, the evidence provided in the article contradicts the claim that Beto O'Rourke wants to confiscate guns because he can't buy one himself due to his criminal record. Instead, it shows that O'Rourke is eligible to purchase and possess a gun legally under Texas law, and that there are no collateral consequences vis-\u00e0-vis his ability to get a gun license due to his past misdemeanor arrests.

However, when looking at the number of people moved out of poverty and jobs created from the year each president took office to the year they left office, the difference is not as substantial.\n\nWhile Bill Clinton's presidency did create more jobs than Reagan's, the ratio of people moved out of poverty to jobs created is not 100 times higher. The evidence shows that approximately 6.3 million people moved out of poverty during Clinton's administration, while 294,000 people moved out of poverty during Reagan's. This means that the ratio of people moved out of poverty to jobs created is approximately 21 times higher during Clinton's presidency, not 100 times higher as claimed in the statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label the claim as \"Conflicting.\" The statement exaggerates the difference in poverty reduction and job creation between the two presidents, and does not accurately represent the data provided."

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The claim that President Barack Obama said he did not have the authority to implement this type of anti-deportation measure 22 times before signing it into law is true. The evidence provided in the article supports this claim.\n\nFirstly, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas, who led the legal challenge against Obama's actions, stated that Obama was their star witness and mentioned 22 instances where Obama said he did not have the authority to implement such measures. This quote from Abbot is supported by the article which mentions Obama's exact wording, \"I just took an action to change the law,\" which he made five days after the administration's action was announced, not the next day.\n\nSecondly, the article provides a detailed analysis of recent history, including Obama's 2014 moves to forswear the deportation of unauthorized residents meeting certain conditions and his willingness to apply discretionary powers by issuing a \"deferred action\" directive that immigration officials not deport young immigrants who had not otherwise run afoul of the law. This demonstrates Obama's willingness to use executive authority to address immigration issues, which contradicts his claim that he did not have the authority to implement this type of measure.\n\nThirdly, the article cites a list of 15 instances from 2010 into 2014 where Obama said he couldn't do more to spare immigrants from deportation absent congressional action, which supports the claim that Obama did not have the authority to implement this type of measure.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that President Barack Obama stated multiple times that he did not have the authority to implement this type of anti-deportation measure before signing it into law. Therefore, the label \"True\" is justified."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim because the evidence provides conflicting estimates of the number of undocumented immigrants living in the United States. While some sources suggest that there are around 11 million to 13 million undocumented immigrants in the country, others estimate the number to be significantly higher or lower. For example, the Texas Federation of Republican Women suggests a range of 9-50 million undocumented immigrants, while the Pew Hispanic Center estimates that there are 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants in the country as of March 2011. The report from the Center for Immigration Studies also concludes that there are around 10.5 million illegal immigrants in the country in 2010. However, other sources suggest that the number could be significantly higher or lower than these estimates. For instance, the Department of Homeland Security report suggests that there were 11.5 million illegal immigrants living in the country in January 2011, while the Pew Hispanic Center estimates that the number has decreased to around 11.1 million since then. Therefore, based on the conflicting evidence provided, it is appropriate to label this claim as \"Conflicting.\""

While Weatherford claims that half of the people who would qualify for Medicaid expansion can buy a healthcare plan for $30 a month on the federal healthcare exchange, the article provides estimates that indicate this is not the case.\n\nAccording to the article, only about 23% of the 1.3 million uninsured Floridians who would be eligible for Medicaid expansion can buy insurance on the federal marketplace with tax credits. This means that Weatherford's claim is significantly exaggerated, and the actual number of people who can afford coverage on the exchange is much lower than he suggested.\n\nTherefore, the label \"Conflicting\" accurately reflects the discrepancy between Weatherford's claim and the evidence provided in the article."

    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim that the Obama administration spent taxpayer dollars on electric cars in Finland and windmills in China is false. The evidence provided in the article refutes this claim.\n\nFirstly, the loan guarantees given to Fisker Automotive were not part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (stimulus) but rather a program signed into existence by President George W. Bush in 2007 and first funded by legislation Bush signed in 2008. Therefore, the money did not come from the stimulus.\n\nSecondly, the engineering and design for the Karma were done in the United States, but according to the U.S. Energy Department, the plan from the beginning was to build the cars in Finland. However, the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers audits Fisker Automotive's accounts to ensure that all federal dollars are spent in the United States.\n\nThirdly, the claim about Chinese windmills has a challenging money trail as wind turbines are intricate and have components made from different places. However, according to the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group, only a tiny fraction of all turbines installed with stimulus dollars had Chinese components, representing less than 1 percent of the total.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the claim that the Obama administration spent taxpayer dollars on electric cars in Finland and windmills in China is false. The loan guarantees given to Fisker Automotive were not part of the stimulus, and the majority of the components used in wind turbines were not made in China.

The article provides data from the Department of Labor and Training, which shows that as of October 2012, there were approximately 50,000 local and state government jobs in Rhode Island, which represents about 11 percent of the state's total non-farm jobs. Even if you include federal government employees in the state, the number would still be less than half of Zaccaria's estimate.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label Mark Zaccaria's claim as false.

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim that the federal government has $3 trillion in cash flow and will not default on its obligations because we have $3 trillion in cash flow so we can pay our bills. This is because while the evidence provided suggests that the government has a significant amount of cash flow, it also indicates that there are potential risks and uncertainties associated with paying all bills on time.\n\nFirstly, the evidence highlights that the government's cash flow may not be enough to cover all its obligations, particularly if incoming revenue falls behind spending demands. According to the Congressional Budget Office-projected $3 trillion in revenue stands to be outpaced by predicted expenditures of $3.6 trillion in the fiscal year, which raises questions about whether there will be days when cash flow undershoots what must be paid.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that there is uncertainty at the Treasury regarding how it would prioritize its payments in the event of cash-flow slowing. The Congressional Research Service floated opposite speculations, and the Government Accountability Office said in a 1985 letter to the then-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that the Treasury is \"free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the United States.\" This raises concerns about whether the government has a clear strategy to prioritize its payments in the event of cash flow shortages.\n\nThirdly, the evidence notes that if the ceiling is not raised, the government isn't expected to have sufficient cash to meet all obligations in a timely manner past the beginning of November 2013, at latest. This raises questions about what would happen if the government were to default on its obligations, and whether the label \"default\" is appropriate in this context.\n\nBased on these factors, it can be argued that while the claim that the federal government has $3 trillion in cash flow and will not default on its obligations may be technically correct, there are potential risks and uncertainties associated with paying all bills on time. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim."

    "justification": "The claim that tuition at Rutgers has increased by 10% since Gov. Chris Christie took office is conflicting because the evidence provided contradicts this statement. According to the article, the tuition at Rutgers increased by 7.97% during Christie's tenure as governor, not 10%. Additionally, the article states that Buono specifically referenced a tuition increase, so the comparison of fees from 2009-2010 to 2013-2014 was removed, resulting in an increase of 12.27% which is also less than 10%.\n\nMoreover, the article highlights that Gov. Christie's cuts to higher education funding have long-reaching effects on students, but he has no role in setting tuition costs at colleges and universities. The Rutgers Board of Governors sets tuition and determines the rates of tuition for the institution as part of the university\u2019s annual budget. Therefore, it is unfair to blame Gov. Christie solely for the increase in tuition at Rutgers.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that tuition at Rutgers has increased by 10% since Gov. Chris Christie took office is conflicting and should be labeled as such."

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "Based on the provided evidence, Hillary Clinton's claim that \"23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get treatment\" can be considered True. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated that 22.7 million Americans needed treatment for a drug or alcohol problem, but only about 2.5 million received treatment at a specialty facility. This ratio of 11% is consistent with prior findings and estimates, as stated by Arthur Robinson Williams, a fellow in the division on substance abuse in Columbia University's Department of Psychiatry.\n\nThe definition of \"specialty facility\" used in the survey refers to treatment received at drug or alcohol rehabilitation facilities (inpatient or outpatient), hospitals (inpatient services only), and mental health centers; it excludes treatment received in an emergency room, private doctor's office, self-help group, prison or jail, or hospital as an outpatient. While some forms of treatment may not be included in the survey, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous, the number of participants in these groups is substantial, with 1,283,704 members in the United States as of Jan. 1, 2015, plus an additional 35,349 in correctional facilities.\n\nDavid Rosenbloom, a professor of health policy and management at the Boston University School of Public Health, notes that treatment in doctor's offices is a relatively recent development, but many people with addiction could be treated in the regular medical care system. Arthur L. Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at the New York University Langone Medical Center, confirms that Clinton's claim is mainly right.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, Hillary Clinton's claim that \"23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get treatment\" can be considered True. The ratio of people who conceivably could have needed treatment at a specialty facility to those who actually received it is approximately 11%, which is supported by prior findings and estimates. While some forms of treatment may not be included in the survey, the number of participants in groups such as AA and Narcotics Anonymous is substantial."

    "justification": "The claim that \"In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths\" is misleading and should be labeled as Conflicting. The evidence provided by the article does not support this claim.\n\nFirstly, the study mentioned in the article found that 45% of US high school students reported texting while driving during the previous 30 days, but it did not directly compare texting and drinking while driving. Therefore, it is difficult to determine which one is the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths.\n\nSecondly, the article notes that there is a correlation between texting while driving and other risky behaviors on the road, such as not wearing a seatbelt and riding with a driver who has been drinking alcohol. This suggests that it is not necessarily texting itself that is the problem, but rather a broader culture of risky behavior among teen drivers.\n\nThirdly, the article cites Deb Trombley from the National Safety Council, who notes that there isn't good data on cell phone use in accidents, and that it goes down as distracted driving. This suggests that the statistics on texting while driving may not be accurate or complete.\n\nFinally, the article provides data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which found that 12% of teen-aged drivers involved in fatal crashes were distracted in some way, with 24% of those distracted drivers using a cell phone. By comparison, 20% of 14 to 18-year-old drivers involved in a fatal crash had some level of alcohol in their system. This suggests that while texting may be a contributing factor in teen driving deaths, it is not the only factor and may not even be the leading factor.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is unclear whether texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths in 2011. The study does not provide direct evidence to support this claim, and other factors such as a broader culture of risky behavior among teen drivers and incomplete data on cell phone use in accidents may also be at play. Therefore, the label Conflicting is appropriate."

The evidence provided in the article shows that McConnell's net worth increased significantly after he married Chao in 1993, but it does not suggest that he made millions as a senator. In fact, the article states that McConnell's salary as a senator has not changed since 1985 and that his wealth comes primarily from Chao's inheritance and her father's business success.

    "justification": "The claim that President Obama's healthcare plan creates a \"death panel\" or \"rationing board\" that will lead to denied care for current seniors is CONFLICTING. The evidence provided in the article disputes this claim in several ways:\n\n1. The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) is not an unelected, unaccountable body as claimed by Ryan. Its members are appointed by the President and approved by the Senate, and they can be removed for cause. They are also required to follow disclosure and ethics guidelines, and their recommendations can be rejected by Congress.\n2. The IPAB is not responsible for cutting Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors. While it is required to recommend cost-saving measures if Medicare grows too quickly, these recommendations can be overridden by Congress. Additionally, the law reduces Medicare's growth by more than $700 billion over the next 10 years, which would reduce the need for IPAB recommendations.\n3. The article notes that the board cannot ration care, change benefits, change eligibility, or increase what seniors pay. Therefore, it is unlikely that the board's recommendations would lead to denied care for current seniors.\n4. Even if the board were to make recommendations that reduced payments to providers, this would not necessarily lead to denied care for seniors. The article notes that some providers say they are underpaid already, and reducing payments to these providers could potentially affect their ability to provide care. However, it is not clear that this would lead to denied care for current seniors.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim about President Obama's healthcare plan creating a \"death panel\" or \"rationing board\" that will lead to denied care for current seniors is CONFLICTING.

The evidence provided by PolitiFact Ohio refutes this assertion.\n\nFirstly, the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) is not a commission of unelected bureaucrats as claimed by Blackburn. According to the law, the members of IPAB shall include individuals with national recognition for their expertise in health finance and economics, actuarial science, health facility management, health plans and integrated delivery systems, reimbursement of health facilities, allopathic and osteopathic physicians, and other providers of health services, and other related fields, who provide a mix of different professionals, broad geographic representation, and a balance between urban and rural representatives (PolitiFact Ohio). This means that IPAB members are not unelected bureaucrats but rather experts in their respective fields.\n\nSecondly, the board is not empowered to make life-and-death decisions as claimed by Blackburn and Gingrey. The law states that IPAB cannot raise costs to Medicare recipients, much less kill them off by denying life-saving care (PolitiFact Georgia). Instead, IPAB's role is to recommend cost-savings proposals within a mandate that specifies it cannot ration care. The board might recommend, based on medical best practices, that every discharged hospital patient gets guidance on wound care or that they drink plenty of cold water (PolitiFact Georgia).\n\nThirdly, the claim that IPAB would make medical decisions for patients is false. According to Cato Institute, a libertarian thinktank usually at odds with Democratic positions, the assertion that the IPAB would be controlling patients health-care decisions is \"not even close to correct\" (PolitiFact Georgia). The board exists to rein in costs, a job Congress has repeatedly declined to undertake, as this Washington Post editorial, among others, has pointed out.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence provided by PolitiFact Ohio, Georgia, and Cato Institute refutes Blackburn's claim that President Obama and his allies in Congress gave \"power\" to control Medicare patients' health care decisions to \"a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington.\" IPAB members are not unelected bureaucrats, but rather experts in their respective fields. Additionally, the board is not empowered to make life-and-death decisions or control patients' health care decisions. Therefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate for this claim."

    "justification": "The claim that Ann Kuster \"supports the government takeover of healthcare, which robs Medicare of over $700 billion\" is False. The evidence provided in the article refutes this claim.\n\nFirstly, the term \"government takeover\" has been defined by PolitiFact as having no basis in reality. It is a political dynamic that conservatives use to label any increase in government authority in healthcare as a 'takeover'. Therefore, the claim that Kuster supports a government takeover of healthcare is misleading.\n\nSecondly, the Affordable Care Act does not include a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers, as claimed by Bass. Instead, employers will continue to provide health insurance to most patients through private insurance companies. The law also includes changes seeking to lower future Medicare costs, which were debated in the open and included in the law to avoid adding to the deficit. These reductions have been projected to total around $716 billion between 2013 and 2022, but they do not constitute \"robbing\" Medicare.\n\nLastly, PolitiFact has disagreed strongly with the classification of the Affordable Care Act as a government takeover of healthcare, and has given Mitt Romney's similar claim a rating of Half True. This suggests that while the law does include reductions in Medicare spending, it does not constitute \"robbing\" the program of funds.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the claim that Kuster supports a government takeover of healthcare and robs Medicare of over $700 billion is False. The evidence provided in the article refutes this claim and shows that the Affordable Care Act does not constitute a government takeover of healthcare or rob Medicare of funds."

The district also plans to draw on reserves and use other funds to pay for the bond issuance, which will help keep the tax rate flat. Additionally, the district's worst-case modeling indicates that even if total assessed property values grow more than expected, the increase in the debt portion of the district tax rate will be less than the increase in the taxes paid by homeowners. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it is accurate to say that the proposed bond issue will not result in a tax rate increase."

Of the eight bills introduced by Kihuen in 2015, only one was ultimately signed into law - a bill allowing the county commissioners in Las Vegas to propose up to a $14 fee on marriage licenses to promote marriage tourism. While Kihuen worked closely with Republican Assistant Majority Leader Ben Kieckhefer in passing the state's first need-based college scholarship program, the majority of his introduced bills did not pass.\n\nFlores' allegation that Kihuen was ineffective is mostly on the mark. Of the ten bills introduced by Kihuen during the 2015 session, only one was signed into law. While Kihuen served as part of the leadership team for the 10-person Democratic caucus and Senate Democratic head Aaron Ford praised his work during the legislative session, the fact remains that only one of his introduced bills passed.\n\nThe article also highlights the challenge in measuring legislative effectiveness based solely on the raw numbers of bills proposed and laws passed. Factors such as majority or minority status, seniority, and the limited number of bills lawmakers can propose during the session can impact passage rates. Therefore, it is important to consider other factors when evaluating a lawmaker's effectiveness.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, Lucy Flores' claim that Ruben Kihuen only managed to pass one bill out of the eight to ten he introduced during the 2015 legislative session is supported by the facts. While Kihuen's work on college affordability and scholarships is commendable, his low passage rate for his introduced bills speaks to his effectiveness as a lawmaker."

The evidence provided in the article supports this claim.\n\nFirstly, the article quotes Rick Perry, the former Governor of Texas, who boasted about the state's job creation record during his tenure. According to Perry, Texas created almost one-third of all the nation's new jobs, with a total of 441,000 jobs created in the last year alone. This is supported by figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which show that Texas saw civilian employment balloon by 1.36 million jobs from December 2007 to October 2014, while the rest of the country saw a gain of 0.26% and more than 350,000 jobs below the December 2007 level.\n\nSecondly, the article provides a chart showing that based on total employment, which includes all jobs including self-employed posts, Texas had 1,410,400 more jobs in November 2014 than it had in December 2007, while the rest of the country had 352,440 fewer jobs. This further supports the claim that Texas created more jobs than the rest of the country during the specified period.\n\nFinally, the article quotes Mark J. Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan campus in Flint, who notes that Texas never experienced significant job losses during the Great Recession while the rest of the country did.

The NSF spokeswoman, Dana Topousis, confirmed that the grant was awarded in 2010 to a theatre company in Brooklyn, NY, to develop an innovative approach to exposing U.S. citizens to science through a touring play with songs and video. The summary of the grant award describes the musical as exploring the relationship between humans and the environment, focusing on critical issues of climate change and biodiversity conservation, using real places and stories drawn from interviews conducted by the artists to create an experience that is part investigative journalism and part inventive theatre.\n\nThe evidence provided shows that the NSF awarded a grant to fund a musical about climate change, which aligns with the claim made in the article. The musical is described as using real places and stories to create an experience that educates the public about the importance of science studies in understanding our place in the natural world. Additionally, the NSF spokeswoman confirmed that the grant was awarded in 2010, which supports the claim made in the article. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim."

    "justification": "The claim that there are 352 House bills \"sitting on Harry Reid's desk awaiting action,\" including 55 introduced by Democrats, is appropriate given the evidence provided. The article cites the THOMAS congressional database, which shows that 342 individual bills have passed the House so far this year, with only a few categories of bills excluded from the count. While the number may be slightly lower than Jenkins' claim of 352, it is still a significant amount of legislation waiting for action in the Senate.\n\nFurthermore, the article provides evidence that the Senate is not taking up these House-passed bills, with experts stating that both parties share some blame for the lack of action. The article also notes that Reid has influence over what committee chairs do, which can affect whether a bill comes over from the House or not. Therefore, it is appropriate to label this claim as \"Conflicting.\"\n\nAdditionally, while Jenkins' statement mentions 55 introduced by Democrats, the evidence provided shows that only 24 of these bills are substantive measures, with the remainder being technical changes or non-controversial bills. This suggests that the number of Democratic-introduced bills awaiting action in the Senate may be lower than Jenkins' claim.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label the claim that there are 352 House bills \"sitting on Harry Reid's desk awaiting action,\" including 55 introduced by Democrats, as \"Conflicting.\" While some progress has been made in identifying the number of House-passed bills waiting for action in the Senate, further investigation is needed to accurately determine the exact number and nature of these bills."

    "justification": "The claim that \"In one Colorado hospital, 50 percent of newborns tested had marijuana in their system\" is misleading and should be labeled as conflicting. While it is true that some newborn babies in Colorado have tested positive for marijuana, the evidence provided does not support the claim that half of all newborns in the hospital have marijuana in their system.\n\nThe ad cited by Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy uses a single month's worth of data to make their claim, which is an unfair representation of the actual numbers. As the hospital spokesperson pointed out, the screening criteria was developed by both local hospitals and Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado, and babies have been drug tested at the hospital for at least a decade. The ad cherry-picks one month of data to make the number of newborns who test positive for marijuana seem higher than it actually is.\n\nFurthermore, the ad does not provide any context or comparison to similar hospitals or states where marijuana is not legal. Without this information, it is impossible to accurately assess the rate of newborns testing positive for marijuana.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim of 50 percent of newborns having marijuana in their system is an exaggeration and should be labeled as conflicting. While marijuana use during and after pregnancy can have harmful effects on a baby's brain and behavior, the actual number of newborns testing positive for marijuana is significantly lower than what the ad suggests."

    "justification": "The label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim \"If someone is in a room that has measles and leaves and you walk in two hours later, you could get measles from that person.\" The evidence provided supports this claim.\n\nFirstly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed. This means that if other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, they can become infected.\n\nSecondly, the article states that the measles virus stays in the nose and throat mucus of someone who has the infection, which makes it easy to catch. In fact, the CDC says that if one person catches it, a whopping 90 percent of people who are not immune (i.e., did not have the vaccine due to weak immune system, age or personal choice) close to the infected person will also become infected.\n\nThirdly, the article quotes Dr. Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center, who confirms the accuracy of Cohen's statement. Troisi explains that \"Just being in the room where someone with measles has been 30 minutes earlier can expose you.\"\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the claim \"If someone is in a room that has measles and leaves and you walk in two hours later, you could get measles from that person\" is supported by the evidence provided. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim."

The evidence presented in the article supports this claim, stating that domestic crude oil production surpassed crude oil imports in October 2013 for the first time since 1995 and that the United States produced an average of 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in October while importing 7.5 million barrels of oil per day. These numbers add up to more than the total amount of oil imported from other countries, which supports the claim.\n\nThe article also provides an explanation for why this is happening, citing increased production domestically and reduced demand as reasons for the shift. The author mentions that innovation in regulatory infrastructure has also played a role in increasing domestic production, including factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights and open access to pipelines. While the article does not specifically attribute this development to any one president, it does acknowledge President Obama's support of energy efficiency and his administration's fuel efficiency standards as a factor in reducing the country's dependency on foreign oil.\n\nOverall, the evidence presented in the article supports the claim that the United States is producing more oil than it imports for the first time in nearly two decades, and provides a plausible explanation for why this is happening. Therefore, the label True is appropriate."

The article cites a map and research conducted by The Austin Bulldog, which found that 55% of elected officials in Austin have lived in four ZIP codes from 1971 through 2011.\n2. The article also notes that these four ZIP codes accounted for 58 of the 117 city offices filled in Austin elections (City Council including mayor) from 1971 through 2011, which divides out to 49.6 percent.\n3. When asked about the discrepancy between the stated percentage and the actual number of mayors counted, the group's leader, Ken Martin, explained that his volunteer had made a mistake in the spreadsheet. Even with this error, the basic point remains true.\n4.

The video interviewed by the Center for Medical Progress does not show any footage of an actual aborted fetus with a beating heart and kicking legs. While the former procurement technician Holly O'Donnell describes seeing a fully-formed aborted fetus in a pathology lab at a California Planned Parenthood clinic, there is no evidence to suggest that this fetus was still alive when it was examined. In fact, the supervisor in O'Donnell's story does not say anything about keeping the fetus alive specifically for the purpose of harvesting the brain.\n\nMoreover, the video produced by the Center for Medical Progress cuts to a fetus outside the womb, placed on what appears to be some sort of examination surface, and the fetus' legs are moving. However, it is unclear where this footage came from, under what conditions it was obtained, or even if this fetus was actually aborted (as opposed to a premature birth or miscarriage).\n\nIn conclusion, while there is some evidence to suggest that Planned Parenthood has been involved in the procurement of fetal tissue for medical research, there is no evidence to support Carly Fiorina's claim about one of the Planned Parenthood videos showing an alive fetus with a beating heart and kicking legs.

    "justification": "The label \"False\" is appropriate for the claim that \"A North Carolina study proves that 'probably over a million people voted twice in (the 2012) election.'\" The evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim. Firstly, the report from the North Carolina Board of Elections found 765 voters who matched on each category with someone who voted elsewhere during the 2012 general election, which is a small number compared to the claim of \"over a million people.\" Additionally, the larger group based on name and birth date had a proportion that was likely to be abused, but the scale of the problem was overstated. The Interstate Crosscheck program itself showed how quickly the scale can drop from massive to minuscule. Furthermore, the article highlighted that basic statistics make it even tougher to say this process picks out the same person in two states. The author also noted that outside of the Interstate Crosscheck system, the number of people who vote twice seems low. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, the claim is false."

    "justification": "Sure! Based on the evidence provided in the article, Bernie Sanders' claim that \"Flint, Mich., is paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vt., for clean water\" is appropriate.\n\nThe article provides data on the average annual water bills for Flint and Burlington residents. In January 2015, Flint's average water bill was $910 per year, while Burlington's was $321 per year. After a judge ruled that Flint's rates had to be rolled back, Flint's residential water rates were approximately 55% higher than Burlington's.\n\nUsing the data provided in the article, we can calculate the difference between Flint and Burlington's water rates as follows:\n\nFlint's average annual water bill (2015) = $910\nBurlington's average annual water bill (2015) = $321\nDifference in water rates = $689 ($910 - $321)\n\nTherefore, Bernie Sanders' claim that Flint is paying three times more for poison water than he is paying for clean water in Burlington is supported by the evidence provided. The difference in water rates between Flint and Burlington is approximately 3.6 times ($689 / $192 = 3.6).\n\nIt's worth noting that the article does not provide information on the quality of the water in Flint compared to Burlington, which could also impact the cost of water service. However, based on the data provided, it appears that Bernie Sanders' claim is accurate at least in terms of the difference in water rates between the two cities."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label the claim \"The United States has not completed a 'top-to-bottom review of our criminal justice system at the national level since 1965\" as True. The article text provides several pieces of evidence that support this claim:\n\nFirstly, Senator John Cornyn's statement during a call with Texas reporters on June 11 confirms that there has not been a federal review of the criminal justice system at the national level since 1965. This statement is backed up by the fact that President Donald Trump directed the formation of a commission through an executive order last year, sidestepping the need for legislative action.\n\nSecondly, the article highlights the existence of a standalone bill that would have created a commission to study ways to reduce crime and improve policing across the country. This bill was introduced before Trump created the commission, but it is still significant because it shows that there has been an ongoing effort to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the criminal justice system at the national level.\n\nThirdly, the article mentions that similar commissions have been established in the past, such as the Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice created by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. This commission came at a time when there was a need to address the country's crime problem, and it resulted in over 200 recommendations, many of which are still well-known today.\n\nFinally, the article quotes Marc Levin, founder and chief of policy and innovation at the conservative criminal justice initiative Right on Crime, who confirms that no such commission has been formed since Johnson's in 1965. This suggests that there has been a lack of comprehensive reviews of the criminal justice system at the national level in recent years.\n\nBased on these pieces of evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim \"The United States has not completed a 'top-to-bottom review of our criminal justice system at the national level since 1965\" is true."

Additionally, the article states that the number of testing dates in Texas schools has increased over the years in response to state and federal mandates, which supports the claim that there are numerous testing dates in the Austin school district.\n\nMoreover, the article provides evidence that students in some grades could re-take the Mathematics and Science TAKS, and other tests on the month's calendar include grade-specific STAARs in English, writing, math, and reading. This suggests that there are multiple testing opportunities throughout the year. Furthermore, the article mentions that the district administration does not develop practice versions of the TAKS and STAAR, but some campuses may use state-released (test) items to help students feel comfortable before testing begins.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the article, it can be concluded that there are numerous testing dates in the Austin school district, which supports the claim.

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, the label \"False\" is appropriate for the claim that the Medicaid expansion in Florida will cost the state $1.9 billion a year. Here's why:\n\n1. The estimate of $1.9 billion is based on an assumption that there are people who currently qualify for Medicaid but have not enrolled, and that they would come forward under the new system. However, the state's own Agency for Health Care Administration found that this assumption is overstated, as many of these individuals may already be eligible for Medicaid through other programs.\n2. The estimate also assumes that people who are currently purchasing private insurance would abandon their plans and enroll in Medicaid under the expansion. However, the agency's report found that this assumption is also overstated, as many of these individuals may prefer to keep their private insurance or cannot afford Medicaid premiums.\n3. The state estimates the number of people who would be eligible for the Medicaid expansion and apply, but this estimate is based on a rough calculation and may not accurately reflect the actual number of people who would enroll.\n4. The state's most generous estimate is that the Medicaid changes as part of the federal health care law will cost the state about $1.47 billion a year starting in 2020. However, this estimate includes costs for increased rates for Medicaid primary care physicians, which are not directly related to the Medicaid expansion.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the estimate of $1.9 billion in costs for the Medicaid expansion in Florida is overstated and cannot be supported by the evidence provided.

The federal Army Corps of Engineers devised a plan to fix the problem, but due to an earmark ban and gridlock in Congress, the project has been held up. Despite this, Governor Scott pushed the Legislature to set aside $36 million for the project, which was matched by the port with $500,000 and the federal Army Corps of Engineers with $1.5 million. While the state's investment is part of a trend under Governor Scott not to wait for federal dollars, the Mile Point project remains held up due to lack of congressional authorization.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the evidence and can be labeled as True."

It was not a vote on final passage of the bill and therefore could not have resulted in any increase in Medicare costs for current seniors.\n\nSecondly, even if the Ryan budget had been passed, it would not have directly affected individuals 55 or older, including Don Disney, the retiree featured in Grimes' ad. The proposal repealed the Affordable Care Act, which would have affected prescription drug costs for seniors, but the evidence does not provide a concrete figure for how much these costs would increase.\n\nLastly, the $6,000 figure used in the ad is based on studies that looked at what a 65-year-old would pay in 2022 under the Ryan plan. However, as noted in the article, Don Disney is 75 years old, which means he would not have been affected by any changes to Medicare under the Ryan plan.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that McConnell's vote did not result in a $6,000 increase in Medicare costs for current Kentucky seniors, and therefore Grimes' claim is False."

Data from the CDC shows that roughly 6% of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States have been among people 17 years old and under, with 2.3% being people under 9 and 4.8% between 10 and 19.

Across the United States, 29 people under the age of 14 and 142 people between the ages of 15 and 24 have died after contracting the virus. In Texas, state data does not show any coronavirus fatalities for people younger than 19, but media reports suggest that some children have died after contracting the virus.\n3. Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, chief of Pediatric Infectious Disease at UT Southwestern Medical Center, told NBC DFW in a July 3 interview that children are able to contract and transmit the virus.

The ad takes a quote from a Democratic politician and a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis out of context to make it seem like Republicans voted to end Medicare. However, the evidence shows that the Republican proposal does not end Medicare, but rather modifies the program to save money.\n\nFirstly, the ad misleadingly implies that all seniors would have to find $12,500 to pay for healthcare, without mentioning that this amount includes money that beneficiaries would already contribute in premiums under current law. The CBO estimate cited in the ad suggests that beneficiaries would contribute around $6,350 extra under the Republican proposal, not $12,500.\n\nSecondly, the ad falsely implies that Republicans voted to end Medicare without any evidence to support this claim. The vote referred to in the ad was a budget resolution that states policy preferences but does not actually change Medicare. As an elder law expert, Richard Kaplan agrees that nobody voted to end Medicare and that the Republicans' proposal aims to modify the program, not eliminate it.\n\nLastly, the ad selectively edits the CBO analysis to support its misleading narrative. While the CBO analysis does conclude that future beneficiaries would pay more for current levels of coverage under the Republican proposal, it also finds that the plan will save money and that Medicare's budget will increase every year.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, the claim made in the ad is false. The Republicans' proposal modifies Medicare, but does not end it, and the ad misleadingly exaggerates the impact of the proposal on seniors."

The question asked was clear and specific, and the responses were dichotomous, making it easier to interpret the results.\n\nWhile there are some quibbles with the poll, such as the fact that it was paid for by an environmental group, this does not inherently discredit the results. It is worth noting that polls paid for by organizations with a stake in the issue can be more credible than those conducted independently, as they are less likely to have a vested interest in skewing the results.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that a higher percentage of 30-49 year olds deny the existence of climate change does not necessarily undermine the accuracy of the 3 percent result. The two polls use different age ranges, and it is possible that the responses vary depending on the age group.

Similarly, the ACT reports that 60% of Texas high school graduates demonstrated college readiness in English, 47% in math, and 36% in science in 2014.\n\nBased on these figures, it can be concluded that there was an increase in the percentage of students meeting college readiness standards in Texas between 2005 and 2013. The evidence provided supports the claim that before 2005, the percentage of students meeting these standards was lower than it was in 2013."

    "claim": "\"Estimates say individuals who escaped these high tax states have taken with them around $2 trillion in adjusted gross income.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" accurately reflects the ambiguity present in the provided evidence. While the article suggests that individuals have taken with them around $2 trillion in adjusted gross income when moving from high-tax states to low-tax states, there are several limitations and criticisms of Brown's methodology that call into question the accuracy of this claim.\n\nFirstly, Brown's book and website tool rely on IRS data and Census records, but it is not clear whether the $2 trillion number represents all money moving out of high-tax states or simply the sum of adjusted gross income moving across states. This critical distinction is not made clear in Brown's work, according to economist Michael Mazerov.\n\nSecondly, while Florida has gained residents from high-tax states like New York and Illinois, it has also lost residents to other states with lower taxes, such as North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Arizona, and Texas. This suggests that tax rates may not be the sole determining factor in migration decisions.\n\nThirdly, research shows that taxes are not a major consideration for people who move between states, with only around 2% of Americans moving between states in any given year. Other factors like new jobs, better weather, nearby family, and housing costs are much more important.\n\nFinally, the University of Florida's Population Program has found that jobs are the main reason people move to Florida, while climate is biggest for people in their 50s and 60s. One major factor common to all age groups? Family living in the area.\n\nIn conclusion, while Brown's book provides some evidence to support the claim that individuals have taken with them around $2 trillion in adjusted gross income when moving from high-tax states to low-tax states, there are several limitations and criticisms of his methodology that call into question the accuracy of this claim. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate."

The evidence provided in the article supports this claim.\n\nIn 2010-11, the Democratic-led budget passed by Governor John Lynch and Senate President Maggie Hassan ended with a $17.7 million surplus, which roughly matches the Democratic Party's claim of $18 million. This is supported by the article's mention of a state annual report that identified a $17.7 million surplus by the end of the year, despite relying heavily on borrowing and one-time federal funds to balance the budget.\n\nOn the other hand, the 2012-13 budget, led by Republican Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley and former House Speaker William O'Brien, is projected to have a $40.7 million revenue shortfall, most of which comes from shortages in Medicaid Expansion Tax revenues ($36.8 million). This projection is supported by the article's mention of a Fiscal Year 2013 snapshot released by the budget assistant's office, which reported a $40.7 million revenue shortfall.\n\nWhile the projections can change frequently, as mentioned in the article, the initial projection for the 2012-13 budget was for a deficit, and this projection has been confirmed by the monthly revenue report released on April 2, which showed revenues up $26.6 million over the initial budget projections, potentially closing the gap.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim that the 2010-11 New Hampshire budget ended with an $18 million surplus, while the Republican-led 2012-13 budget has a $40 million deficit, is True."

    "justification": "The claim that the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina was first flown at the statehouse in 1961 as a symbol of massive resistance to racial desegregation is supported by the evidence provided.\n\nFirstly, the article quotes Daniel Hollis, a member of the commission responsible for planning South Carolina's Confederate War Centennial, who recalled the exact day the flag was first hoisted during an interview published in 1999. According to Hollis, the flag itself went up on April 11, 1961, for the opening of the Civil War centennial \"at the request of Aiken Rep. John A. May.\" This indicates that the flag was first flown at the statehouse in 1961.\n\nSecondly, Eugene Robinson, a columnist for The Washington Post, provides historical context to explain why the flag was flown as a symbol of massive resistance to racial desegregation. He cites a study conducted by the state Senate of Georgia that explores the different Confederate flags that have existed and their meanings. According to the study, from the end of the Civil War until the late 1940s, display of the battle flag was mostly limited to Confederate commemorations, Civil War re-enactments, and veterans' parades. However, in 1948, the meaning of the flag began to change as Dixiecrats flew the flag at their convention in Birmingham, Alabama, as a symbol of Southern protest and resistance to the federal government. In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown vs. Board that segregation in education was unconstitutional, and Georgia changed its state flag to embody the Confederate battle flag two years later. This period also saw Rosa Parks refuse to give up her seat on the bus (1955), the forced integration at Little Rock, Arkansas (1957), and student sit-ins across the South (1960). Prince K. Michael, author of Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys: South Carolina and the Confederate Flag, also acknowledges that it is possible that nobody had anything else in mind other than commemorating the war, but he emphasizes that we must consider the larger context in judging the meaning of the display.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the Confederate battle flag was first flown at the South Carolina statehouse in 1961 as a symbol of massive resistance to racial desegregation. The flag's changing meaning over time is also explored, highlighting how it went from being primarily limited to Confederate commemorations to being used as a symbol of Southern protest and resistance to the federal government."

The article states that while there have been raises in teacher pay over the last three years, the amount of the raise is significantly less than what Berger claimed. Specifically, the raise has been around 10.8%, not the 15% claimed by Berger.\n\nThe evidence provided includes a document from the state legislature that tracks pay changes for teachers and state employees each year since the 1970s, which backs up Berger's claim. However, upon closer inspection of this document, it is revealed that part of the raise is due to the removal of annual longevity bonuses for veteran teachers, which actually resulted in some veteran teachers making less money overall.\n\nAdditionally, the article notes that only two-thirds of teacher pay comes from the state's portion, with the rest coming from local school districts. This means that Berger's claim is not inclusive of the full amount of raises teachers have received.\n\nBased on these facts, it is clear that Berger's claim of a 15% raise in teacher pay over the last three years is incorrect and misleading.

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, the label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim that more than 1,300 people will have died on Georgia roads by the end of 2015, and one out of every four fatalities resulted from drunken driving. Here's why:\n\nThe article cites figures compiled by the state Department of Transportation and released through the Governor\u2019s Office of Highway Safety, which show that traffic deaths in Georgia fell each year from 2005 to 2014, going from 1,729 to 1,170. However, the article notes that traffic deaths in Georgia for 2015 hit 1,345 as of Monday of this week, which is an increase of 16% compared to the previous year.\n\nThe article also provides information on the breakdown of fatalities by type of road and the role of alcohol in these deaths. According to state data, the largest number of traffic deaths occurred on state and local roads, with 675 and 485 fatalities, respectively. However, deaths on interstates - often the most visible because of the gridlock that follows - are up 21% from the previous year, with 185 fatalities so far this year.\n\nThe article also notes that while officials don't know for certain the role of alcohol in 2015 traffic deaths, they have certified data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showing that 297 of Georgia\u2019s 1,179 fatalities two years ago, or 25%, involved alcohol blood content of 0.08, the legal limit. Additionally, smaller amounts of alcohol - 0.01% or higher - were found in 30% of those fatalities in 2013, according to Blackwood.\n\nBased on these figures and the information provided by the article, it is reasonable to conclude that more than 1,300 people will have died on Georgia roads by the end of 2015, and one out of every four fatalities resulted from drunken driving. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim."

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis provided in the article shows that a six-year reauthorization of CHIP would produce an additional $8.204 billion in revenue, but only $7.223 billion in additional costs, resulting in a cumulative savings of $981 million. Similarly, a 10-year reauthorization is projected to decrease the deficit by $6 billion over the 2018-2027 period. This suggests that CHIP saves the government money because the alternatives cost more. The popularity of the program across party lines and the positive CBO score further support the claim.

    "justification": "The claim that the percentage of black children born without a father in the home has risen from 7% in 1964 to 73% today, due to changes from President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society, is False. The evidence provided in the article disputes this claim in several ways:\n\nFirstly, there is no federal data on \"black children born without a father in the home\". Instead, the article analyzes two types of data that are similar but not a perfect fit: unmarried black births as a percentage of all black births and the percentage of black children living without a father in the home. However, these measurements offer limited support for the claim, with the overall increase being more limited than the meme suggests.\n\nSecondly, the article notes that rates of fatherlessness among both whites and blacks have increased over time, with a tripling of the percentage of white children living in single-mother households between 1960 and 2013. This suggests that the increase in black single parenthood cannot be solely attributed to changes from the Great Society.\n\nThirdly, the article highlights that the data for both black and white marriage is unreliable, with many black mothers misreporting their marital status and young white women getting married and divorced repeatedly. This could mean that the frequency of non-marital births among African Americans may have been higher than officially indicated, and the white rate of non-marital births may have been artificially low.\n\nFinally, the article emphasizes that correlation does not equal causation, with many other factors contributing to the rise in single-motherhood rates for both blacks and whites. The article concludes that while the Great Society may have had some impact on single motherhood rates, it is unlikely to be the primary cause of the observed increase.\n\nBased on these points, it is reasonable to label the claim as False, as the evidence provided does not support the suggested increase in black children born without a father in the home due to changes from President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society."

While she has signed pledges disavowing higher taxes and has expressed support for phasing out property taxes in favor of an existing sales tax, there is no direct evidence of her advocating for a 35% sales tax rate extension to medicine, groceries, real estate, and other essential items.\n\nThe closest evidence to support this claim can be found in a KVUE-TV news story from 2010, where Campbell is quoted as saying that income taxes and payroll taxes should be replaced with a 23% federal sales tax on consumer goods and services. However, it's important to note that this quote does not explicitly mention extending the sales tax rate to specific items like medicine, groceries, and real estate.\n\nMoreover, Campbell's campaign website and public statements do not reflect any support for a 35% state-federal-local sales tax rate extension.

    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim made by Senator Marco Rubio that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) adds around $800 billion of taxes on the American people and does not discriminate between rich and poor is false. The evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim in several ways.\n\nFirstly, the report commissioned by Republican House Speaker John Boehner to estimate the cost of repealing the healthcare law found that repealing it would result in $813 billion in lost revenues for the government between 2012 and 2021. This suggests that the ACA actually generates revenue for the government, rather than adding taxes.\n\nSecondly, the article explains that the ACA creates several new revenue sources, including a tax penalty for people who do not have health insurance and a tax on indoor tanning. However, these taxes are not simply added onto existing taxes without any deductions or credits. The law also provides tax credits to low- and moderate-income families, which would reduce the amount of taxes they owe. Therefore, it is important to subtract these tax credits and subsidies when calculating the net \"tax increase\" over 10 years, as suggested by Chapin White, a former CBO staffer. According to White, the more appropriate net tax increase over 10 years is around $20 billion, rather than $800 billion as claimed by Rubio.\n\nThirdly, the article notes that the ACA's individual mandate requires most everyone to have health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service. While it is true that the penalty is linked to income, the nonpartisan federal researchers at CBO and JCT have estimated that around 4 million uninsured Americans, including dependents, will have to pay up in 2016, amounting to $4 billion in revenue per year from 2017 to 2019. This suggests that the mandate does not solely burden the wealthy with taxes, as Rubio claimed.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that Senator Marco Rubio's claim that the ACA adds around $800 billion of taxes on the American people and does not discriminate between rich and poor is false. The law actually generates revenue for the government, provides tax credits to low- and moderate-income families, and does not solely burden the wealthy with taxes.

According to the article, only 85 non-citizens were removed from the voter rolls as of August 1, 2012, which is significantly less than the initial estimate of over 100,000. Additionally, county supervisors of elections reported removing more than 10 non-citizen voters in their respective counties.\n\nThe discrepancy between the initial estimate and the actual number of non-citizen voters removed suggests that the state's effort to remove non-citizen voters may have been incomplete or inaccurate. The article notes that the list of potential non-citizens was based on driver's license data, which can be error-prone and may not reflect the current citizenship status of voters.\n\nTherefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim, as it suggests that there may be inconsistencies or discrepancies in the state's effort to remove non-citizen voters from the rolls."

Additionally, Paul's budget plan proposed a 20 percent cut to the CDC's budget, which amounts to either $1.209 billion or $1.275 billion in cuts. This evidence suggests that Paul did indeed propose a significant cut to the CDC's budget.\n\nFurthermore, Paul's spokesman Brian Darling acknowledged that the senator has proposed cuts to the CDC's budget in the past, but argued that funding and the ability to fight Ebola don't necessarily go hand-in-hand. However, this does not undermine the evidence provided, as it simply highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for careful consideration when allocating funds.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, the label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim that Sen.

However, these trends are not uniform and may indicate a slight up-down pattern rather than a consistent decline in concern.\n\nAdditionally, the article highlights that while few Americans list climate change as a top concern, there is a partisan divide on this issue, with Republicans being less concerned compared to Democrats.

The report found that 66,920 of the numbers had been used by people for whom the government received wage reports from 2006 and 2011, and one of the numbers appeared on 613 different wage reports. Additionally, 3,873 of the numbers turned up in E-Verify inquiries, an Internet-based system that allows employers to determine whether potential hirees are entitled by immigration laws to work in the U.S.\n\nThe evidence provided does not contradict or disprove the claim, and therefore it can be labeled as True."

However, by focusing on the common vehicle fees that most states use, such as vehicle license fees (registration), title fees, and title taxes (sales tax), the article shows that Virginia is already one of the lowest in the region even with the proposed $15 increase.\n\nFurthermore, when comparing just registration fees, the article states that 28 other states have registration fees that are lower than the $56 annual charge proposed for Virginia. This means that Governor McDonnell's statement is incorrect, as Virginia's proposed new fee would not be equal to or lower than most states.\n\nFinally, the article notes that seven states would have higher registration fees than Virginia, but these are not included in the list of states with lower fees provided in the article.

The evidence provided suggests that while Cortez Masto did take legal action against Uber, the reality of the situation is more complicated than the ad suggests.\n\nFirstly, the ad claims that Cortez Masto went after Uber \"three times\" until the company was driven out of the state. However, the evidence provided shows that the Attorney General's office filed three requests for temporary restraining orders in different jurisdictions on the same day Uber launched, creating a legal mess. This suggests that the office was acting quickly and decisively to address the situation, rather than relentlessly pursuing Uber until it left the state.\n\nSecondly, the ad implies that Cortez Masto had a significant amount of discretion in deciding how to handle the Uber situation. However, the evidence provided suggests that the office generally followed the will of its clients, and that it was theoretically possible but highly unusual for Cortez Masto to ignore the will of the state and not file suit.\n\nThirdly, the ad references a $70,000 donation from taxi companies to Cortez Masto, implying that she was influenced by their donations. However, the evidence provided shows that the donations were made between 2005 and 2010, and that Session declined requests from taxi companies who wanted to latch on to the state's lawsuit in order to avoid the appearance of impropriety.\n\nFinally, the ad claims that Uber drivers lost their jobs \"overnight\" due to Cortez Masto's legal fight. However, the evidence provided notes that Uber claimed 1,000 drivers lost their jobs \"overnight,\" but provides no clear way to verify this figure.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that Catherine Cortez Masto drove Uber out of Nevada is overstated and misleading. While Cortez Masto did take legal action against Uber, the reality of the situation is more complicated and nuanced than the ad suggests. Therefore, the label CONFLICTING is appropriate."

    "justification": "The claim that Gen. John Pershing \"took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs' blood,\" and shot 49 Muslim rebels is False. The evidence provided in the article suggests that this story has been debunked by historians and is considered a legend.\n\nThe article cites eight scholars who expressed skepticism that the specific story ever happened, and many added that Trump's takeaway is wrong-headed. The only historical evidence that something like this actually happened appears to come from a letter written by a soldier who served in the Philippines, but this letter was written in 1960, more than half a century after the events in question, and its sourcing is uncertain.\n\nAdditionally, the article notes that the idea that pig's blood could serve as a weapon against Muslims has been around in popular culture for decades, but there is no historical evidence to support this claim. The historians interviewed by the article also pointed out that Pershing pursued a less brutal approach to \"pacifying\" the rebels in the southern Philippines than his predecessor Leonard Wood, and that Trump's larger point is wrong, as the region remained in constant unrest during the period of American rule and into the period of independence.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that Gen. Pershing shot Muslim rebels after dipping bullets in pigs' blood is not supported by historical facts and is considered a legend. Therefore, the label False is appropriate."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, the label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim that \"Over the last few years, more Virginians are moving away from Virginia than are moving to Virginia from the other 49 states.\"\n\nThe evidence supports this claim by providing data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Census Bureau. According to these sources, there has been a net loss of households in Virginia from 2013 to 2018, with an average annual loss of 5,600 families. While the number is relatively small compared to the total number of households in Virginia (approximately 4 million), it suggests that there is indeed a trend of more Virginians moving away from the state than moving in from other states.\n\nMoreover, the evidence attributes the migration losses to economic trends, such as rising costs of living and sequestration programs, rather than direct control by governors. This suggests that the reasons for the outward migration are beyond the control of any one governor, including Glenn Youngkin and Terry McAuliffe.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it is reasonable to conclude that more Virginians are moving away from Virginia than moving in from other states, which supports the label \"True.\""

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it is appropriate to label Senator Booker's claim as \"True\". The evidence shows that between 1990 and 2005, there was an almost identical quote in Bryan Stevenson's book, Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption, published in 2014, stating that between 1990 and 2005, a new prison opened in the United States every 10 days. Additionally, according to a Congressional Research Service report, the number of state and federal adult correctional facilities rose from 1,277 in 1990 to 1,821 in 2005, a 43% increase. This translates to almost exactly one facility every 10 days on average.\n\nFurthermore, while the second part of Booker's claim is less clear, the data gathered by a study in the Harvard Journal on Legislation shows that violent offenders contributed 60% to state prison growth between 1990 and 2009, while nonviolent offenders (drug and property offenses combined) contributed only 27%. This supports Booker's claim that a \"mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders\" occurred between 1990 and 2005.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is accurate to label Senator Booker's claim as \"True\"."

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label the claim \"Under Donald Trump's tax plan, 51 percent of single parents would see their taxes go up\" as True. The evidence from the Tax Policy Center and Forbes supports this conclusion.\n\nFirstly, the analysis by New York University professor Lily Batchelder shows that about 20 percent of households and more than half of single parents would pay more in federal taxes under Trump's plan. This is due to the repeal of personal exemptions and head of household filing status, which disproportionately affect single parents. For example, a single mother with one child can no longer deduct $9,350 in standard deductions and two $4,050 exemptions under Trump's plan, resulting in an additional $2,450 in income taxes.\n\nSecondly, the Tax Foundation's director of federal projects, Kyle Pomerleau, found no faults with Batchelder's report and replicated many of the numbers. This suggests that the analysis is reliable and supports the conclusion that single parents would see an increase in taxes under Trump's plan.\n\nFinally, the Clinton campaign's reference to the Tax Policy Center's analysis provides additional support for the claim. The center's report found that under Trump's plan, a single parent with an income of $75,000 and two school-age children would see their taxes increase by $2,440, while a single parent making $50,000 with three children would face an increase of $1,188.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is reasonable to conclude that 51 percent of single parents would see their taxes go up under Donald Trump's tax plan. Therefore, the label True is appropriate."

Here's why we can confidently label this claim as false:\n\n1. The post claims that the user \"opted out\" of Obamacare after completing the application, but according to CMS spokesperson, it is not possible to complete an application and then opt out at the end. Therefore, this claim is false.\n2. The post states that the user received an email informing them of fines they would face, but PolitiFact points out several errors in this claim. Firstly, the system would not send any user an email if they failed to complete an application. Secondly, any fines would be calculated as part of the user's overall income tax form 1040, and not sent as a bill. Finally, the IRS cannot use any other form of punishment, including suspending driver's licenses or placing federal tax liens on property. Therefore, this claim is false.\n3. The post claims that the fine would be $4,037, but PolitiFact notes that the penalty fee in 2014 is only 1% of income or $95 per person for the year, whichever is higher. Even if we take the user's claimed income of $45-55k annually, they would not have to pay more than $550 by 2015. Therefore, this claim is false.\n4. The post claims that if a person fails to pay their fine, their driver's license will be suspended until paid, and if they fail to pay for 24 consecutive months, the government will place a federal tax lien on their home. PolitiFact confirms that neither of these penalties is possible under the Affordable Care Act. Therefore, this claim is false.\n5. The post suggests that people can give their bank information so that the government can automatically withdraw penalties weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. However, PolitiFact warns citizens not to hand out bank information online and notes that the Treasury Department does not have the authority to use any other form of punishment.

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it can be concluded that Walmart employees represent the largest group of Medicaid and food stamp recipients in many states. The evidence includes data from various studies conducted in different states, which show that Walmart is often the largest employer in these states and has a significant number of employees who receive public assistance. For example, in Florida, Walmart topped all companies operating in the state with the largest number of employees and family members eligible for Medicaid. Similarly, in Ohio, Wal-Mart was the top employer for workers and family members who receive Medicaid, food stamps, and cash assistance. Additionally, the article cites a 2004 study by the University of California Berkeley\u2019s Labor Center, which found that taxpayers paid $86 million a year to subsidize Walmart workers' wages in California.\n\nWhile the article does not provide a specific dollar amount for the cost of Walmart employees on food stamps, it does mention that the Florida taxpayer tab for food stamps for Walmart employees is $2.6 million. Based on this information, it can be estimated that the cost of Walmart employees on food stamps is likely to be significant.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is appropriate to label Walmart employees as the largest group of Medicaid and food stamp recipients in many states."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for Mr. Moshein's claim that the University of Texas can afford to build a medical school because it has a $7 billion endowment and its football program had a $50 million profit last year. The evidence provided in the article supports the idea that UT does have a large endowment and profitable football program, but it also indicates that these funds are not readily available for use in establishing a medical school.\n\nFirstly, the article states that the UT System Board of Regents has committed at least $25 million a year towards the envisioned medical school, plus $5 million annually for eight years to buy equipment. This indicates that a significant portion of the funds needed for the medical school have already been committed.\n\nSecondly, the article notes that UT enjoys around $400 million in combined annual proceeds from the available fund and many endowments established to support specific scholarships, professorships or other projects. While this suggests that there are additional funds available, it also indicates that these funds are committed to existing priorities and cannot be easily redirected towards a new project like a medical school.\n\nFinally, the article quotes UT's chief financial officer, Kevin Hegarty, as stating that if football profits were redirected to a medical school, programs that currently benefit from the profits would be out of luck. This suggests that even if UT had the funds available, it would not be feasible to redirect them towards a new project without causing harm to existing priorities.\n\nBased on these points, it can be argued that while UT does have the means to afford a medical school in terms of its endowment and football program profits, there are constraints on how these funds can be used. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for Mr. Moshein's claim."

He has been talking about the issue since at least February 2014, and his campaign has provided details beyond the price tag.\n\nWhile other candidates have also brought up tuition increases, student debt, and federal spending on higher education, they have not discussed specific plans to address the rising cost of college like Rubio has. Hillary Clinton's tweet omits Rubio's platform plank and exaggerates the fact that no other candidates have discussed this issue.\n\nTherefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate for the claim."

    "justification": "The label \"False\" is appropriate for the claim that a \"legacy of taxing and borrowing crippled the economy we inherited two years ago.\" The evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim. The experts consulted by the author, including professors of economics and analysts from financial firms, agree that problems with taxing and borrowing were not the major causes of Florida's severe recession. Instead, the bursting of the housing bubble and the global financial crisis were the largest factors crippling the economy.\n\nThe article provides several pieces of evidence to support this conclusion:\n\n1. Florida's debt levels increased through 2010 but then declined, which suggests that the state's fiscal position was not significantly eroded during that time.\n2. Real estate values in Florida appreciated by a high rate from 1995 to 2003, but when the bust came, it hit hard, with nearly 14% of Florida home loans in foreclosure by 2010, edging out Nevada for the highest in the nation.\n3. Most economists interviewed by the author believe that the bursting of the housing bubble and the global financial crisis were far and away the largest factors crippling the Florida economy, with state economic policy playing a minimal role.\n4. The combination of the severe national recession, a housing bust, and a financial crisis amounted to a perfect storm for the state, which made it harder to recover from the recession.\n\nBased on these pieces of evidence, it is clear that the claim that a \"legacy of taxing and borrowing crippled the economy we inherited two years ago\" is false. The actual causes of Florida's severe recession were much more complex and involved factors beyond state-level taxing and borrowing. Therefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate for this claim."

    "justification": "The claim that \"North Carolina's replacement for HB2 'orders NC cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020 and unfair \u2018bathroom bans\u2019 remain\" is False. The new law does not order cities to discriminate against LGBT people, nor does it retain the \"unfair \u2018bathroom bans\u2019\" of HB2.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article supports this conclusion. Firstly, the new law revokes the indefinite bans on local ordinances that were included in HB2, which means that cities and counties can now pass their own anti-discrimination ordinances related to employment or public accommodations. This suggests that the new law does not require cities to discriminate against LGBT people.\n\nSecondly, the article notes that the new law makes some concessions to HB2 opponents, such as rolling back a provision that might have prohibited cities and counties from protecting their own employees from anti-LGBT discrimination. This suggests that the new law is not as restrictive as HB2 and allows for greater protections for LGBT people.\n\nFinally, the article states that the new law does not include any provisions that mandate discrimination against LGBT people, and that cities are free to have their own requirements for would-be contractors, including anti-discrimination provisions for LGBT people. This further suggests that the new law does not order cities to discriminate against LGBT people.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim is False and that the new law does not order cities to discriminate against LGBT people until at least 2020."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it is appropriate to label the claim \"Radio Marti and TV Marti have spent more than $500 million to reach less than 1 percent of the Cuban population\" as True.\n\nThe article cites a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report from 2009 that states that over $500 million has been spent on broadcasting to Cuba since the mid-1980s. The GAO report also notes that the best available research shows that the television operation's audience is small, and that there is no real way to get valid audience numbers for Radio Marti. Additionally, a 2010 Senate Foreign Relations Committee report summarizes recent survey results for the radio service, which show that fewer than 2 percent of respondents in 2003, 2005, and 2006 said they listened to Radio Marti during the previous week, and fewer than 1 percent of respondents in 2008 said they listened to Radio Marti during the previous week.\n\nThe article also mentions that Cuban jamming efforts present a consistent challenge to American government broadcasting, which could further limit the reach of these broadcasts. However, the article notes that the U.S. response has been to shift frequencies up to 10 times a day (with an unknown impact on listenership), and to build a digital distribution strategy that uses cell phone text messaging, DVDs, and flash drive technologies. According to the Broadcasting Board of Governors' 2013 annual report, text messages and emails \"reach nearly 1 million Cubans each week.\"\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the claim is supported by the evidence provided in the article. The $500 million spent on broadcasting to Cuba has not resulted in a significant reach of the population, with audience numbers consistently showing low levels of penetration. While the Cuban government's jamming efforts may contribute to this lack of reach, the American response of shifting frequencies and building a digital distribution strategy does not appear to have significantly increased the reach of these broadcasts.

The evidence includes data from Americans for Tax Reform, which supports the Republican tax bill, and statements from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.\n\nFirstly, the evidence shows that at least 4 million workers have received bonuses or other benefits thanks to the new tax law, as reported by Americans for Tax Reform. This number has grown from 3 million workers reported by President Donald Trump at the end of January, suggesting that more workers are benefiting from the tax reform.\n\nSecondly, the U.S. Department of the Treasury predicted that 90% of working Americans would see an increase in take-home pay by the middle of February due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Although we did not hear back from the agency to confirm this prediction, the statement from Secretary Mnuchin suggests that a significant portion of workers will indeed receive higher take-home pay.\n\nWhile some experts have noted that the actual share of workers with more take-home pay may be lower than 90%, the evidence provided supports the claim that many Americans are seeing bigger paychecks as a result of the tax reform. Factors such as higher health insurance premiums could offset some of the increase in take-home pay, but the overall impact of the tax reform on workers' paychecks appears to be positive.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is reasonable to label Rep.

The evidence provided in the article supports the claim that the 1956 Republican Party platform supported equal pay, minimum wage, asylum for refugees, protections for unions, and more.\n\nFirstly, the platform mentioned seven specific items that align with current Democratic talking points, including providing federal assistance to low-income communities, protecting Social Security, extending the minimum wage, improving unemployment benefit system, strengthening labor laws to help workers join a union, and ensuring equal pay for equal work regardless of sex. These are all issues that are generally associated with the Democratic Party today.\n\nSecondly, while the 2012 Republican platform takes a more skeptical view of federal assistance to low-income communities and immigration, the 1956 platform does not express the same level of opposition. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of \"promoting fully the Republican-sponsored Rural Development Program\" and ensuring that \"the government will continue to support and strengthen our farm economy.\"\n\nThirdly, the article notes that many refugees were coming from communist countries in Eastern Europe during the Cold War era, indicating that the 1956 platform's support for providing asylum for thousands of refugees was not particularly controversial at the time.\n\nFinally, the article highlights a difference in approach to labor unions between the two platforms. While the 2012 platform is critical of President Barack Obama's immigration policies and accuses him of granting amnesty to illegal aliens, the 1956 platform takes a more neutral stance on immigration, simply promising to \"create humane procedures to encourage illegal aliens to return home voluntarily.\"\n\nBased on these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the 1956 Republican Party platform supported many of the same issues as the current Democratic Party platform.

However, this data does not include counts of deterred or detained terrorists or suspected terrorists, as noted by Alex Nowrestah, an analyst for the Cato Institute.\n\nLastly, the article provides an alternate claim that supports a seven-a-day calculation, based on a report released by the Justice Department and Homeland Security in 2018. According to the report, Homeland Security \"had 2,554 encounters with individuals on the terrorist watch list (also known as the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Database) traveling to the United States,\" which breaks down to seven individuals a day.

While there has been a decline in waitlists at the state's six \"hubs\" (regional centers where people addicted to opioids can get high-intensity medication-assisted treatment), the evidence does not support the claim that the waiting list in Chittenden County was reduced to zero.\n\nAccording to the article, the state tracks waitlists at the hubs, and there is no data to suggest that the number of people on the waiting list in Chittenden County was reduced to zero during Governor Scott's tenure. In fact, the article states that the last time the state counted a single person on a waitlist at the Howard Center's Chittenden Clinic was in April 2018, when two people were on the waitlist. This suggests that while there may have been some reduction in the waiting list, it is not accurate to say that the number was reduced to zero.\n\nFurthermore, the article notes that the state has had trouble ensuring that professionals can meet the demand for treatment, and that wait times for treatment have persisted for more than five years. This suggests that while progress has been made in reducing waiting lists, there is still work to be done to ensure that all those who need treatment have access to it in a timely manner.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is not accurate to say that the waiting list in Chittenden County was reduced to zero during Governor Scott's tenure.

However, according to the Associated Press story in the Logan Daily News, the new public toilets were constructed to serve the busloads of tourists who come to see the mansion - an estimated 20,000 visitors a year. These renovations were not initiated by Strickland but were set aside in 2006 under the administration of his predecessor, Gov.

    "justification": "The claim that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would help lift over a million Americans out of poverty is True. The supporting article text provides evidence from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that indicates that raising the minimum wage would increase the net income of those living at or below the federal poverty level by $5 billion, which is enough to move nearly a million people above the poverty threshold. While the actual figure may not be exactly \"over\" a million, as Grimes initially claimed, the CBO estimate of 900,000 people being lifted out of poverty is still significant and supports the claim.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article text also highlights that the CBO report estimates that somewhere between a few people and a million people could lose their jobs as a result of a minimum wage hike, which could have a ripple effect on the economy resulting in about 500,000 lost jobs by the end of 2016. However, this does not negate the fact that raising the minimum wage would still lift a significant number of people out of poverty.\n\nFurthermore, the CBO report notes that the large majority of low-wage workers would have higher wages and family income, but a much smaller group would be jobless and have much lower family income. This suggests that while some jobs may be lost due to a minimum wage hike, the overall impact on poverty reduction would still be positive.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the evidence provided in the article text, the label True is justified for the claim that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would help lift over a million Americans out of poverty."

Kevin Brady that Texas families have kept more than $10 billion in their family budgets since the sales tax deduction was restored a decade ago is supported by the evidence provided.\n\nFirstly, the article cites a news story posted online by the Dallas Morning News which states that according to the Texas state comptroller's office, if Congress failed to extend the option of deducting state and local sales taxes, Texans would owe an extra $1.2 billion to the IRS in April 2015. This suggests that the deduction has a significant impact on the amount of federal taxes paid by Texans.\n\nSecondly, the article cites a Pew Charitable Trusts report which states that in 2012, 2.3 million Texas filers (about one in five) used the sales tax deduction with an average deduction of $1,906 for those who claimed it. This suggests that the deduction is widely used by Texans and has a significant impact on their federal taxes.\n\nThirdly, the article cites a statement by Texas tax expert Dick Lavine who notes that the deduction only helps taxpayers who itemize deductions, and that Texans at higher income levels disproportionately enjoy the deduction. This suggests that the deduction has a greater impact on higher-income earners, who are more likely to itemize their deductions.\n\nFinally, the article provides an estimate of the total amount of money saved by Texans over the past decade using the sales tax deduction, based on IRS data. This estimate ranges from $3.2 billion in 2004, the first year the deduction was restored, to nearly $40 billion over the entire decade.\n\nBased on these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim made by Rep. Brady is accurate. The evidence suggests that the sales tax deduction has saved Texans billions of dollars in federal taxes over the past decade, with the exact amount likely to be between $10 and $10.8 billion."

    "claim": "Ed Gillespie\u2019s 2006 book \"promoted an individual health care mandate, and recommends that it be enforced by the IRS through the income tax code.\"",

    "justification": "The claim that Ed Gillespie's 2006 book \"promoted an individual healthcare mandate, and recommends that it be enforced by the IRS through the income tax code\" is true based on the evidence provided in the article.\n\nThe passage in Gillespie's book states that \"a more rational approach is to ensure that every emancipated adult capable of providing for his or her health care do so.\" One way to accomplish this is to use the tax code to gain compliance, where \"annual filers would have to attest that they have some form of health coverage or else the \u2018standard deduction\u2019 on their income tax would be cut in half.\" This language suggests that Gillespie was advocating for a policy in which individuals are required to purchase health insurance in order to receive tax benefits, which is the definition of an individual mandate.\n\nWhile Gillespie's campaign has claimed that he did not support the individual mandate, the evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim. The passage in Gillespie's book discusses various proposals for reforming health care under consideration at the time, but does not explicitly state that he was opposing the individual mandate. In fact, the passage suggests that he was open to the idea of using the tax code to encourage individuals to obtain health insurance.\n\nFurthermore, Gillespie's statements in interviews and op-eds support the conclusion that he did endorse an individual mandate. He specifically weighed in on the Massachusetts plan, stating that he thought the party was probably open to that kind of approach. Additionally, his spokesman acknowledged that Gillespie's mindset at the time was open to an individual mandate, while also stating that he personally thought a different approach was better.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is reasonable to label Ed Gillespie's 2006 book as promoting an individual healthcare mandate and recommending its enforcement through the income tax code."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that HB 97 would prevent the use of taxpayer dollars on abortions is False. The evidence provided suggests that while the federal health care law allows tax dollars to subsidize someone's policy even if the individual chooses a plan that covers abortion, the language in HB 97 does not prohibit the use of taxpayer funds for elective abortions. Instead, it attempts to close a loophole that could allow taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion coverage by requiring policy holders to pay into an abortion fund through their premiums.\n\nThe rhetoric on this issue can be tricky, and the language in HB 97 is similar to provisions inserted into other bills vetoed by Governor Crist. However, the evidence makes it clear that taxpayers will not be paying for elective abortions through HB 97 or any other provision of the federal health care law. Any abortions would be paid through a separate account funded entirely through premiums paid by people who select plans that cover abortion services, not from tax dollars.\n\nWhile some may argue that it is unfair to require individuals to pay into an abortion fund if they do not wish to support abortion services, the federal law requires that every region offer at least one alternative health plan that does not cover abortion. This provides a choice for those with moral objections to paying a portion of their premiums for abortion services.\n\nIn conclusion, based solely on the evidence provided, it is clear that HB 97 will not prevent the use of taxpayer dollars on abortions. Instead, it attempts to close a loophole that could allow taxpayer funds to pay for abortion coverage by requiring policy holders to pay into an abortion fund through their premiums."

It also mentions that the Florida Standards Assessments include reading tests in grades 3 through 11, math tests in grades 3 through 8, and science tests in grades 5 and 8, as well as six end-of-course exams in subjects including math and history. The article also mentions that some school districts give their own district-wide exams that are not required by the state.\n\nThe article does not provide any solid evidence to support the claim that students spend 45 days taking standardized tests. In fact, it suggests that the number of days devoted to testing is lower than what James stated, with the Florida Education Association arguing that the number of days devoted to tests is even higher than what James stated and can reach 60 to 80 days.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that Thomas James' claim that Florida public school students spend \"an array of standardized high stakes tests which eat up as much as 45 school days per year\" is False."

The Republican Party of Florida launched an ad that spoofs the History Channel with a segment called \"This Day in CRIST-ory\" on May 28, 2009, where they show Crist signing a $66.5 billion budget that includes a $1-a-pack cigarette tax and higher fees on drivers licenses and motor vehicle tags. The ad exclaims, \"Two weeks after signing a taxpayer protection pledge, he breaks it!\"\n\nThe evidence shows that Crist signed a taxpayer protection pledge on May 14, 2009, where he promised to oppose any efforts to increase marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses, and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates. However, when Crist signed the budget into law on May 27, 2009, he allowed the $1-a-pack cigarette tax to become law, which violates his older pledge.\n\nWhile Crist's pledge was specific to income taxes and not general taxes, the evidence shows that he signed a second taxpayer protection pledge from Americans for Tax Reform in June 2005, where he promised to oppose and veto any efforts to increase taxes. Therefore, his signature of the budget that included a tax violates his later pledge.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim. Crist signed two different taxpayer protection pledges, one specific to income taxes and another more general, and his actions with regards to the 2009 budget violate both pledges in different ways."

The evidence provided in the article supports this claim by citing multiple instances of Supreme Court justices being confirmed during presidential election years.\n\nThe first instance of a Supreme Court justice being confirmed during an election year was in 1912, when President William Howard Taft nominated Mahlon Pitney and the Senate confirmed him the following month. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis and John Clarke to the high court, and both were confirmed that year. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Cardozo to the court, and the Senate confirmed him within two weeks. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the court; the overwhelmingly Democratic-led Senate approved the choice less than two weeks later.\n\nThe evidence also notes that Anthony Kennedy, the justice specifically cited in the letter, was confirmed in a 97-0 vote in the Democratically controlled Senate on February 3, 1988, which was the final full year of President Ronald Reagan's administration.

    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that the Paris climate deal could cost 2.7 million lost jobs in the U.S. by 2025 is false. The supporting article text provides several reasons why this claim is misleading.\n\nFirstly, the study that was cited to support this claim is based on an extreme model and its results were presented in a misleading way. The NERA researchers acknowledged the risk of their predictions, stating that \"Actual results could be impacted by future events that cannot be predicted or controlled.\" This suggests that the forecast is uncertain and may not accurately reflect reality.\n\nSecondly, the study assumes that regulations will expand beyond the electricity sector, which is where the Obama administration directed it. However, as law professor Cary Coglianese points out, \"The particular model used in that NERA analysis doesn\u2019t match up with what I think most people would recognize as the reality of the economy.\" This suggests that the study's forecast may not accurately reflect how the economy and technology will change in the future.\n\nThirdly, the study ignores the possibility of a changing job market in which jobs in the renewable energy industry replace jobs in the traditional fossil fuel industry that would face heavier regulation to comply with the agreement. As Gary Yohe notes, \"They impose what they interpret as the effect of what the United States agreed to under the Paris accord,\" but \"they pick the least efficient way of doing it.\" This suggests that the study's forecast may overstate the impact of regulations on job loss.\n\nFinally, the article provides evidence from the U.S. Energy and Employment Report designed by the Energy Information Administration, which shows that over 373,000 Americans were employed in solar energy, while the coal industry employed about 160,000 and continued to shrink since 2012 due, in part, to competition by natural gas. This suggests that the job market is changing in a way that may offset any job loss caused by regulations to comply with the Paris agreement.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that the Paris climate deal could cost 2.7 million lost jobs in the U.S. by 2025 is false.

    "justification": "Based on the provided evidence, it can be concluded that the claim made by Governor Rick Scott that adding toll lanes on I-95 in Broward County improved rush-hour traffic for non-toll lanes from 25 mph to 45 mph is true. The evidence suggests that the express lanes created by converting high-occupancy vehicle lanes to express lanes did indeed improve traffic speeds, with southbound traffic in non-toll lanes jumping to an average of 51 mph during morning rush hour and northbound traffic sped up to 41.3 mph in the afternoon rush. These improvements are consistent with Governor Scott's claim that the express lanes benefited all drivers, not just those paying the toll.\n\nThe evidence also highlights the success of the 95 Express project in Miami-Dade County, which added new lanes to a 7.3-mile stretch of I-95 by repainting northbound and southbound lane lines. The express lanes replaced HOV lanes that were reserved for cars carrying two or more people, free of charge. The program has generated about $28 million since its debut and improved peak-period speeds, despite the caveats mentioned in the article regarding the time period and volume of vehicles using the highway.\n\nWhile there may be some debate about whether adding new lanes without tolling would have similarly improved traffic, the evidence suggests that the express lanes did lead to improved traffic speeds for non-toll lanes. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate based on the provided evidence."

    "justification": "The label \"False\" is appropriate for the claim that Democrats pledged to \"force all North Carolinians into a single-payer health insurance scheme\" that would cost $72 billion. The evidence provided in the article does not support this claim.\n\nFirstly, the bill introduced by House Democrats, HB 916, merely directs the legislature to study a single-payer health care system, and does not implement such a system on its own. The bill does not \"force\" anyone into a single-payer plan.\n\nSecondly, the Future Now platform, which the GOP ad references, supports expanding Medicaid in North Carolina but does not endorse any specific legislation. It also does not mention a single-payer health care system.\n\nThirdly, Daniel Squadron, the executive director of Future Now, stated that his group supports universal health care but has not endorsed any specific legislation. He also noted that the GOP is distorting the truth about his group's goals to scare North Carolinians out of voting for Democrats.\n\nLastly, the NC GOP's claim that Democrats have signed a pledge to enact universal health care coverage, which would be a single-payer system, is not supported by the evidence provided. While some Democrats may have signed a pledge to work towards universal health care goals, this does not necessarily mean they support a single-payer system.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that Democrats pledged to \"force all North Carolinians into a single-payer health insurance scheme\" that would cost $72 billion is false."

The article lists 13 speeches for which Bill Clinton received a fee of $500,000 or higher, and notes that only two of these speeches occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state (2001-2012). This information is supported by Hillary Clinton's federal financial disclosure forms, which are available for all the years she held federal positions.\n\nThe article also provides additional context and analysis to support the claim. For example, it notes that Bill Clinton's speaking fees dramatically increased when his wife became a presidential candidate in 2009, suggesting that companies may have been trying to curry favor with her at the State Department. The article also highlights instances in which Clinton received money from groups with pending interests at the State Department, and notes that State Department ethics officials rarely rejected these speaking engagements.\n\nOverall, the evidence provided in the article supports the claim that only two of Bill Clinton's 13 speeches fetching $500,000 or more occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state."

This suggests that the majority of food stamp benefits are paid in the proper amounts to eligible recipients.

However, this does not mean that everyone who makes $100,000 a year will lose $9,000. In fact, the article states that people making between $75,000 and $100,000 deduct $9,949 on average in state and local taxes, which is significantly less than $9,000.\n\nSecondly, even if Higgins had said deduction in his statement, he would still be wrong. The article explains that the deduction for property taxes would be capped at $10,000, and if someone's property tax bill is more than that amount, the difference could not be deducted. This means that the actual savings for people making $100,000 a year would be less than $9,000.\n\nFinally, the article provides a caveat that even if Higgins' claim were true, it would only hold up if there isn't a compromise. This suggests that the actual impact of the bill on residents in New York state could be different from the $9,000 figure cited by Higgins.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that \"The elimination of income and sales taxes in New York is equal to 9 percent of taxable income, meaning that if you make $100,000 a year you lose $9,000\" is false."

This is closer to the range of 1.5 percent to 2 percent claimed by Boxer than the 20 percent to 30 percent cited in some opinion and news articles. Additionally, a study by the Congressional Budget Office found that administrative costs for private insurers were around 11 percent to 12 percent, while Medicare's administrative cost total already includes payments to other agencies for such services, making it more cost-efficient. The article also notes that measuring overhead is worthwhile but has its limitations, suggesting that the claimed range of 1.5 percent to 2 percent may be appropriate.

When the new Republican-held chamber took over, the Obama administration resubmitted Lynch's nomination on January 7, 2015. Therefore, if you count the entire period from November 13 to April 17, when President Obama made his remark, Lynch had waited for 155 days. If you only count the time after the Republicans took over the Senate, the delay was 100 days by the time of Obama's comments and 103 days by the publication date of this article.\n\nWhile it is true that Lynch's nomination has waited longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees, the evidence also shows that the delay for Lynch was unusual compared to historical standards. Only a few nominations in recent decades have waited for longer than 100 days, according to the Senate Historical Office. Moreover, Obama's argument that Presidents are typically given the right to field their own team and Lynch's previous confirmations and stellar credentials make it unclear why her nomination should take so long for a confirmation vote.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it can be justified that Loretta Lynch's nomination has been sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined."

Additionally, Clinton's favorability rating has actually increased slightly since December 2013, when it bottomed out at 49.3%.\n\nCharles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, analyzed polls that have asked Clinton-specific questions at multiple times and found an average decline in those polls of about 8 points in the last 12-20 months. However, when comparing Clinton's performance against specific Republicans mentioned by Priebus, such as Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rand Paul, and Paul Ryan, Clinton continues to do relatively well, beating all four if the election were held today.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be some evidence to support a drop in Hillary Clinton's approval rating, the evidence provided does not conclusively show a significant decline.

The Tax Foundation's analysis of Trump's tax plan shows that the top 1 percent would see their after-tax incomes increase by 10.2 to 19.9 percent, depending on which rate is applied and whether growth is factored in. Additionally, the Tax Policy Center estimated that the top 1 percent would see a 13.5 percent gain in after-tax income. These figures indicate that the wealthy would benefit more significantly from Trump's tax plan than they did under the Bush tax cuts.

Additionally, the article notes that Clinton's campaign has also received donations from lobbyists with ties to the fossil fuel industry, which would not be included in the total amount raised from employees of oil and gas companies.\n\nThe Sanders campaign has argued that this figure underestimates the amount of money raised by Clinton's campaign from the fossil fuel industry, as it does not include donations to a super PAC supporting her campaign or donations to the Clinton Foundation. However, these points do not affect the accuracy of the claim regarding the percentage of money raised from employees of oil and gas companies.\n\nOverall, the evidence provided supports Bernie Sanders' claim that Hillary Clinton has received a relatively small amount of money from employees of oil and gas companies compared to the total amount raised by her campaign. Therefore, I would label this claim as \"True\"."

    "taxonomy_label": "interval",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that President Obama's policies will lead to an unemployment rate of over 9% next year is false. While there are projections from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that suggest an increase in unemployment if current laws are left unchanged, these projections do not attribute this increase directly to President Obama's policies. In fact, the CBO report cited by Bachmann notes that the automatic cuts and tax expirations set to occur if Congress and the president can't reach an agreement on economic stimulus policies would likely lead to a recession, driving down GDP and pushing up unemployment.\n\nBachmann's statement is misleading because it implies that President Obama's policies are the sole cause of any potential increase in unemployment, when in fact it is the failure to reach an agreement on economic stimulus policies that could lead to such an outcome. Additionally, the CBO report does not provide any evidence to support Bachmann's claim that President Obama's policies will lead to a specific unemployment rate next year.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label Bachmann's statement as false."

The landscape historian consulted by the author of the article, Marta McDowell, stated that \"Roses are fussy, they don\u2019t last forever \u2013 plants are living things \u2013 and so sometimes they do need to be replaced.\" Additionally, the Rose Garden Landscape Report lists 58 different roses that have been grown at the White House over the years, including those from previous first ladies. The report also states that there isn't even a definitive rose planting plan for the Kennedy Rose Garden, and records are scarce for plantings in the years after until the Carter administration. This indicates that the roses from previous first ladies were largely gone by the time the Trumps moved in. Therefore, the claim that Melania Trump dug up the White House Rose Garden and removed roses from every First Lady since 1913 is false."

    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim that the Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015 would not \"pause\" the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the United States is accurate. The bill does not bar Syrian refugees from entering the country or impose a religious test, but rather adds layers of certification beyond what's already required to ensure that refugees are safe before entering the United States. According to the evidence provided, the bill requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to conduct its own background checks in addition to the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS), and any refugee would be prohibited from entry until the FBI certifies that they pose no security threat. However, the bill does not institute any penalties or consequences for failure to comply with its requirements, and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI Director James Comey made similar arguments during a news conference after the bill passed, suggesting that the bill would create significant delays and obstacles in the fulfillment of a vital program that satisfies both humanitarian and national security objectives.\n\nHowever, House Democrats who broke ranks with their party to support the bill disagreed with both the president and Republicans, citing that the bill \"doesn't hurt the refugee process\" and that the defectors had \"a sense that the underlying reforms weren't severe.\" Based on this evidence, it appears that the Democrats interpreted the bill as requiring additional certifications but not a complete pause in the resettlement of Syrian refugees.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015 adds additional layers of certification for Syrian refugees, it does not bar them from entering the country or impose a religious test, and therefore cannot be said to \"pause\" their resettlement. The interpretation of the bill's impact on the refugee program is mixed, with some interpreting it as causing significant delays and others seeing it as a relatively minor addition to the existing vetting process."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim that \"Ronald Reagan 'was behind in the polls in 1980 going into the debate with Jimmy Carter and then turned around 10 days later and won 40 states.'\" The evidence provided suggests that while Reagan may have been behind in some polls leading up to the debate, it is not entirely accurate to say he was \"behind in the polls\" going into the debate.\n\nFirstly, the article mentions that some polls had Reagan ahead of Carter, while others had Carter slightly ahead. This suggests that the race was too close to call, with margins of error making it difficult to determine a clear lead. The governor's office did not respond to requests for comment, which further highlights the uncertainty surrounding the race at the time.\n\nSecondly, the article notes that while Reagan ultimately won 40 states in the election, polls failed to capture the scope of his landslide victory. This suggests that the polls may have underestimated Reagan's support, and that his debate performance was a deciding factor in his ultimate victory.\n\nOverall, while there is some evidence to suggest that Reagan may have been ahead in some polls leading up to the debate, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement that he was \"behind in the polls\" going into the debate.

    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that Texas will have more money in its rainy day fund than the other 49 states combined is false. According to the latest information available, Texas's projected reserve balance at the end of the 2015 fiscal year is $8 billion, while the sum total of reserves in California, New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, Florida, and Indiana alone exceeds Texas's projected reserve balance. Furthermore, Alaska has a larger rainy day fund than Texas, with a projected balance of $11.4 billion compared to Texas's $8 billion. Therefore, it is clear that Texas will not have more money in its rainy day fund than the other 49 states combined.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article supports this conclusion. The National Association of State Budget Officers report shows that states have made progress rebuilding budgetary reserves since the Great Recession, but Texas and Alaska are the only two states with significantly higher reserve balances than the other 49 states combined. Additionally, the Pew Charitable Trusts report provides further evidence that Texas's projected reserve balance of $8 billion is not enough to surpass the combined reserves of all other states.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick's statement that Texas will have more money in its rainy day fund than the other 49 states combined is an unintentional error, according to his office. This error highlights the importance of accurate and reliable information when making claims about state finances. In this case, the evidence suggests that Texas's reserve balance will not be significantly higher than the combined reserves of all other states."

The evidence consists of two polls conducted by Gallup and Pew Research Center, which found that a significant majority of Egyptians oppose receiving economic aid from the US.\n\nThe first poll conducted by Gallup found that 82 percent of Egyptians opposed US aid, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. This suggests that the opposition to US aid is widespread and significant. The second poll conducted by Pew Research Center found that 61 percent of Egyptians believed that both US military and economic aid have a harmful effect on Egypt, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points. This suggests that the opposition to US aid is not limited to economic aid but also extends to US military aid.\n\nThe reasons for this opposition are likely rooted in the accusations leveled against non-government, pro-democracy groups from the United States and Europe working in Egypt. The public has become increasingly distrustful of these organizations due to the murky circumstances and arrangements surrounding their prosecution, travel limitations, and sudden departure of US citizens facing trial in Egypt. This has led to a growing sense of suspicion regarding what US funds mean for Egyptian sovereignty.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label the claim as \"True.\" The polls conducted by Gallup and Pew Research Center provide strong evidence that a significant majority of Egyptians oppose receiving foreign aid from the United States.

Lack of direct quotes: The evidence provided does not include any direct quotes from Harvard scientists making this specific claim. While the article mentions that \"spokespeople for Harvard University did not immediately reply to PolitiFact\u2019s emails asking about the post,\" it does not provide any direct quotes or statements from these scientists.\n2. Inconsistencies with other experts: The evidence also highlights estimates from other experts, such as Mark Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard's Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, who has projected that 40% to 70% of the world's adult population could be infected in the coming year. However, these estimates contradict the specific claim made in the Facebook post.\n3. Limited data: As the article mentions, researchers need more data to get a better idea of how far the coronavirus could spread. This suggests that the estimate of 70% infection rate may be overly broad or speculative, and could change as more information becomes available.\n4. Context: The article provides context for the claim by highlighting other estimates from experts and news stories that provide more information on the spread of the virus.

Mike Dudgeon that \"In 38 states, the state school superintendent is appointed by either the governor or the state school board\" is true based on the evidence provided in the article. The Council of Chief State School Officers and the Education Commission of the States, two groups that keep such data, confirm that 37 states have appointed superintendents and 13 states have elected superintendents, including Georgia.\n\nThe article provides background information on the job of state school superintendent in Georgia, which is an elected position with administrative duties mainly running the state Department of Education. The superintendent also carries out policies set by lawmakers, the governor, and members of the state Board of Education appointed by the governor from the state's 14 congressional districts. The article highlights some of the recent superintendents who have made headlines, including Linda Schrenko, who went to prison for stealing federal funds, and Kathy Cox, who proposed striking the word \"evolution\" from the state science curriculum.\n\nRep. Dudgeon's proposed constitutional amendment would require approval of two-thirds of the state House and Senate and could not go before voters until 2016. The amendment aims to change the method for selecting state school board members, though the specifics are still being developed. Dudgeon argues that Georgia's current system, with an elected state superintendent and an appointed state school board, doesn't make sense as the state is electing an administrator and appointing people who make the policy, which is opposite the normal way it works.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that Rep.

    "justification": "The claim made by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce that Tammy Baldwin supports raising taxes by $858 billion is misleading and inaccurate. While it is true that Baldwin voted against an $858 billion bill that extended the Bush-era tax cuts, this does not necessarily mean she supported raising taxes by that amount.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article shows that the $858 billion figure is more complicated than presented in the ad. The bill extended several measures, including a new payroll tax cut, other tax changes, and unemployment benefits. Only a portion of the total cost of the package, estimated at nearly $858 billion over 10 years by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, is reduced revenue from the tax changes. The rest is from additional spending.\n\nFurthermore, the article notes that Baldwin supported extending most of the Bush tax cuts, although taxes would have gone up for families earning $250,000 or more. This suggests that she did not necessarily oppose all tax cuts, but rather opposed the specific bill that was put to a vote.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is misleading to label Tammy Baldwin as supporting raising taxes by $858 billion. While she did vote against an $858 billion bill, this does not necessarily mean she supported raising taxes by that amount. The issue is more complex than the ad suggests, and it is unfair to make such a straightforward claim without providing a more nuanced understanding of the issue.

The evidence provided in the article shows that while the absolute number of people working in Indiana has increased over time, the percentage of the population working has actually decreased slightly.\n\nThe article provides data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that in May 2016, there were 3.07 million people working in Indiana, which is the highest number ever recorded. However, when looked at in terms of percentage of the population, the number of people working has actually decreased slightly over time. According to the Census Bureau's 2015 population estimate, the total population of Indiana was around 6.48 million, which means that 47.3% of the population was working in 2016. This is lower than the percentage of people working in 2000, when 49.7% of the population was employed.\n\nFurthermore, the article provides additional evidence that the increase in employment numbers may not necessarily be a sign of a strong job market. The unemployment rate in Indiana is currently 5%, which is considered good by most economists' standards. However, this rate has been around 5% for much of the time between 1993 and 2008, indicating that the current rate may not be particularly exceptional.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that more people are going to work in Indiana than ever before in history, it is misleading to make this claim without also considering the percentage of the population working.

The ad from President Barack Obama's campaign continues to drumbeat that Mitt Romney is a privileged rich guy who isn't paying his fair share of taxes, but the evidence provided suggests that it's possible that Romney paid a higher effective tax rate than what was mentioned in the ad.\n\nThe first piece of evidence provided is Romney and his wife Ann's 2010 tax return, which showed $3,009,766 in federal income tax paid on $21,661,344 in adjusted gross income - an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent. While this evidence supports the claim that Romney paid less than 14 percent in taxes, it doesn't necessarily mean that he paid less than most Americans.\n\nThe second piece of evidence is a study by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, which shows that many people, particularly at the lower end of the income scale, actually have negative rates because they get back more from the government than they paid in taxes. This suggests that Romney's 14 percent effective tax rate may be lower than what most Americans pay.\n\nHowever, the study also shows that when payroll taxes are included, the combination of employee and employer payroll taxes actually exceeds income tax payments for all but the top one-fifth of earners. This means that Romney's overall tax rate may be higher than what was mentioned in the ad, possibly exceeding 14 percent.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment on whether Mitt Romney paid less than 14 percent in taxes - the claim could be accurate or inaccurate.

The evidence provided in the article refutes this claim in several ways:\n\nFirstly, Hannity's numbers are based on a study by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, which only looks at the insurance rates people can expect to encounter in the online marketplaces, which makes up less than 10 percent of the total private insurance market. The study does not take into account federal government subsidies that will reduce many people's out-of-pocket expenses, at least partially offsetting higher premiums.\n\nSecondly, the study only looks at prices for 27-, 40-, and 64-year-old male and female non-smokers and adjusts prices upward to account for anyone who was denied coverage or had some health problem that would increase their rates. However, this does not take into account the fact that many people will be eligible for subsidies in the form of tax credits, which will reduce their out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nThirdly, the study relies on knowing how much people pay for insurance today, before Obamacare. However, there is no reliable data available on what people pay for insurance today, and the additional services required by the new health care law will increase costs.\n\nLastly, the Congressional Budget Office projects that about half the people buying health insurance through the marketplaces will be eligible for subsidies in the form of tax credits, which will reduce their out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that Hannity's claim is misleading and does not accurately reflect the situation with insurance premiums under Obamacare.

The evidence provided in the article casts doubt on the accuracy of this statement.\n\nFirstly, the studies that have been conducted on this topic have produced conflicting results. While some studies have found a significant increase in the risk of pre-term pregnancy associated with prolonged standing, others have found no link or only a small increase. For example, the 1995 study mentioned in the article found a 20% increase in the risk of premature delivery among women who stood for five hours per day, which is significantly lower than the claimed 80%.\n\nSecondly, the definition of \"prolonged standing\" can vary greatly between studies, which makes it difficult to compare results. This lack of standardization means that the claim of a 80% increase in risk may be based on different criteria than other studies.\n\nThirdly, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has stated that the evidence for a significant increase in the risk of pre-term pregnancy associated with prolonged standing is weak. In fact, ACOG has suggested that the risk may be lower than previously thought, with some studies suggesting a link only at very high levels of standing (e.g., more than 6 hours per day).\n\nFinally, the article quotes Dr. Raul Artal, chairman of the department of obstetrics, gynecology and women's health at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine in Missouri, who states that the worst position for a pregnant woman is standing and being motionless. While moving around can reduce the risk of pre-term pregnancy, there is no evidence to support the claim of an 80% increase in risk associated with prolonged standing.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim of a 80% increase in the risk of pre-term pregnancy associated with prolonged standing is misleading and should be labeled as Conflicting. While some studies have found a small increase in the risk of pre-term pregnancy associated with prolonged standing, the evidence is not conclusive, and the claim should not be taken at face value."

    "justification": "The claim that Hillary Clinton called Barack Obama \"naive\" for saying he would sit down and talk to the Iranians during the 2008 Democratic primary is Conflicting because the evidence provided does not support this claim. The article text presents a different account of Clinton's position on diplomacy with Iran, which contradicts the claim.\n\nFirstly, the article states that Clinton agreed with Obama that she would approach adversaries differently than the Bush administration and get back to diplomacy. This contradicts the claim that Clinton called Obama \"naive\" for his position on talking to Iranians.\n\nSecondly, the article notes that Clinton distinguished herself from Obama by saying she would not necessarily meet with these leaders in her first year without any preconditions, which is what the YouTube question asked specifically. This suggests that Clinton's position was more cautious than Obama's, but it does not support the claim that she called him \"naive\" for his position.\n\nThirdly, the article provides a timeline of events that contradicts the claim. It states that Obama did not personally meet with Iranian leaders in his first year, and it wasn't until 2013 that he spoke over the phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani - the highest-level talks between the two countries in 30 years. This suggests that Obama's position on diplomacy with Iran was more realistic than Clinton's, but it does not support the claim that Clinton called him \"naive\" for his position.\n\nFinally, the article notes that Clinton as secretary of state was personally involved in diplomatic efforts to increase global sanctions on Iran that helped move the nuclear deal forward. This suggests that Clinton was supportive of diplomacy with Iran, but it does not support the claim that she called Obama \"naive\" for his position.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that Hillary Clinton called Barack Obama \"naive\" for saying he would sit down and talk to the Iranians during the 2008 Democratic primary is Conflicting. The article text presents a different account of Clinton's position on diplomacy with Iran, which contradicts the claim. Therefore, the label Conflicting is appropriate."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim that \"When adjusted for inflation, (Texas) per-student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years.\" The evidence provided supports this claim, as it shows that total per-student spending was relatively flat over the past 16 years, ranging from a 2013 inflation-adjusted low of $9,813 per student to a 2009 high of $11,621. The evidence also shows that in 2017, Texas schools are expected to receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003.\n\nHowever, there is a conflicting view presented in the evidence. The Legislative Budget Board analysis indicates that in 2017 dollars, Texas schools will have $10,111 in total per-student aid in 2017--up $33 from $10,078 in per-student spending in 2003. This suggests that per-student spending has increased over the past 16 years, rather than remained relatively flat.\n\nTherefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the evidence presents conflicting views on whether per-student spending has remained relatively flat or increased over time."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, the claim that \"Says that 500,000 federal workers -- one-fourth of the federal workforce -- make more than $100,000 a year\" is supported by the facts. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are nearly 500,000 federal workers who earn $100,000 or more per year. This accounts for about 21-22% of the total civilian workforce in the federal government, which is close to the quarter mark claimed by Mitt Romney.\n\nThe article also notes that some studies have shown that federal workers are not overpaid compared to their private sector counterparts, as their jobs require higher levels of education and skills. This suggests that while there may be some disparity in salaries between federal and private sector employees, it is not significant enough to justify the claim that a quarter of federal workers are overpaid.\n\nOverall, based on the evidence provided, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim."

    "justification": "The claim made by State Rep. Chris Taylor that Wisconsin has seen an expanded prison population and more openings for correctional officers over the past eight years is supported by the evidence provided in the article. According to the May 2019 report from the Legislative Audit Bureau, the prison population grew from 2009 to 2011 (from 22,672 to 21,941), but has grown since then. The report notes that \"the inmate population grew from 21,941 in 2011 to 23,675 in 2018, or by 7.9 percent.\" Additionally, the article states that correctional officer vacancies have increased over the past eight years, with a turnover rate that grew from 17.8% in fiscal year 2013-'14 to 26.1% in fiscal year 2017-'18. The data from the state Department of Corrections shows steady increases in vacant positions over the past eight years, except for a dip in 2017.\n\nThe article also provides an explanation for the increase in turnover and vacancies, citing low unemployment rates and the undesirable nature of the job. Overall, the evidence provided in the article supports Rep. Taylor's claim that Wisconsin has seen an expanded prison population and more openings for correctional officers over the past eight years."

    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The label \"False\" is appropriate for the claim made by Governor Rick Scott in the Florida gubernatorial debate. The evidence provided by PolitiFact Florida indicates that electric rates did not increase by 30% under Charlie Crist's governance, nor did they drop by 11% under Governor Scott's administration. In fact, the base rate went up considerably under Scott, and overall rates are also up since January 2011, despite a significant decrease in fuel reimbursements. The study provided by Edison Electric Institute shows that the average residential bill was not significantly off, and Florida's average monthly bill actually went down during Crist's tenure. Additionally, when Crist entered office in January 2007, the average retail price of electricity for a Florida home was 11.06 cents per kilowatt hour, which is higher than the national average. Therefore, based solely on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that Governor Scott's claim is false."

    "justification": "Based on the provided evidence, it is appropriate to label the claim made by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as \"True\". The evidence from the OECD study shows that the United States spends more per student than any other country, with the exception of Austria, Luxembourg, Norway, and Switzerland. This supports Bush's claim that the United States has an 80% graduation rate in high school after spending more per student than any other country in the world, other than Liechtenstein, I think, or Luxembourg and a couple of other small countries.\n\nThe evidence also shows that the United States spends $12,731 per student on secondary education, which is more than four countries: Austria, Luxembourg, Norway, and Switzerland. Additionally, the federal government's National Center for Education Statistics notes that a country's wealth is positively associated with expenditures per student, with the United States and Chile ranking seventh out of 32 countries in terms of expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product for all levels of education.\n\nWhile there may be some caveats regarding the proportion of educational budget spent on instruction, the evidence provided suggests that the United States spends more per student than any other country, which supports Bush's claim. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate based on the provided evidence."

    "claim": "\"All Aboard Florida is a 100 percent private venture. There is no state money involved.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "Justification: The claim that \"All Aboard Florida is a 100 percent private venture. There is no state money involved\" is misleading. While it is true that All Aboard Florida is a private enterprise, it also takes advantage of infrastructure paid for by the government. Therefore, neither Governor Scott's nor former Governor Crist's statements tell the full story.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article supports this justification. Firstly, the article states that All Aboard Florida will use private financing for a large portion of its costs, but has also applied for a $1.6 billion federal loan. This suggests that there is some level of public funding involved in the project, even if it is not directly provided by the state.\n\nSecondly, the article highlights three points of contention regarding the involvement of state money in the project: the quiet zone funding approved by the legislature for horns at railroad crossings; the possibility of using $44 million in state money to connect All Aboard trains to Tri-Rail; and the use of an intermodal transportation facility at the Orlando International Airport, which will accommodate rail including All Aboard Florida and potentially two other future rail projects. While these points do not necessarily constitute direct state funding, they do demonstrate that the project is connected to government infrastructure and funding in various ways.\n\nFinally, the article quotes a statement from Florida Department of Transportation spokesman Dick Kane, who confirms that no money has been granted yet for quiet zone funding, but notes that local governments have until mid-October to apply for the money. This suggests that while there may not be any state money \"involved\" in the project at present, there is certainly potential for future involvement.\n\nBased on this evidence, it is clear that Governor Scott's claim that All Aboard Florida is a 100 percent private venture with no state money involved is misleading. While it is true that the project is primarily privately funded, there are also connections to government infrastructure and funding that complicate matters. Therefore, we label this claim as Conflicting."

    "claim": "Says U.S. Rep. Connie Mack \"took seven and a half years to finish college.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim that Connie Mack \"took seven and a half years to finish college\" is accurate based on the evidence provided. According to the Palm Beach Post article, Mack attended public high school in northern Virginia before transferring to the Massanutten Military School in Woodstock, Virginia. He then enrolled at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville, Florida, where he spent two and a half years before transferring to the University of Florida in May 1988. Mack graduated from UF in May 1993 with a bachelor's degree in advertising, which means it took him approximately seven and a half years to finish college.\n\nThe evidence provided supports this claim. The Palm Beach Post article details Mack's route to his college degree, including his attendance at public high school, military school, community college, and UF. The article also mentions that Mack took two years off from school to work a full-time sales job before returning to finish his degree through correspondence classes. This information confirms that it took Mack approximately seven and a half years to finish college.\n\nThe label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the evidence provided suggests that Mack took slightly longer than seven and a half years to finish college. According to the UF spokesman, Mack was admitted and registered for classes with the presumption that he would earn the associate's degree during the same semester, which overlaps with the time he was still technically in high school. Additionally, Mack took two years off from school to work full-time before returning to finish his degree through correspondence classes. This means that it actually took Mack approximately seven and a half years to finish college, rather than exactly seven and a half years.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Connie Mack \"took seven and a half years to finish college\" is accurate based on the evidence provided. The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the evidence suggests that Mack took slightly longer than seven and a half years to finish college, due to his overlap with high school and his two-year hiatus from school."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, the claim that \"One in six Texans don\u2019t have healthcare. We\u2019re the most uninsured state in the U.S.\" is true. The New York Times article quotes Lupe Valdez, a former Dallas County sheriff and candidate for governor in Texas, as saying that one in six Texans lack health insurance. This statement is supported by data from the Census Bureau, which estimated that in 2016, Texas had the nation's greatest share of residents without health insurance, with a rate of 16.6 percent. Additionally, other sources such as Gallup and the Kaiser Family Foundation also found that Texas had the highest uninsured rate among all states. While it is true that some uninsured individuals may receive care through alternative means, such as paying out of pocket or going to emergency rooms, the overall trend of high rates of uninsurance in Texas is evident from multiple sources. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim."

While there were no official condemnations from Muslim-majority governments, there was broad rejection of the attacks from officials and top religious leaders. The evidence provided in the article shows that many Islamic religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, and other countries signed a statement condemning the attacks, as did the Organization of the Islamic Conference (now called the Organization of Islamic Cooperation) which represents all Muslim nations in the Middle East and worldwide. Additionally, the article mentions that many average Muslims attended candlelight vigils and other public events to voice sympathy for the victims and repudiate the attacks.

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "Based on the provided evidence, it is appropriate to label the claim as True. The Austin school district's chief financial officer, Nicole Conley, testified that the district pays $406 million in recapture payments to the state, which amounts to 38% of the district's budgeted property taxes. Using this figure and the district's average taxable value of a home ($328,844), it can be calculated that the average homeowner in Austin is expected to pay $1,355 towards recapture.\n\nMultiple experts, including former Texas Education Agency official Joe Wisnoski, agreed that the figure of $1,355 is reasonable and accurate. Additionally, the district spokesman, Jacob Barrett, did not question the math when asked to provide a breakdown of how the average homeowner's share of the recapture payment was calculated.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the claim that the average homeowner in Austin is paying $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture is True."

    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim \"If Florida expanded Medicaid, it would create about 120,000 jobs\" is labelled as Conflicting because the evidence provided does not support this claim. While some studies suggest that expanding Medicaid could lead to job growth, the numbers vary widely and are based on different economic models and assumptions.\n\nThe Florida Hospital Association's analysis, which was cited by Charlie Crist in the debate, predicts about 120,000 jobs would be created through Medicaid expansion. However, other studies have much lower job growth predictions, such as Moody's prediction of 10,000 to 30,000 jobs over 10 years and the White House Council of Economic Advisers' projection of 63,800 jobs between 2014 and 2017.\n\nExperts interviewed by PolitiFact Florida also expressed skepticism about pinpointing a specific number of new jobs from Medicaid expansion, citing the complexity of simultaneously evaluating policy changes and the difficulty of accurately predicting job growth. Harvard professor Katherine Baicker noted that pumping federal dollars into the state would likely be stimulative but difficult to accurately calculate job gains. Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute argued that increasing Medicaid would reduce employment due to people no longer needing to work full-time for health insurance, and University of Chicago economist Casey B. Mulligan previously told PolitiFact that a Medicaid expansion would depress employment nationally.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is uncertain whether expanding Medicaid in Florida would create 120,000 jobs as claimed by Charlie Crist. While some studies suggest job growth could occur, the predictions are conflicting and based on different assumptions. Therefore, the label Conflicting is appropriate for this claim."

    "justification": "The claim \"CBO reports that delaying the Obamacare individual mandate will reduce the deficit by $35 billion over ten years\" is True. The supporting article text provides evidence from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that passing a bill to delay the start of the requirement for individuals to secure health insurance coverage and the tax penalties assessed for not complying with this mandate would save $35.4 billion over 10 years.\n\nThe CBO analysis looked at the potential impact on the federal budget if a bill that has already passed the House were to become law. The bill includes a one-year delay of the start of the requirement and the tax penalties, and it would save $35.4 billion over 10 years, according to the CBO. This figure comes from three areas:\n\n1. Fewer uninsured Americans signing up for government health care programs such as Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, because the mandate wouldn\u2019t be pushing people to do so. Savings: $16.9 billion over 10 years.\n2. Fewer uninsured Americans receiving federal subsidies designed to help them purchase plans on the law\u2019s insurance marketplace. Savings: $8.9 billion over 10 years.\n3. More Americans receiving cash in their paychecks (which is taxable) rather than health insurance (which is not taxable), balanced by the absence of collections of tax penalties for non-compliance. Additional tax revenues, on balance: $7.4 billion over 10 years.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the evidence provided in the article text, which shows that passing a bill to delay the Obamacare individual mandate would save $35.4 billion over 10 years according to the CBO."

    "justification": "The claim that \"Road congestion costs rush-hour drivers in Austin and Dallas more than $1,000 a year\" is appropriate because it is supported by reliable sources. According to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute's Urban Mobility Scorecard, which was cited in the article, the peak congestion cost for Texans in 2014 came out to $17.67 per hour for personal travel. Using this number, we can calculate the yearly delay (61 hours) multiplied by the excess fuel consumption rate (29 gallons at $3.12 per gallon) to get a total congestion cost of $1,490 per commuter. Additionally, City Observatory's Joe Cortright has criticized the Urban Mobility Scorecard for overestimating congestion costs and roadway expansion benefits, but the article notes that the scorecard focused on \"numbers that seem relevant,\" and that most people are concerned with what their daily commute costs them.\nFurthermore, the article cites Todd Litman with the Victoria Transport Policy Institute, who criticizes the Urban Mobility Report for overestimating congestion costs and roadway expansion benefits, but the article notes that Litman's criticism does not affect the group's method of gathering data.\nBased on these sources, it is reasonable to conclude that road congestion in Austin and Dallas does indeed cost drivers more than $1,000 per year."

This lack of a credible source undermines the validity of the claim.\n\nSecondly, the Agriculture Department does have pre-World War II material on hemp, but there is no reference to a prediction that all paper would come from hemp by the 1940s. The best known of these documents is Bulletin 404, which features two studies published in 1916 that investigate the plausibility of using hemp hurds to make paper. However, the article states that Bulletin 404 does not make this claim.\n\nThirdly, the article consulted with ten other experts who had never heard of this claim or seen it persuasively documented. This suggests that the claim is unlikely to be based on any credible evidence.\n\nFinally, the author of the article expresses skepticism that the claim exists somewhere in the department's archives and notes that even if such a claim existed, it would not be surprising given the abundance of trees available at the time.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim that \"In 1916, the U.S. government predicted that by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down\" is false."

These steps include the liberation of all political prisoners and some basic steps toward freedom, including freedom of the press, political parties, labor unions, etc.\n\nThe article highlights several instances where Obama reiterated his campaign position during his 2008 presidential race, including a speech he gave in Miami in May 2008, where he emphasized the importance of \"libertad\" (Spanish for freedom) and called for a new strategy on Cuba. He also stated that he would maintain the embargo as leverage to present the regime with a clear choice: if they take significant steps toward democracy, beginning with the freeing of all political prisoners, the United States will take steps to begin normalizing relations.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article does not suggest that Obama's position on normalizing relations with Cuba has changed since his 2008 campaign.

Additionally, the Mayo Clinic recommends using antiviral drugs like Tamiflu if you have severe infection or are at higher risk for complications. Therefore, I would label this claim as Conflicting Evidence.\n\nThe evidence provided suggests that Sambucol may offer some benefits in terms of anti-inflammatory properties and nasal congestion relief, but the studies performed were small and inconclusive. The study from Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry found that elderberries contain tannins and viburnic acid, which have been shown to help with nasal congestion and to improve respiration, but it does not directly prove the effectiveness of Sambucol in treating flu symptoms. The study from Norway found that patients treated with Sambucol had symptom relief on average four days earlier than the placebo group, but the study was small (80 patients) and the findings were not verified by larger, more conclusive studies.\n\nSimilarly, while Oscillococcinum has been marketed as a homeopathic remedy with potential benefits for treating flu symptoms, the evidence provided suggests that the effectiveness of this supplement is unproven and may be biased by the company itself. The Cochrane review found that Oscillococcinum did not prevent the flu in preventative trials, and that the trials that suggested it helped with flu symptoms were biased.

However, this statement is refuted by an August 27, 2010, letter from John O. Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, which was sent on White House letterhead. The letter acknowledges Perry's concerns and appreciates his outreach, but does not embrace any of Perry's requests. Instead, it notes that President Obama has made securing the border a priority and highlights the Southwest Border Security Act, which was signed into law shortly after Perry's visit to Austin. The letter also mentions additional National Guard troops and other security resources that would be deployed to enhance security on the southern border. Taken together, these pieces of evidence suggest that Governor Perry did receive a response from President Obama, albeit not one that fully addressed his requests."

    "claim": "Says President Dwight Eisenhower \"moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim that President Dwight Eisenhower \"moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country\" is Conflicting because the evidence provided challenges this claim. While it is true that Eisenhower oversaw a campaign in the 1950s known as \"Operation Wetback,\" which did result in the deportation of undocumented immigrants, the number of people deported is not as clear-cut as Trump suggests.\n\nFirstly, the estimate of 1.5 million deportations during Operation Wetback is based on a statement from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which has been disputed by historians. Don Mitchell, a geography professor at Syracuse University, notes that the INS claimed as many as 1.3 million people were deported, but the number officially apprehended did not come anywhere near this total. Similarly, Kelly Lytle Hernandez, a history professor at the University of California Los Angeles, puts the maximum number of people actually deported during the operation at 250,000.\n\nSecondly, the evidence suggests that many of the deportees were able to re-enter the United States illegally or legally as guest workers. According to historian Mae M. Ngai, transportation conditions for the deportees were inhumane in some cases, leading to the deaths of 88 people in a July deportation round-up. However, attempts to relocate people to the Mexican interior did not always stop them from returning, with many returning illegally or legally as guest workers.\n\nFinally, the operation was more about policy changes that allowed more opportunities for immigrants to gain legal status through work visas than it was about deportation. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, notes that low levels of undocumented immigration in the 1950s were more likely a result of the guest worker program, rather than the 1954 deportation campaign.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that Trump's claim about Eisenhower deporting 1.5 million illegal immigrants is an exaggeration and a twist on the facts. While there were certainly deportations of undocumented immigrants during Operation Wetback, the actual number is much lower than what Trump suggests, and many of those deported were able to re-enter the United States illegally or legally as guest workers. Therefore, the label Conflicting is appropriate for this claim."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim made by the American Crossroads ad attacking Bill Nelson is misleading. The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the ad misrepresents the facts regarding Nelson's vote on the Affordable Care Act and the impact of the law on Medicare spending.\n\nFirstly, the ad falsely claims that Nelson cast the deciding vote for Obamacare cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion and letting an unelected board decide what gets covered. However, as PolitiFact has repeatedly ruled, the healthcare law does not literally cut a dollar amount from the Medicare program's budget. Instead, it instituted changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the healthcare law reduced Medicare outlays by $716 billion over the 2013-2022 period, but this does not represent a cut in spending but rather an attempt to curtail future Medicare spending.\n\nSecondly, the ad claims that an unelected board will decide what gets covered here, implying that the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) will ration care and deny treatments to patients. However, as PolitiFact has explained, the IPAB is directed by law to identify Medicare savings, but it cannot submit recommendations to ration healthcare or raise revenue. The board only makes recommendations if Medicare exceeds its budget targets, and its decisions are subject to congressional override.\n\nIn conclusion, the American Crossroads ad misleads viewers by falsely claiming that Bill Nelson cast the deciding vote for Obamacare cutting Medicare spending by $700 billion and letting an unelected board decide what gets covered. The ad also distorts the fact that the healthcare law does not literally cut Medicare spending, but rather attempts to curtail future spending, and that the IPAB does not have the power to ration care or raise revenue. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "Based solely on the evidence provided in the article, it is appropriate to label Ben Carson's tax plan as \"False\". The article provides several reasons why Carson's tax plan would not generate enough revenue to cover government spending:\n\n1. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the United States is expected to collect $3.2 trillion in revenue in 2015, while government spending will reach $3.7 trillion. Carson's plan falls $0.6 trillion short of anticipated revenue and $1.1 trillion short of spending.\n2. The article notes that Carson's tax rate of 15% would generate about $2.6 trillion in revenue, which is still $0.6 trillion short of the expected revenue.\n3. Carson has proposed eliminating both the payroll tax ($1.1 trillion in 2015) and the estate tax ($20 billion), which alone puts him in a hole of $1.3 trillion.\n4. Even if we assume that Carson can tax all of GDP, his 15% tax rate still falls short of anticipated revenue and spending. As the article states, \"taxing all of GDP by 15 percent would still create a $1 trillion hole this year.\"\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that Carson's tax plan would not generate enough revenue to cover government spending, making his claim that his tax plan wouldn't leave the federal government with a $1.1 trillion hole \"False\"."

    "justification": "The claim that Fox News broke the story of George W. Bush's drunk driving arrest in 2000 is correct. The evidence provided in the article supports this claim.\n\nFirstly, the article states that the first news organization to run the story was Fox News, who carried an item at 6 p.m. on the day the story broke. This indicates that Fox News was the first to report on the arrest, and therefore broke the story.\n\nSecondly, the article explains that the local Portland Fox affiliate, WPXT, was responsible for uncovering the story. A reporter at the station, Erin Fehlau, found the case number and began following the paper trail, which led to the Bush campaign confirming the arrest. However, the article notes that Fox News did not have a hand in doing the digging that brought this story to light, as WPXT was an independent news operation at the time.\n\nFinally, the article highlights the recognition Fehlau received for her work on the story, including the National Clarion Award and the regional Edward R. Murrow Award for investigative journalism. This suggests that the story was widely reported and recognized as a significant news event, further supporting the claim that Fox News broke it.\n\nBased on these points, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim, as there is evidence to support both the claim that Fox News broke the story and the claim that other sources may have also reported on the arrest."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it can be concluded that the claim \"Says since Australia passed tough gun laws, 'homicides by firearm have declined almost 60 percent'\" is True. The article provides several sources to support this claim:\n\n1. Philip Alpers, a public health professor at the University of Sydney, found that the number of gun homicides fell from 69 in 1996 (excluding the 35 victims of the mass shooting prompting the laws) to 30 in 2012, representing a decrease of 56.5 percent.\n2. Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University found through a reputable peer-reviewed study in the American Law and Economics Review that firearm homicides dropped 59 percent in the decade after the gun laws.\n3. Don Weatherburn, director of the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, stated that while gun homicide was coming down before any of this, there is some evidence that tougher gun laws reduced the homicide rate, but it is \"far from conclusive.\"\n4. Simon Chapman, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney, co-authored a 2006 study showing faster falls in firearm deaths after the laws.\n\nThe evidence provided suggests that there has been a significant decline in homicides by firearm in Australia since the implementation of tough gun laws. While it is important to note that the science is not yet definitive, the available data supports the claim that homicides by firearm have declined almost 60 percent since Australia passed tough gun laws. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate."

While it is true that during his presidency, the United States saw a net increase of nearly 5 million private-sector jobs, as evidenced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics seasonally adjusted data from February 2010 to October 2012, this figure does not account for public-sector job losses. When factoring in these losses, the net increase in total jobs is significantly lower, at around 4.5 million. Additionally, starting at different points during Obama's first year in office provides a less optimistic outlook on job growth. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim."

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The claim that \"if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent\" is true based on the evidence provided. The article explains that the standard measure of unemployment, known as U-3, only captures a portion of the total number of people who are underemployed or out of work. Specifically, it only includes those who are actively seeking work and have been looking for a job in the past 12 months.\n\nHowever, there are many others who want to work but have given up looking for employment, or who are working part-time despite preferring full-time work. These individuals are not included in the U-3 measure of unemployment. To get a more accurate picture of the total number of people who are struggling for work, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) offers an alternative measure known as U-6. This measure includes three additional groups: marginally attached workers, who want to work but have not searched for a job in the past 12 months; working part-time for economic reasons, who would rather be working full-time but cannot find a full-time job; and discouraged workers, who have stopped looking for work due to lack of opportunities.\n\nUsing this broader measure of unemployment, the article states that the U-6 rate was 15.1% in January 2012, which is significantly higher than the standard U-3 rate of 8.3%. This suggests that there are many more people who are struggling for work than the standard measure indicates.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the claim \"if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent\" is true. The standard measure of unemployment only captures a portion of the total number of underemployed or out-of-work individuals, and a broader measure such as U-6 provides a more accurate picture of the total number of people who are struggling for work."

The evidence provided in the article shows that Trump has consistently qualified his statement, adding caveats such as \"perhaps,\" \"because he was captured,\" or \"perhaps he's a war hero.\" This implies that captivity is not necessarily a marker of heroism, which undermines the validity of McCain's status as a war hero.\n\nMoreover, Trump's accusation that his critics are cherry-picking his comments is unfounded, as he is the one taking his own words out of context by qualifying them with ambiguous phrases. The experts quoted in the article agree that Trump's self-defense is flimsy and that he is guilty of the same behavior he accuses others of.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for Donald Trump's statement about John McCain being a hero.

The article from The Washington Post provides preliminary state gross domestic product figures for 2014, which show that Virginia's GDP of about $427 billion last year was indeed flat with zero percent inflation-adjusted growth from 2013. Only two states trailed the Old Dominion in growth: Mississippi and Alaska, which saw their state economies shrink. Additionally, economic experts highlighted that Virginia's low numbers largely reflect a slow recovery from the Great Recession, exacerbated by its dependence on federal spending in an era of budget cuts. These factors suggest that the claim is accurate based on the provided evidence."

The label \"Conflicting\" accurately reflects the findings of the article, which present evidence to challenge Malkin's claim.\n\nThe article provides several points to support this conclusion:\n\n1. North Carolina didn't have a Republican governor until over a decade after 9/11. Therefore, it was not possible for McCrory to have taken any action related to driver's licenses for illegal aliens during his term.\n2. North Carolina is not among the 14 states and territories that allow immigrants living in the country illegally to get a driver\u2019s license. In fact, there is currently a bill in the General Assembly to do this, but it hasn't passed.\n3. During McCrory's term, DACA recipients became eligible for driver\u2019s licenses. However, McCrory himself opposed expanding driver\u2019s license eligibility to immigrants living here illegally.\n4. The REAL ID Act of 2005 mandated states to require proof of citizenship for REAL ID driver\u2019s licenses and identification cards, which prevented immigrants living in the U.S. illegally from getting licenses.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that Malkin's claim is incorrect and that McCrory did not \"shepherd in\" driver's licenses for illegal aliens in the aftermath of 9/11.

    "justification": "The claim that Charlie Crist allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year is True. The evidence provided in the article supports this claim. In 2007, when Crist took office, the state Legislature set undergraduate rates with no cap on how much the price could go up. Later that year, the Legislature let the largest state research universities raise rates up to 15 percent per year. Crist opposed raising tuition in 2007, but he later reversed himself and the 5 percent hike took effect. The Legislature approved a new plan in 2009 that allowed the Board of Governors to raise undergraduate tuition rates past whatever the Legislature approved, as long as the total increase didn\u2019t exceed 15 percent per year. Crist advocated for this plan and signed it off when the Legislature approved it.\n\nThe article explains how the process worked: both the Legislature and the Board of Governors had a role in raising tuition. The Legislature set its base tuition increase each year, and individual universities could ask the Board of Governors for another increase called tuition differential. The total increase couldn\u2019t add up to more than 15 percent. The governor could veto the Legislature's increase but not the Board of Governors' increase.\n\nUnder Crist's administration, the legislative increase was 5 percent in 2007, and the board of governors increased tuition by 7 percent, resulting in a total increase of 12 percent. In 2008, the legislative increase was 6 percent, and the board of governors increased tuition by 9 percent, resulting in a total increase of 15 percent. In 2009, the legislative increase was 8 percent, and the board of governors increased tuition by 7 percent, resulting in a total increase of 15 percent.\n\nDuring Scott's administration, the legislative increase was 8 percent in 2010, 7 percent in 2011, and 3 percent (vetoed) in 2013. The article notes that Scott definitely used his veto power to stop the Legislature in 2013, but it was his influence on the Board of Governors that kept last year's hike so low.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that Crist allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year during his administration. The article provides specific examples of how this played out under his administration, including the legislative and board of governors increases in each year. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim."

The Interim Committee on Binational Health Benefit Plan Coverage later conducted a study that outlined cost savings generated by binational insurance plans in Texas, as well as legal and practical impediments to implementing them. While Perry's campaign did not respond to questions about his stance on binational health insurance, the evidence suggests that he was at least open to the idea of exploring it further.

The article cites data from the Census Bureau that supports this claim. In 2012, among Americans aged 18 to 64 who worked full-time, year-round, the poverty rate was only 2.9 percent. This suggests that having a job significantly reduces the likelihood of being in poverty.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this figure may not accurately reflect the entire population of workers, as the article points out that there are people who have jobs but not full-time, full-year jobs. Among those with part-time jobs, the poverty rate is 16.6 percent, and among all workers (those with either full- or part-time jobs), the poverty rate is 7.3 percent. These figures suggest that while having a job greatly reduces the likelihood of poverty, it does not eliminate it entirely.\n\nThe article also highlights an additional point, which is that even among those who work full-time, year-round, there are still many who end up below the poverty line. Nearly 2.9 million people worked full-time for the whole year yet still ended up below the poverty line, according to the census figures.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim that \"If you have a job in this country, (there's a) 97 percent chance that you're not going to be in poverty\" is supported by the data provided, it is important to recognize that there are still many people who work hard but struggle to make ends meet.

The supporting article text provides evidence for this claim through several lines of argument:\n\nFirstly, the article mentions that the National Catholic Welfare Council, the predecessor of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, held an annual meeting in which U.S. bishops discussed national policy issues such as education, welfare, and healthcare. During the February 1919 meeting, a group of bishops led by Father John A. Ryan published the Bishops\u2019 Program of Social Reconstruction, which included a section on social insurance that advocated for comprehensive provision for insurance against illness, invalidity, unemployment, and old age. This document represents a clear statement of support for universal healthcare from the Catholic Church.\n\nSecondly, the article notes that the USCCB has consistently supported healthcare expansions over the years, including former President Bill Clinton\u2019s ultimately defeated healthcare plan in 1993. This suggests that while the bishops may have specific reservations about certain aspects of healthcare policy, they remain committed to the broader goal of ensuring access to comprehensive and universal healthcare.\n\nFinally, the article quotes Cardinal Timothy Dolan as saying that the bishops are \u201cfor universal, comprehensive, life-affirming health care.\u201d This statement further reinforces the conclusion that the bishops support universal and comprehensive healthcare.\n\nBased on these lines of evidence, it is clear that the claim that the bishops of the United States came out in 1919 for more affordable, comprehensive, and universal healthcare is supported by the provided evidence.

The Social Security Administration estimated that in 2009, 3.1 million unauthorized workers paid into Social Security via payroll tax, and the Tax Policy Center estimates that 56 percent of the entire population pays federal income tax, while 44 percent don\u2019t. These figures suggest that a substantial number of undocumented workers are indeed paying federal income taxes.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no official count of undocumented workers who pay federal income taxes, and it is unknown how much Trump pays in federal income taxes due to his refusal to release his tax returns. While experts can make educated guesses about how many undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, there is still too much that is not known about Trump's tax returns to accurately compare their tax burden.\n\nIn conclusion, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because while there is evidence to suggest that a significant number of undocumented workers do pay federal income taxes, there is also uncertainty surrounding Trump's own tax burden. Without more information, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about who pays more in federal income taxes between Trump and undocumented workers."

In fact, the data shows that while Florida lost 10,600 total government jobs from December 2011 to December 2012, it also saw an increase of 65,600 private-sector jobs during the same period. This means that the overall nonfarm jobs total for Florida in 2012 was a net gain of 54,900 jobs.\n\nThe claim made by the Democrats that Scott cut more jobs than he created is therefore not supported by the evidence. While it is true that the state experienced negative job growth during certain periods in 2012, this was not solely due to actions taken by Governor Scott. Economic experts have pointed out that governors usually have little influence on short-term economic performance in their states, and that national trends and general economic circumstances overwhelm the actions of a single governor.\n\nFurthermore, the article notes that Governor Scott made no secret of his desire to shrink the state payroll during his campaign, and that he did in fact cut state jobs by 5 percent, which is reflected in the label \"Promise Kept\" on the Scott-O-Meter. However, the evidence provided does not support the claim that he cut more government jobs than were created in the private sector in 2012.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it can be justly labeled that Governor Rick Scott did not cut more government jobs than were created in the private sector in Florida in 2012."

The Assemblywoman Caroline Casagrande is quoted as saying that every American owes the federal government $51,777.21, which is calculated by dividing the national debt of $16,295,297,196,000 by the total population of 314,719,484.\n\nThe evidence provided supports this claim as it cites a website that lists the national debt and provides explanations from federal budget experts. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, explains that what the nation owes each year on the national debt is annual interest and principal payments, and that taxpayers do not face the possibility of receiving a large bill in the mail anytime soon. Additionally, our PolitiFact colleagues in Virginia and New Hampshire have found similar claims to be accurate, with one rating it as True and the other as Mostly True.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label the claim \"Every American now is $51,000 in debt\" as True."

    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim that \"Existing law right now requires 700 miles of double-layered border fencing\" on the Mexico border is False. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 did require the construction of a double-layered fence along at least 700 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, but this requirement was later amended in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 to now mandate only \"reinforced fencing\" without specifying the height or material of the barrier. Therefore, the current law does not require double-layered fencing.\n\nThe article cites a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report that states they have fencing on 650 miles of the border, with only 36 miles covered by double-layered fencing. This indicates that the majority of the border is not equipped with double-layered fencing as claimed in the original statement. Additionally, the article quotes a DHS official who states that they believe they have enough fencing to meet their needs and that any additional fencing would not contribute to border security.\n\nBased on these facts, it is clear that the claim about existing law requiring 700 miles of double-layered border fencing is false. The law has been amended to no longer require double-layered fencing, and the current fencing infrastructure does not meet this standard."

    "taxonomy_label": "interval",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim because the evidence provided does not support the claim that the Department of Homeland Security did not request any flight hours for aerial surveillance from the Department of Defense in 2017.\n\nThe letter from R. Gil Kerlikowske, then the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, to Brian McKeon, who was a Department of Defense undersecretary, indicates that Congress has consistently appropriated DoD funds to assist CBP in securing the Southwest border. Additionally, Kerlikowske prioritized the allocation of those funds for rotary-wing assets (helicopters) to provide tangible benefits to border security. This suggests that DoD was willing and able to provide support to CBP in 2017.\n\nFurthermore, when asked for factual backup of the claim, Cuellar's press secretary provided contact information for a director with the Texas National Guard, who could verify that Operation Phalanx is a federal mission under CBP's direct control. This undermines Cuellar's initial claim that no flight hours were requested from the National Guard.\n\nFinally, the letter from Kerlikowske indicates that CBP welcomes the opportunity to maintain DoD aviation and associated support capabilities should funding be made available. This suggests that CBP values its relationship with DoD and wishes to continue its efforts to maximize the impact of any appropriations or other DoD activities along the Southwest border.\n\nIn light of this evidence, it is unclear why Cuellar claimed that no flight hours were requested from the National Guard in 2017. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it can be argued that Beto O'Rourke's claim of being one of two members of Congress who takes no corporate cash and no political action committee money is generally accurate. The article provides information from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and OpenSecrets, a website run by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, to support O'Rourke's claim.\n\nThe evidence shows that O'Rourke has not accepted any PAC contributions in his campaigns since 2011, including in his 2016 re-election bid and his 2018 Senate campaign. The article also notes that O'Rourke's campaign received $110,721 in PAC contributions in 2015-16, but these were almost uniformly made by individuals whose personal contributions were routed through supportive \"conduit\" PACs.\n\nFurthermore, the article provides information from ActBlue, a large aggregator of individual contributions among the PACs linked to O'Rourke, which says it offers tools to help Democratic candidates but is not a traditional PAC that rounds up donations and obscures specific donors. This suggests that O'Rourke's claim of taking no PAC money is accurate, as he has not accepted any direct corporate or union donations, but rather relies on individual donations processed through intermediary groups like ActBlue.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that O'Rourke's claim of being one of two members of Congress who takes no corporate cash and no political action committee money is generally accurate, although there may be some confusion or inconsistency in the FEC filings and OpenSecrets data."

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The claim that 70 percent of benefits in Donald Trump's proposal for child care go to people making over $100,000 a year is true based on the evidence provided. The Tax Policy Center study found that Trump's plan relies on tax deductions, which are worth more per dollar for higher income families due to their higher marginal tax rates. This means that lower-income families may spend less on child care and receive less benefit from Trump's proposed tax credits.\n\nAccording to the study, families making between $100,000-$200,000 per year would see an average jump of $360 in after-tax income due to Trump's plan. In contrast, families with an income below $40,000 per year might see an increase of $20 or less. These findings suggest that the majority of benefits from Trump's proposal do go to higher income brackets.\n\nAdditionally, the report notes that lower-income families are less likely to place money into Trump's proposed savings accounts due to lower levels of financial liquidity. This further supports the conclusion that the benefits of Trump's proposal disproportionately benefit higher income brackets.\n\nWhile it is possible that future versions of Trump's policy may have a different distributional impact, based on the evidence provided, it appears that his current proposal does indeed favor higher income families more than lower-income ones. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, the claim that \"Collectively states are spending more on Medicaid than they do on K-12 education\" is true. The report from the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) found that states planned to spend a total of $1.7 trillion in fiscal 2012, with $406 billion going towards Medicaid, which accounts for 23.9% of their total budgets. In comparison, elementary and secondary education received $336 billion, or 19.8% of total expenses.\n\nThe article also highlights that the federal government provides states with about 56% of what they spend on Medicaid, which means that the portion of general funds spent on Medicaid is lower than the total amount spent. Therefore, when including both methods of accounting (total funds and general funds), public schools rise to the top of the expense list, drawing an expected $235 billion last fiscal year, or 34.7% of all general fund spending. Medicaid falls to a distant second, receiving an estimated $133 billion, or 19.6% of general fund outlays.\n\nExperts consulted by the article also confirmed that both methods are used in the report and that including federal dollars is important because states still administer it, even though it's not entirely their money. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, the claim that \"Collectively states are spending more on Medicaid than they do on K-12 education\" is supported by the data."

The evidence suggests that Anthem, the predominant insurance company in New Hampshire, allowed policyholders to renew their existing policies early, thereby keeping their current doctors and hospitals.\n\nThe NRCC ad that Rep. Carol Shea-Porter was responding to claimed that one-third of the state's hospitals weren't covered under the Affordable Care Act, which is true in a sense since Anthem's individual plans for sale on the state's new insurance marketplace offer a \"narrow network\" that excludes 10 of the state's 26 hospitals. However, Anthem confirmed that those who renewed their existing plans before the deadline would have access to the same network of providers, including those 10 hospitals, for 12 more months.\n\nFurthermore, the statement from Rep. Shea-Porter indicates that she had worked with Anthem representatives to extend the company's renewal deadline for individual policyholders, allowing them to keep their current doctors and hospitals. This extension suggests that Anthem was willing to allow policyholders to retain their existing coverage, despite the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it can be justified that the claim \"Granite Staters who hold individual policies from Anthem...can indeed renew their policies and keep their current doctors and hospitals\" in 2014 is true.

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, the label \"True\" is an appropriate label for the claim made by David Cicilline. Here's why:\n\n1. The article states that during Cicilline's administration, the city made its annual required contribution (ARC) every year, with one exception (p. 2). This suggests that the city was consistently contributing to the pension fund at a level of 100%, with only a brief period where the contribution fell below this threshold.\n2. The article also states that during Cicilline's tenure as mayor, the city made its ARC at a rate of 100% or higher for most years (p. 3). While there was a brief period where the contribution fell below 100%, the city generally met or exceeded this threshold throughout Cicilline's administration.\n3. The article notes that during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, the city's pension contribution was only 96% (p. 4). However, this is an exception to the general trend of the city making its ARC at 100% or higher.\n4. The article concludes that during Cicilline's administration, the city's pension contributions were made at 100% or within just a few percentage points for most years (p. 5). This suggests that the claim \"we were at 100 percent\" is supported by the evidence.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that Cicilline's claim about the city's pension contributions during his administration is accurate. The evidence supports the label \"True\"."

This designation is concerning because it suggests that CAIR may be viewed as a threat to national security or public safety, which could have negative consequences for the organization and its members.\n\nHowever, the article also provides evidence that CAIR does not have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, a group that has been oppressed in Egypt and other countries. This suggests that the UAE's designation of CAIR may be based on political motives rather than any actual links to terrorism.\n\nFurthermore, the article notes that many groups listed by the UAE have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, which raises questions about the validity of the list and the criteria used to designate organizations as terrorist groups. This suggests that the label \"terrorist organization\" may be applied unfairly or arbitrarily, which could lead to misconceptions about the nature and activities of CAIR.\n\nIn conclusion, while the UAE's designation of CAIR as a terrorist group is concerning, there are also reasons to doubt the validity of this label based on the evidence provided in the article.

The article also notes that Mack's time at the home has been questioned by political opponents and his ex-wife, who claimed that he bought the condo to aid his political career. The property appraiser for Lee County confirmed that Mack is entitled to the homestead exemption if he can prove his finances are not co-mingled with those of his wife, which he has done.

The evidence provided in the article supports this conclusion.\n\nFirstly, the anti-stadium group's calculation of $1 billion plus in property taxes owed by Precourt if it owned the land instead of leasing it from the city is based on a flawed assumption. As Professor Peinhardt notes, forecasting accurately over an 80-year period is impossible, and there are many factors that could impact the value of the facility and the tax calculation.\n\nSecondly, the group's analysis assumes no benefits to the city from the stadium, such as jobs, tourism, or nearby development, which should be considered when evaluating the cost to taxpayers. As Professor Jensen notes, while the current plan might not be the most revenue-maximizing path for the city, the potential positives should be taken into account.\n\nFinally, the article states that under the proposed lease agreement, the city would still own the stadium outright if the team's ownership didn't renew the deal, which negates the claim of a \"giveaway.\"\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the anti-stadium group's calculation is overly simplistic and does not accurately reflect the situation. Therefore, the label False is appropriate."

This means that nearly 1 in 5 Texans under the age of 65 did not have access to health care coverage before the pandemic.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the unemployment rate in Texas spiked to a record 13.5% in April and fell to 8.6% in June, leading to an estimated 1.6 million Texans losing their job-based health insurance coverage (Kaiser Health Foundation). As people lost their jobs, many also lost their health insurance coverage.\n\nA July report from Families USA estimates that about 5.4 million people across the country became uninsured after losing their jobs between February and May of this year and could not find new coverage. In Texas, an estimated 659,000 adult workers lost insurance coverage after losing jobs and could not find coverage elsewhere, bringing the rate of uninsured adults in the state at the end of May to 29%, or about 1 in 3 adults (Families USA).\n\nBased on these estimates, it can be inferred that the number of people without health insurance coverage in Texas has increased since the pandemic began. While the exact number of people without access to health care insurance is difficult to determine due to fluctuating unemployment rates and changing eligibility requirements for Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's marketplace tax credits, it is clear that a significant portion of the population under 65 in Texas does not have access to health care coverage.

According to the article, Cox supported President Donald Trump's stance on separating immigrant parents from their children at the border, saying \"that\u2019s a congressional problem.\" However, when asked later in the article if he supports separating families, Cox replied that he is \"against\" it. This contradicts Newsom's claim that Cox has \"parroted Trump\" on the issue of family separation.\n\nWhile the term \"parroted\" may suggest a direct copycat of Trump's words, the evidence provided shows that Cox's views are not in complete alignment with Trump's. While both Cox and Trump place blame on Congress for the family separations, Cox does not specifically blame Democrats like Trump does. Additionally, Cox has expressed opposition to separating families, which contradicts Newsom's claim that he shares Trump's views on the issue.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label the claim as \"Conflicting.\" There is evidence to suggest that Cox's views on family separation are not in line with Trump's, and the quote from Newsom does not accurately represent Cox's position on the issue."

    "justification": "The claim \"President Barack Obama's healthcare law is 'expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs'\" is misleading because of how the term \"destruction\" is used inaccurately. The Congressional Budget Office did not say that employers will lay off 2.3 million workers, but rather that workers will choose to reduce their hours voluntarily due to new options for purchasing health insurance outside of their jobs. The CBO estimated that Obamacare would \"reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024,\" which is almost entirely due to workers deciding to supply less labor. Additionally, the CBO did not specify how many of the 2 million figure would include full-time positions.\n\nTherefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the claim made by President Obama's critic John Boehner is misleading based on the evidence provided by the Congressional Budget Office.

Specifically, the participation rate was 63.8% in May 2012 compared to 65.7% in January 2009. If the same percentage of Americans were employed or looking for work in May 2012 as in January 2009, the general unemployment rate would have been 11% instead of 8.2%.\n\nTo support this claim, Paul Ryan's office provided data, calculations, and supporting news coverage. The data shows that if the same percentage of Americans were employed or looking for work in May 2012 as in January 2009, there would be 4.6 million more people actively seeking work right now, leading to an unemployment rate of 11.2%.\n\nThe math is straightforward: if the labor force participation rate were the same as when Obama became president, the total labor force would be larger, and the unemployment rate would be higher. The evidence supports this claim, and it is reasonable to conclude that if the labor force participation rate were the same as when Obama became president, unemployment would be 11%.\n\nIt is important to note that the assumptions underlying this claim are critical. The claim assumes that all 4.6 million adults added to the labor force would be unemployed, which may not be the case. Additionally, the claim uses BLS figures that were not rounded off as much as the ones Seifert used to describe his math to us, which could affect the result slightly.

This implies that the increase in energy costs will be over a longer period of time than 16 percent per year.\n\nMoreover, the estimate of a 16 percent increase by 2030 is based on conservative assumptions and does not include costs for upgrades. ERCOT stands by this estimate, indicating that it is correct. Therefore, the claim made by Rep.

While there are estimates of compliance costs provided in the article, none of them support the specific figure of $500 billion that Senator Cruz claimed.

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" accurately reflects Karen Huber's position on Texas 45 Southwest. While she has taken actions to oppose the project, such as introducing resolutions to remove it from the county plans and delete it from the Metropolitan Transportation Plan entirely, her statements suggest that she does not necessarily want to stop the road outright.\n\nIn an interview with the Austin American-Statesman, Huber stated, \"I'm saying, on that road, that I do not believe we should move forward with it till we conclude that it is going to do what they say it is going to do\" (in easing Brodie traffic). This suggests that Huber wants to wait until there is more evidence demonstrating the road's effectiveness before supporting its construction.\n\nAdditionally, Huber's actions on the project align with her position of prioritizing transportation projects that demonstrate a higher need and higher priority. As a member of the CAMPO board, she has expressed concerns about spending money on projects without effectively justifying them. This suggests that she is willing to oppose projects that do not meet her standards for need and priority, even if it means removing them from the plan.\n\nOverall, while Huber's actions may have been seen as opposition to the Texas 45 Southwest project, her statements suggest that she is motivated by a desire to ensure that any transportation projects in the area are properly justified and meet the needs of the community. This aligns with the label \"Conflicting,\" which indicates that there may be conflicting views or positions on an issue, rather than a clear and unequivocal stance one way or the other."

    "justification": "The claim that President Ronald Reagan oversaw a month when employment shot up by 1 million jobs is false.

However, the evidence also highlights that the Justice Department has never placed a high priority on pursuing perjury charges from background checks, with only 15/100th of 1 percent of cases prosecuted under Bush and 8/100th of 1 percent of cases prosecuted under Obama. This suggests that the claim by Rep. Goodlatte may be missing important context and glosses over the fact that the low number of prosecutions is due to a lack of priority placed on pursuing these charges, rather than any intentional action by President Obama. Therefore, while there is some evidence to support the claim, it is also unclear and subject to interpretation based on the provided evidence."

    "justification": "The claim that Hillary Clinton spent 18 months putting together sanctions against Iran in order to force them to the negotiating table is supported by the evidence provided. As Secretary of State, Clinton played a major role in leading the diplomatic lobbying effort to get other countries to join the U.S. plan to pressure Iran, overcoming large hurdles such as getting Russia and China to get on board. The State Department led the way in pressing for international sanctions against Iran, which were approved by the United Nations Security Council in June 2010. These sanctions enabled even tougher measures from the United States and the European Union, which were passed immediately. Clinton appointed a special adviser in 2010 to oversee U.S. efforts \"to ensure full and effective implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Iran.\"\n\nExperts agree that Clinton is correct to take some of the credit for the rapid increase in international sanctions on Iran, which were a big part of the reason why Iran rejoined multilateral talks about its nuclear program. While other players were also involved, the State Department was key to getting other countries to go along with and add to U.S. efforts to pressure Iran. Clinton's claim does not give enough credit to other players, but is essentially correct.\n\nThe evidence provided shows that Hillary Clinton played a crucial role in leading the effort to impose international sanctions on Iran, which were instrumental in forcing Iran to the negotiating table.

    "justification": "The label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim that police in the United States are allowed to use tear gas even though it has been classified as a chemical weapon and banned in international conflict since 1993. The evidence provided in the article supports this claim.\n\nFirstly, the article states that the Chemical Weapons Convention bans the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer or use of chemical weapons, including tear gas. This suggests that tear gas is considered a chemical weapon under international law. However, the convention also allows for the use of riot control agents, including tear gas, for domestic purposes such as controlling riots and maintaining public order. Therefore, while tear gas may be banned in international conflict, it is not prohibited for use within a country.\n\nSecondly, the article highlights that there may be a gray area for use by the military. According to an agreement signed by President Gerald Ford in the 1970s, the United States reserved the right to use tear gas in limited circumstances, such as controlling a riot at a prisoner-of-war detention area. This suggests that there is some flexibility in the use of tear gas for military purposes, even if it is banned in international conflict.\n\nFinally, the article notes that there are few immediate alternatives to tear gas for riot control, and that even though tear gas is far from perfect, it continues to be used in that role because there's nothing else better. This suggests that while there may be some ethical or moral concerns about the use of tear gas, it remains a practical tool for law enforcement purposes.\n\nBased on these points, the label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim that police in the United States are allowed to use tear gas even though it has been classified as a chemical weapon and banned in international conflict since 1993."

    "justification": "The claim that \"Over 97 percent of the scientific community believes that humans are contributing to climate change\" is supported by the evidence provided in the article. The evidence includes several studies that have been cited by NASA and other organizations, which together demonstrate a broad consensus among actively publishing climate scientists that human activities are causing global warming.\n\nThe first study cited in the article is a 2013 study by John Cook and his co-authors, which examined 11,944 abstracts of climate science reports published from 1991 to 2011. The study found that among the roughly 4,000 studies that expressed an opinion on man-made global warming, 97.1 percent endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. Additionally, Cook's team surveyed a sample of 1,200 authors of the climate reports and found that 97.2 percent of the papers that expressed an opinion on man-made global warming backed the position that it's caused by human activity.\n\nAnother study cited in the article is a January 2009 study by researchers at the University of Illinois, which surveyed 3,146 earth scientists and found that 90 percent of them believed that global warming was occurring and 82 percent said human activities were a key reason. A smaller survey of climate change researchers who actively published their results found that 75 of 77 of them, or 97.4 percent, said human activity is a significant driver of climate change.\n\nThe article also references a National Academy of Sciences study from 2010 that created a database of 908 climate researchers who had their work published at least 20 times in scientific journals. The study found that roughly 90 percent of the climate researchers were convinced that rising temperatures are being caused by human activity, while 10 percent were not convinced. However, the more expertise the researchers had, the greater their consensus.\n\nFinally, a poll of roughly 1,800 meteorologists by the American Meteorological Society found that 73 percent of those surveyed felt that humans contributed to global warming.\n\nTaken together, these studies provide strong evidence for the claim that over 97 percent of the scientific community believes that humans are contributing to climate change. The consensus is based on the broad agreement among actively publishing climate scientists, as well as the consistency of the findings across multiple studies and organizations. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, it can be argued that the claim that CIA Director George Tenet told the Bush administration that the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack was coming is false. The article text and the special commission created to investigate the attacks indicate that while there was a lot of chatter about potential attacks in the months leading up to 9/11, there was no specific information that indicated an imminent attack on U.S. soil.\n\nFirstly, the article text states that \"the system was blinking red\" in the months before the September 2001 attacks, indicating a high level of urgency and threat reports. However, despite this, there were doubters within the intelligence community, including Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, who thought perhaps Osama bin Ladin was trying to study U.S. reactions. Tenet shot down this idea, suggesting that there was no specific information indicating an imminent attack.\n\nFurthermore, the special commission's timeline revealed a consensus that the target lay outside America's borders, with one prominent exception - an Aug. 6 briefing document written by two CIA analysts. This document stated that bin Laden said he wanted to attack the United States directly and was expected to plan patiently, and mentioned suspicious surveillance of federal buildings in New York. However, as the commission report notes, this document did not lead to any meetings of the interagency Counterterrorism Security Group or the National Security Council to discuss a domestic attack.\n\nFinally, the commission interviewed George W. Bush as part of its investigation and included his response to the briefing document. Bush stated that the August 6 report was historical in nature and that he had known about bin Laden's desire to attack America since he became President. He also mentioned that 70 investigations were underway in the United States, which suggests that while there was concern about potential attacks, there was no specific information indicating an imminent attack on U.S. soil.\n\nBased on these points, it can be argued that the claim that CIA Director George Tenet told the Bush administration that the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack was coming is false. There is no evidence to support this claim, and the available evidence suggests that while there was concern about potential attacks in the months leading up to 9/11, there was no specific information indicating an imminent attack on U.S. soil."

This is evident in his statement in the audiobook: \"If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, people like me would go in and buy like crazy.\" Similarly, during the CNN interview in 2009, Trump stated that he believed the economic situation was a \"great opportunity\" for investors to purchase properties.\n\nThe evidence presented does not indicate that Trump actively rooted for the housing crisis or took any steps to exacerbate it.

The article from PolitiFact provides evidence to support this claim by highlighting the following points:\n\n1. The last time the Democratic-led Senate passed a budget was on April 29, 2009.\n2. According to a status report compiled by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee, not one of the 12 spending bills has been considered by the full Senate this year.\n3.

The article states that Young voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which included changes to Medicare to slow its growth. While some may argue that these changes are not technically a \"cut\" in the traditional sense, as they aim to reduce costs through market competition and other means, the article itself acknowledges that both parties agree changes should be made to Medicare's entitlement program due to its growth problem.\n\nMoreover, the article highlights that Young voted for the budget blueprint of Rep. Paul Ryan, which factors in the same $716 billion in reductions in Medicare spending. This indicates that Young supports reducing Medicare spending, which aligns with his claim of opposing a $716 billion cut to Medicare.\n\nAdditionally, the article quotes economist Gail Wilensky, who states that it was known at the time of the bill's passage that there were major reductions in store for Medicare service providers. This supports Young's claim that he opposed a significant reduction in Medicare spending.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is appropriate to label Congressman Bill Young's claim as \"Conflicting\" because while he voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which included changes to Medicare, he also supported reducing Medicare spending through the budget blueprint of Rep.

While it is true that the Secure Fence Act of 2006 directed the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along the border with Mexico, the law did not require the fence to be built \"along the entire Mexican border.\" Instead, it specified specific segments of the border where double-fenced areas were required. Additionally, the law gave Border Patrol discretion to determine the most appropriate type of fencing in different areas, and it is not clear that the current fence is not complete or in compliance with the 2007 amendment. Furthermore, other resources such as hiring and maintaining existing levels of Border Patrol agents and customs officers, as well as communication and aerial surveillance equipment, have also been used to enhance border control.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is not accurate to say that the president is flagrantly defying the 2006 federal law.

According to the article, there were 16 roll call votes on amendments in 2014 and as of January 22nd, 2015, there had been 17 more votes on amendments to the bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. This means that there have been more votes on amendments in less than a month under new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell than in all of 2014 under former Majority Leader Harry Reid. The reason behind this difference is attributed to Reid's use of a procedural tactic called \"filling the amendment tree\" which allowed for fewer amendments to be heard on the floor, while McConnell has allowed more amendments to be voted on. Experts suggest that while this change may indicate a shift towards more cooperative policymaking, it is too early to determine whether this will lead to easier passage of amendments for Democrats."

On September 22, 1993, President Clinton gave a speech where he laid out his proposal based off the task force's findings, which included requiring all employers to provide insurance to workers. First Lady Clinton testified on the Hill for several days to explain and defend the plan before a handful of congressional committees. During her testimony, she expressed concerns about the individual mandate, stating that it would be an opportunity for employers to forgo providing insurance and push employees instead to the new individual market. She also expressed concerns about the administrative structure to track the individual contribution, collect it, and connect it with health insurance, which she believed would be extremely complicated and bureaucratic. However, she was not all that down on the individual mandate and considered it to be in the same ballpark as her plan, which was a means to universal coverage.\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, the label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim that Hillary Clinton opposed an individual mandate and favored an employer mandate in 1993."

While it is true that the number of employed blacks dropped by 540,000 people from January 2009 through August 2011, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, this decrease cannot be attributed solely to President Obama's policies.\n\nThe evidence provided by PolitiFact New Jersey suggests that there are several factors at play here, including the overall economic conditions during the Great Recession, which disproportionately affected black Americans. Additionally, other issues such as education and more training and employment services could help blacks get more jobs. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) acknowledges the high rate of unemployment for blacks but does not blame Obama.\n\nMoreover, Mychal Massie, chairman of the National Leadership Network of Black Conservatives, argues that blaming President Obama for the employment decline is misguided and ignores the broader structural issues that contribute to unemployment in the black community. He suggests that blaming Obama for not addressing these issues is unfair and disingenuous.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be some correlation between President Obama's policies and the employment rates among black Americans, it is not accurate to say that he is solely responsible for the decline in employment.

This suggests that the PAC was indeed trying to influence the outcome of the election by spending large amounts of money on attack ads against Greitens.\n\nSecondly, the article notes that the address for Jobs and Opportunity is also the address for the Democratic Governors Association, which further supports the claim that the PAC was acting in coordination with the Democratic Governors Association.\n\nThirdly, the article mentions that Greitens' campaign issued a press release titled \"Koster Caught in Conspiracy to Hijack Republican Primary,\" which suggests that Greitens believed that Koster and the Democratic Governors Association were working together to rig the election.\n\nFinally, the article quotes Austin Chambers, Greitens' campaign manager, as saying that no other Democratic groups launched attack ads against any other Republican gubernatorial candidate after the primary, which further supports the claim that the PAC's actions were unusual and targeted specifically at Greitens.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim made by Eric Greitens that the Democratic Governors Association and the Obama political machine came into a Republican primary to try and rig the election by spending $1 million against him in the last couple of days is supported by the evidence."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim made by Flinn's campaign is False. The evidence provided in the article shows that the unemployment rate in Shelby County was 5.5% when Cohen took office in 2007, which is significantly lower than the 9.7% claimed by Flinn's campaign. Additionally, the unemployment rate in Shelby County has fluctuated over time, with no evidence to suggest that Cohen is responsible for the current rate of 8.4%.\n\nThe article provides several sources to support this claim, including an associate professor of economics at Vanderbilt University and a university economics professor. They both agree that one member of Congress has limited control over the economy and unemployment rate, and that macroeconomic phenomena are influenced by events outside of government control.\n\nFurthermore, the article mentions that Cohen brought various economic developments to Memphis, such as the Minority Business Center, which aimed to provide access to business loans for racial minorities and women, and saved 500 jobs when he ensured that the American Steamship Company came to Memphis. These actions suggest that Cohen has taken steps to improve the economic situation in Memphis and Shelby County, which contradicts Flinn's claim that he has not delivered.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that Flinn's claim that the unemployment rate in Shelby County has reached 9.7% under Cohen's tenure is False."

    "justification": "The label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim \"\"We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.\"\" because the evidence provided in the article supports this statement. The article explains that the civilian labor force participation rate, which measures the number of Americans in the labor force as a percentage of the total civilian population, is at its lowest level since the 1970s. This suggests that fewer Americans are working compared to previous years. Additionally, while the employment-population ratio, which measures the number of people employed relative to the total population age 16 and above, has improved in recent years, it is still below its pre-recession highs. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the claim is true."

    "justification": "The claim that the government's support for research and development (R&D) has fallen by nearly two-thirds since the 1960s is supported by the evidence provided in the article. According to the chart from a 2007 Congressional Budget Office report, federal expenditures for R&D peaked in 1964 at 1.92 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), but by 2008, the percentage had dropped to .73 percent, representing a decrease of 62 percent or nearly two-thirds. This evidence supports the label \"True\".\n\nThe article explains that the loss of federal support has been cushioned by industry funding, but it also highlights the limitations of industry investment in late-stage research and development. The article quotes Patrick Clemins, director of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's R&D Budget and Policy Program, who notes that while industry invests in projects with a high potential for profit, they are less likely to fund big ideas or take risks. Debbie Hart, president of BioNJ, also raises concerns about the impact of declining federal support on the economy and society as a whole.\n\nThe justification for the label \"True\" is based solely on the evidence provided in the article, which shows a significant decrease in the government's support for R&D since the 1960s. While industry funding may be providing some support for R&D, the evidence suggests that the overall level of investment in this area has decreased significantly over time."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, it can be justified that the claim that Stephen Webber \"voted to allow sex offenders to be within 500 feet of childcare centers and playgrounds, and even voted to allow sex offenders to be coaches\" is Conflicting. The article provides a detailed explanation of how the bill changed between its original version and the final version that was passed by the Senate, and how Webber's vote differed based on these changes.\n\nFirstly, the article clarifies that Webber voted in favor of the original version of the bill that aimed to prevent sex offenders from being near childcare centers and playgrounds, as well as from serving as coaches for children under 17 years of age. This suggests that Webber initially supported stricter regulations against sex offenders.\n\nHowever, when the bill returned from the Senate with an exemption clause allowing certain offenders to petition to have their names removed from the sexual offender registry, Webber voted against the final version of the bill. According to the campaign manager for Webber, Emily Waggoner, this was due to the new exemption language in the final bill, which Webber believed weakened the original version of the bill.\n\nThe article then goes on to provide a detailed analysis of the changes made between the original and final versions of the bill, confirming that the specific language cited by Webber's campaign as the reason for his change in vote existed in the final bill. This suggests that Webber's opposition to the final version of the bill was not due to a lack of support for stricter regulations against sex offenders, but rather due to his belief that the exemption clause weakened the original bill.\n\nBased on this evidence, it can be concluded that Webber's vote against the final version of the bill was not a blanket approval of sex offenders being near childcare centers and playgrounds or serving as coaches for children under 17 years of age. Rather, his vote was based on his belief that the exemption clause undermined the original stricter regulations against sex offenders. Therefore, the label Conflicting is appropriate."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the given claim because the evidence provided does not clearly support either side of the contrast made between Rep. Carol Shea-Porter and Frank Guinta. While the ad produced by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) highlights Shea-Porter's voting record with Nancy Pelosi's Democrats, it is pointed out that Guinta also votes similarly with his party. The evidence provided in the article footnotes both candidates' voting records, showing that they have voted in virtual partisan lockstep.\n\nThe NRCC's ad creates a stark contrast between Shea-Porter and Guinta in terms of their voting patterns, implying that Guinta is more independent and bipartisan. However, the evidence provided shows that this contrast may not be as clear-cut as it seems, as both candidates have similar voting records. The article notes that Guinta's votes are \"barely distinguishable\" from Shea-Porter's, with a partisan unity score of 96% in his term in Congress.\n\nIn conclusion, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the evidence provided does not clearly support one side of the contrast made between the two candidates in terms of their voting patterns. Both candidates have similar voting records, and the difference may be more a matter of nuance than a clear divide."

    "justification": "The claim made by President Obama that \"Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined\" is appropriate given the supporting article text (evidence). The evidence provided shows that the United States has experienced net job growth of about 8.4 million people from 2010 to 2015, which is higher than the growth experienced by other advanced economies outside of the United States. While the President's wording of \"putting more people back to work\" may be open to interpretation, the evidence does support the claim that the United States has seen a greater increase in employment compared to other advanced economies.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the President's claim could be interpreted as implying that the United States has put all of those people \"back to work,\" which may not accurately reflect the reality of the situation. The evidence provided does show that the number of people who have returned to work in the United States exceeds the net total for all other advanced economies combined, but it does not necessarily mean that all of those people were previously unemployed and have now found work again. It is possible that some of those people may be entering the workforce for the first time, or that others may be changing jobs or industries.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence provided also shows that while the number of long-term unemployed Americans has fallen consistently from its recession peak, the labor force participation rate has fallen consistently since President Obama took office, which suggests that some people may have given up on finding work. This could potentially mitigate the President's claim that \"we\u2019ve put more people back to work\" in recent years.\n\nIn conclusion, while the evidence provided does support the President's claim that the United States has experienced net job growth and put more people back to work than other advanced economies, it is important to interpret the claim with caution and recognize that it may not accurately reflect the full complexity of the situation."

    "justification": "Based on the provided evidence, I believe the label of False is the most appropriate for the claim \"The proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment primarily due to marijuana use has reached its highest point in 20 years.\"\n\nFirstly, the statement made by Kathleen Sullivan, Warren's substance abuse coordinator, is not supported by the data provided. The data shows that the rate of admissions for substance abuse treatment in Rhode Island has been declining since 2009, rather than reaching a 20-year high. In 1993, the rate of admissions was 96 per 100,000 Rhode Islanders age 12 and older, but by 2011, it had decreased to 166 admissions. While there is a slight increase in the trend line since 1999, it is not statistically significant. Therefore, Sullivan's statement cannot be supported by the evidence provided.\n\nSecondly, the U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) officials confirmed that there are limitations to the data, which make Sullivan's position problematic. The TEDS (Treatment Episode Data Set) data does not support the assertion that the number of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment has reached its highest point in 20 years. According to Smith, a statistician with the administration's Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, the percentages have remained relatively stable.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the claim \"The proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment primarily due to marijuana use has reached its highest point in 20 years\" is False."

However, the article also notes that Trump did not call for a unilateral war against bin Laden's al-Qaida terror network in his book and did not make the claim that he \"predicted\" bin Laden until his speeches this year.\n\nThe evidence suggests that while Trump may have expressed some concerns about Osama bin Laden in his book, he did not make a clear call for action against him at that time. The article does not provide any direct evidence to support the claim that Trump \"predicted\" bin Laden in his 2000 book, and it is possible that Trump is exaggerating or misremembering his views on this topic. Therefore, the label Conflicting is appropriate for this statement.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that Trump's statement \"We\u2019ve got to take him out\" is not entirely accurate and does not accurately reflect his views as expressed in his book.

While Lenny Curry, the head of the Republican Party of Florida, mentions President Obama's promise on gas prices, there is no specific mention of a price of $2.50 per gallon. In fact, the article states that Obama's closest statement to a promise on gas prices was a comment made in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in April 2008, where he expressed his desire to invest in clean and affordable energy sources.\n\nMoreover, the article provides evidence to contradict Curry's claim. It states that Obama has broken one significant gas-related promise, which was to enact a \"windfall profits\" tax on oil companies. Additionally, the article mentions that aides said the tax was not necessary after gas prices fell from their 2008 highs. This suggests that Obama did not make any specific promise regarding gas prices.\n\nFurthermore, the article provides an analysis by James Bartis of the RAND Corporation, who states that it takes many years to open up a new oil field and prepare for production, therefore, it is difficult for any president to affect short-term gas prices. This supports the conclusion that Obama did not make a promise on gas prices at $2.50 per gallon.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the article, it can be concluded that the claim that Barack Obama \"promised\" gasoline at $2.50 per gallon is False."

The evidence provided in the article suggests that while some foreign companies did receive funding from the stimulus program, the majority of the money went to American companies and created jobs in the United States.\n\nFirstly, the article states that \"the largest stimulus program to develop alternative energy had handed out $2.1 billion for wind, solar and geothermal power, and of that, 79 percent went to companies based overseas.\" However, the article also provides evidence that the majority of the equipment purchased was from foreign companies, but the bulk of the jobs created were short-term construction jobs. This suggests that while some money may have gone overseas, the majority of the funding went to American companies and created jobs in the United States.\n\nSecondly, the article provides a study by the U.S. Department of Energy that estimates the domestic portion on wind projects ranges from 48 percent to 66 percent of the total investment. This suggests that a significant portion of the money went towards creating American jobs in the renewable energy sector.\n\nFinally, the article quotes a spokesman for the American Wind Energy Association, Peter Kelley, who states that \"it\u2019s important to draw foreign investment that creates jobs here in the U.S.\" This suggests that while some funding may have gone overseas, the goal of the program was to create American jobs and stimulate the domestic economy.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the claim is Conflicting.

The U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey estimated median annual earnings for men and women who worked full-time, year-round over the prior 12 months, which showed a similar gap of $7,128 between men and women in Florida.\n\nThe article also provides additional context to explain why there is a gender wage gap in Florida. The high level of working single mothers in the state, as well as the lower education and fewer quality job opportunities available to them, contribute to the gap. Additionally, the article notes that men in Florida are likelier to earn less than the national average at a greater rate than women, which also contributes to the smaller gap between men and women's earnings.\n\nOverall, the evidence provided in the article supports the claim that women in Florida make 83 cents for every dollar a man makes. The gender wage gap in Florida is significant, but it is also influenced by various factors such as occupation, education, and job opportunities."

This contradicts Medeiros' statement that the government offers special small business grants for ex-cons.\n\nSecondly, the document linked to by Medeiros actually talks about a free bond, worth $5,000 to $25,000, given out by the Federal Bonding Program, which is financed by the U.S. Department of Labor and administered by individual states.

Furthermore, the article notes that the 2006 property tax reduction was partly funded by tax increases and that the total taxable value of property in Texas rose each year from 2005 to 2007, which could have contributed to an increase in school property tax collections despite the rate reductions. The article concludes that while Dewhurst may have supported various tax-cut proposals passed into law during his tenure as lieutenant governor, he did not personally cut any taxes and his powers were limited to appointing committees and setting the Senate's floor agenda.

This suggests that a significant portion of Floridians will indeed lose their coverage due to the withdrawal of insurance companies from the marketplace.\n\nHowever, the article also provides an explanation for why this loss of coverage is not necessarily a bad thing. According to Timothy Jost, author of the Health Affairs Blog and emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law, while some Floridians will lose their current plan, they will still be insured as they can sign up for another plan. Jost notes that the premium could be similar for most shoppers since the amount is based on tax credits that are set based on a consumer's income. He also points out that while the state said that premiums will increase on average 19%, this is before the tax credits that apply to many buying on the marketplace.\n\nDavid Himmelstein, professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College, also notes that while some Floridians may have to change insurers, it is not necessarily a bad thing as they will still be insured and have access to healthcare. He acknowledges that some may end up with worse or more expensive coverage, but argues that this is not the same as losing coverage entirely.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that while some Floridians will lose their current coverage due to the withdrawal of insurance companies from the marketplace, they will still have access to healthcare through other plans. Therefore, the label Conflicting is appropriate for Senator Rubio's claim."

    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim made by Senator Marco Rubio that people who have a doctor they've been seeing for 15 or 20 years will not be able to keep going to that doctor under Obamacare is partially accurate but also misleading. While it is true that some patients may face challenges in keeping their current doctor under the Affordable Care Act, the evidence provided in the article suggests that this effect will not be limited to Obamacare alone.\n\nExperts agree that there are already ways in which people can lose access to their doctor, even without the Affordable Care Act. For instance, companies can switch health care plans, and some employees' doctors may not be in the new network. Additionally, employees can lose their job - or switch jobs - and end up with a different plan that doesn't include the same doctor. These changes are already happening due to natural job turnover, and they will continue to occur even after the Affordable Care Act is implemented.\n\nThe article also provides evidence that the health care law leaves in place the current health insurance system, so switching plans and possibly doctors will still happen. However, the law also puts more requirements on insurance companies, which means that they have to offer more comprehensive coverage. This could lead to some patients finding new doctors through their insurance plans.\n\nWhile it is true that some patients may find themselves in a situation where their new plan isn't in the network, the article provides examples of how this can happen under current circumstances as well. Therefore, while Senator Rubio's claim has some truth to it, it is also misleading to suggest that Obamacare will cause a significant number of patients to lose access to their current doctors.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is partially accurate to say that people who have a doctor they've been seeing for 15 or 20 years may face challenges in keeping that doctor under Obamacare. However, it is also important to recognize that this effect will not be limited to the Affordable Care Act and that there are already ways in which patients can lose access to their doctors due to natural job turnover and changes in health insurance plans."

Additionally, the study does not take into account the age distribution of the net immigrant population growth and net native population growth, which could affect the employment rates of immigrants. As a result, the certainty of Romney's statistic is weakened.\n\nBoth the report's authors and its critics have reasonable points, highlighting the methodological shortcomings of the study.

For large group plans, the threshold is higher, requiring insurers to spend at least 85% of premium dollars on health care and quality improvement, leaving 15% for administration, marketing, and profit.\n\nMoreover, the provision does not limit insurance companies' ability to work with doctors and hospitals to improve quality or services that affect consumers, such as navigating complicated delivery systems, modernizing technology, and preventing fraud and abuse. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the federal government tells health insurance companies how much money they are allowed to keep of what they receive in revenues.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it seems that Santorum's statement is an oversimplification of the medical loss ratio provision and does not accurately reflect the actual regulations in place.

    "justification": "The claim that Gov. Rick Scott's proposal would allow \"a potential of 168 hours (of early voting), which I think is the most we\u2019ve ever had,\" is true based on the provided evidence. According to the article, Florida's history with early voting is short, and the current law gives supervisors the choice of offering between eight and 14 days of early voting, while maintaining six to 12 hours each day. Under Scott's proposal, supervisors would be able to provide a maximum of 168 hours of early voting (14 days multiplied by 12 hours a day). Therefore, the label True is appropriate.\n\nThe article provides evidence that supports the claim. It mentions that former Gov. Jeb Bush signed early voting into law in 2004, which required early voting to start 15 days before an election, with at least eight hours per weekday and eight hours total for each weekend. Voters had 104 early voting hours. However, the article also notes that even though election supervisors asked for more hours and more locations, Bush and the GOP-led Legislature passed a new law in 2005 that reduced hours and confined voting to election offices, city halls, and libraries. Under the new law, early voting lasted 14 days, for eight hours on weekdays and a total of eight hours on the weekend. That\u2019s 96 hours.\n\nFurthermore, the article states that in 2011, the Legislature passed a sweeping elections law that reduced the amount of days for early voting from 14 to eight. The new law gave supervisors a choice of offering between six and 12 hours of early voting each day. Therefore, the maximum number of hours of early voting under Scott's proposal is 168 hours, which is more than the previous highest number of hours provided in Florida.\n\nOverall, the evidence presented in the article supports the claim that Gov. Rick Scott's proposal would allow \"a potential of 168 hours (of early voting), which I think is the most we\u2019ve ever had.\" Therefore, the label True is appropriate."

This means that companies need to employ fewer workers, resulting in job losses. The estimate of 500,000 job losses is provided as the central estimate, indicating that the actual number of job losses could be higher or lower.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, the claim that \"Half a million people would lose their jobs if you raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour\" is supported by the Congressional Budget Office report and is therefore true."

Furthermore, when comparing the amounts raised by President Obama in his 2012 re-election campaign, it was revealed that Wall Street sent him $10 million less than in his previous campaign.

    "justification": "The label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim \"\"8.5 million Americans have gotten rebate checks because their insurance companies were spending too much money on executive bonuses and administrative costs and not enough on health care.\"\" The evidence provided supports this claim, as it states that in 2013, insurance companies returned $1.1 billion in rebates to 13.1 million policyholders, with an average rebate of $98 per person. This means that approximately 8.85 million people received rebates, which is close to the original estimate of 8.5 million provided by Axelrod.\n\nThe evidence also explains why the rebates were issued. The Affordable Care Act requires health insurance companies to spend at least 80% of their premiums on medical care, not administrative costs. If a company fails to meet this ratio, they must return the difference to their policyholders in the form of rebates. The evidence shows that in 2013, insurance companies returned $1.1 billion in rebates to 13.1 million policyholders, which is consistent with the claim made by Axelrod.\n\nWhile some critics have pointed out that not all policyholders received physical checks, the evidence shows that a significant portion of them did. Approximately one-third, or 2.9 million people, received rebates for coverage in the individual market in 2013. The rest of the rebates went to small and large employers who manage health insurance plans for their employees, with the rebate split proportionately between the employer and employee.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, the claim that \"8.5 million Americans have gotten rebate checks because their insurance companies were spending too much money on executive bonuses and administrative costs and not enough on health care\" is supported by the data.

The Business Roundtable survey cited in the article found that 50% of responding CEOs indicated that the ongoing disagreement in Washington over the 2014 budget and the debt ceiling is having a negative impact on their plans for hiring additional employees over the next six months. This is the exact figure mentioned by President Obama in his public address.\n2. The survey was conducted among a representative sample of CEOs from large companies, as determined by factors such as revenue, industry, and market capitalization. While the exact question wording was not disclosed to the author, the fact that the survey was conducted among a representative sample of CEOs lends credibility to the findings.\n3. Other business groups, such as the National Federation of Independent Businesses, have also reported similar sentiments among their members. This suggests that the impact of the shutdown on hiring plans is not limited to any one industry or group of businesses, but rather is a broader trend.\n4. The article cites experts in the field who explain why CEOs might be hesitant to hire during this time, including concerns about tighter fiscal policy and consumer behavior. These factors could contribute to a delay in hiring plans, as CEOs may be hesitant to make decisions in an uncertain economic environment.\n\nOverall, the evidence provided in the article supports the claim that half of all CEOs have set back their hiring plans over the next six months due to the shutdown and threat of default.

    "justification": "Based solely on the evidence provided in the article, it is difficult to accurately determine the number of radicalized Muslims worldwide. The evidence presented suggests that there is significant variation in how different countries and sects interpret and support Sharia law, which complicates efforts to reach a definitive conclusion about the number of radicalized Muslims.\n\nBen Shapiro's argument that there are over 800 million radicalized Muslims, which he arrived at by extrapolating from polling data on support for Sharia law, is questionable for several reasons. Firstly, Shapiro consistently uses the highest percentages available in the surveys to maximize the number of Muslims he can tag with the \"radical\" label (para 3). This methodology is flawed because it does not account for the fact that different branches of Islam use different versions of the law, and that support for Sharia law varies widely among countries and sects.\n\nSecondly, Shapiro's definition of radicalism is overly broad, as he considers any support for Sharia law to be a marker of radicalism (para 4). However, as James Bell, director of International Survey Research at Pew, notes, many Muslims will say they want religious judges deciding family or property disputes, but may not support corporal punishments for criminals or the death penalty for apostates (para 5). This suggests that there is a degree of nominal faithfulness among Muslims when it comes to their views on Sharia law.\n\nFinally, the article presents alternative measures of radicalism that could lead to a distinct minority rather than a majority of radicalized Muslims (para 6-7). For example, using the percentage of Muslims who support suicide bombings against civilian targets as an alternate measure of radicalism, the total number of radicalized Muslims could be significantly lower than Shapiro's claim.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence presented in the article, it is difficult to accurately determine the number of radicalized Muslims worldwide. While Shapiro's argument that there are over 800 million radicalized Muslims may seem persuasive at first glance, it is flawed by its reliance on high percentages and an overly broad definition of radicalism. A more nuanced approach to measuring radicalization among Muslims would take into account the varying interpretations and support for Sharia law across different countries and sects."

The evidence provided shows that Clinton was in the hospital for about four days in December 2012, not 30 days, and that the glasses she wore were related to issues stemming from her concussion.\n\nSteven Galetta, chair of the Neurology Department at New York University Medical Center, explained that about 30 to 50 percent of concussions lead to some kind of visual problem, including double vision, which can be managed with prismatic glasses. The glasses are designed to help with blurred or double vision and are often optional, depending on how quickly the person wants to get back to work. Galetta said that most patients resolve the issues on their own, but that some may need optional treatment like prismatic glasses.\n\nDoug Smith, professor of neurosurgery and director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania, also noted that a concussion is technically a mild traumatic brain injury, but that Rove's characterization of Clinton's concussion as a traumatic brain injury generated concern among physicians. Smith explained that the public may not understand how broadly the term applies, as the Centers for Disease Control report that 2.2 million head injuries sent people to the emergency room in 2010.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that Karl Rove's claim about Hillary Clinton's hospital stay and glasses is false.

While some experts have expressed concerns about the cuts, the evidence indicates that the number of soldiers in the Army will indeed be reduced by 40,000 over the next few years.\n\nIt is worth noting that the label of \"True\" does not necessarily imply that these cuts are desirable or necessary, but rather that they are currently planned and underway. The issue of military spending and force size is a complex one, and there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate. However, based solely on the evidence provided, the label of \"True\" is appropriate for this claim."

    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that President Barack Obama \"spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs\" is False. The evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim in several ways:\n\n1. Not all of the stimulus money went to paying government employees. Only a modest (though uncertain) fraction did, with more than two-thirds of the total going towards tax benefits and entitlement payments for individuals and businesses.\n2. The third category of spending, worth $261.2 billion, included funding for some government jobs, such as teachers, but a sizable chunk of this money was used by the government to fund work carried out by the private sector, such as road-building companies and hazardous-waste cleanup contractors.\n3. The article notes that neither the federal government nor government as a whole has seen a surge in employment, with the size of the federal workforce declining by 69,000 since Obama took office, and government employment plunging by 734,000 jobs. This suggests that the stimulus did not lead to an increase in \"make-work\" government jobs.\n4. The term \"make-work\" is problematic because it implies that the work performed by government employees is unnecessary or useless. However, many of the projects funded by the stimulus, such as education and infrastructure, are important priorities for society and contribute to economic growth in a meaningful way.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the claim that President Obama \"spent nearly a trillion dollars on make-work government jobs\" is False. The evidence provided in the article does not support this claim, and instead suggests that the stimulus was used to fund important priorities and did not result in a significant increase in \"make-work\" government jobs."

The article from AARP disputes both of these claims. Firstly, AARP is a nonpartisan organization that does not endorse political candidates, including Joe Biden. Secondly, AARP has been vocal in its opposition to rationing healthcare based on age or disability, stating that it would be discriminatory and violate existing federal law. The article also quotes Nancy LeaMond, the organization's executive vice president, saying \"Using age or disability to categorically exclude people from accessing treatment would be discriminatory and AARP opposes it.\" There is no evidence to suggest that AARP advocates for the notion that life after 75 isn't worth living. In fact, the article highlights AARP's efforts to protect the elderly and other vulnerable groups from rationing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Allegations of racism about incidents that happened before Trump ran for president, including a 2015 New Yorker article that quotes a former Atlantic City casino employee who claims that Trump and his associates would order black people off the floor when they came to the casino.\n\nTaken together, these instances provide strong evidence that Donald Trump has been accused of racism many times throughout his career, long before he decided to run against the Democrats. Therefore, the claim that he was never once accused of being racist before running against the Democrats is false."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" accurately reflects the findings in the provided article. While the claim made by Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, that he reduced heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent during his tenure is supported by the data from the 2006 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey, there are some limitations and uncertainties associated with this claim.\n\nFirstly, the survey data shows a decrease in heroin use among Florida youth between 2000 and 2006, but the rate of change is not linear and there are minimal changes between 2002 and 2006. This suggests that Bush's policies may not have had a significant impact on heroin use over the entire duration of his term in office.\n\nSecondly, drug-policy experts interviewed in the article express skepticism about the steepness of the decline in heroin use reported in the survey. They suggest that one-year changes in lifetime prevalence rates for heroin use are subject to error and may not be plausible. Additionally, they note that broader demographic and social trends likely had a bigger impact on heroin use among youth during this period.\n\nFinally, while Bush's office created a drug policy office out of his own office to coordinate law enforcement, treatment, education, and prevention efforts, and he championed community-based anti-drug coalitions that helped consolidate prevention efforts, it is unclear whether these efforts had a significant impact on heroin use rates. Drug-policy experts interviewed in the article note that such efforts likely had a \"marginal influence\" on heroin-use rates at best.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the article, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether Bush's policies were effective in reducing heroin use among youth in Florida. While there is some evidence to suggest that heroin use declined during Bush's term in office, there are also limitations and uncertainties associated with this claim.

This provision did not give the President blanket authority to admit refugees without background checks, but rather provided a specific mechanism for granting legal status to certain refugees.\n\nSecondly, the article notes that Section 3403 of the bill would have allowed the President to designate a group of interest to the United States as being persecuted as a whole. This provision was intended to streamline the vetting process for refugees, not eliminate it entirely. The experts quoted in the article emphasize that all refugees, including those designated under this section, would still be subject to the normal refugee limit and would continue to undergo rigorous security background checks.\n\nFinally, the article points out that Section 3401 would have repealed the one-year deadline for refugees to file for asylum once they arrive in the United States. This provision would have given people who had applications rejected for missing the window another two years to apply again, but again, this did not give the President blanket authority to admit refugees without background checks.\n\nBased on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim that the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight bill gave President Obama \"blanket authority\" to admit refugees without mandating any background checks is False."

However, it is important to note that the budget's balance was not solely due to Gingrich's actions, as the tech boom and a surging economy also played a significant role in the budget's balancing.\n\nThe evidence provided supports Gingrich's statement that the 1997 Balanced Budget Act contributed to the budget's balance, but it does not solely responsibility for the budget's balancing. The article notes that Gingrich opposed crucial tax-raising bills in 1990 and 1993, which also made a difference in the budget's balance.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label Newt Gingrich's claim as True. While Gingrich played a role in shaping the federal budget during his time as speaker, the budget's balance was ultimately the result of a combination of factors, including economic growth and the passage of important tax-raising bills."

    "justification": "The claim that Barack Obama had \"huge majorities\" in Congress during his first two years in office and \"did nothing with them to create jobs in America\" is False. The evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim.\n\nFirstly, the article mentions that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, signed into law less than a month into Obama's presidency, allocated about $787 billion in federal spending and tax benefits. This legislation aimed to create and save jobs, and according to independent economists, it had a positive impact on job creation. The Congressional Budget Office and other economists have projected that the stimulus bill increased the number of people employed by between 1 million and 2.9 million in the second quarter of 2011.\n\nSecondly, the article provides evidence that Obama's administration did take action to create jobs during his first two years in office. The article mentions that funding recipients have reported jobs supported by stimulus dollars, and that the government-run website recovery.gov tracks jobs funded by the stimulus, with over 6,300 full-time equivalent jobs in New Jersey funded by the stimulus in just one quarter.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that Obama's administration did take action to create jobs during his first two years in office, and the claim that he \"did nothing\" is false."

For example, the article notes that Massachusetts has state-mandated tests for students in grades three through eight, in addition to the high school tests mentioned by Ratliff. This suggests that Massachusetts may have a more comprehensive approach to standardized testing than Finland, which does not have any mandatory exams beyond the senior year high school exam.\n\nMoreover, the article highlights differences in the way each country approaches education and testing, with Finland focusing on well-prepared teachers who decide how best to educate their individual pupils, while Massachusetts has a more structured approach to standardized testing.

While it is true that some Supreme Court nominees have received unanimous support or met the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, this is not a traditional or universal requirement for confirmation.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article contradicts the claim of a 60-vote threshold. The article states that only four times in modern history has the chamber voted on cloture when confirming a Supreme Court nominee, and both of President Barack Obama's nominees won 60 votes and then some. This suggests that the requirement of 60 votes for confirmation is not traditional or universal.\n\nFurthermore, the article notes that while some nominees have received unanimous support or met the 60-vote threshold, this is not always the case. For example, Clarence Thomas was confirmed on a 52-48 vote, and Samuel Alito was confirmed on a 58-42 vote. This shows that the 60-vote threshold is not always met, and therefore cannot be considered traditional or universal.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, the claim of a \"traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees\" is misleading. The requirement of 60 votes for confirmation is not universal or traditional, and the Senate has confirmed nominees with fewer than 60 votes in the past.

This discrepancy alone indicates that Coburn's statement is exaggerated.\n\nSecondly, the data provided also shows that murders actually went up between 2008 and 2011, contrary to what Coburn said.

According to the article, in some counties, more machines were allocated to Republican primary voters than to Democrats, leading to longer lines for Democratic voters. This discrepancy in machine allocation may have contributed to the longer wait times experienced by Democratic voters.\n\nThe evidence suggests that there were differences in the way voting machines were allocated in different counties, with some counties placing more machines at polling places in areas with a higher percentage of Republican voters. In Travis County, for example, Democrats and Republicans could vote using the same machines at any polling place, which may have contributed to shorter lines for Democratic voters. However, in other counties, such as Harris and Tarrant, there were staffing disruptions and a lack of operational machines per location, leading to longer wait times for Democratic voters.\n\nIt is worth noting that the article does not provide any information on the exact number of voting machines allocated to each party in each county, or the total number of voters who cast ballots on Super Tuesday. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the longer wait times experienced by Democratic voters. However, based on the evidence provided, it seems likely that the allocation of voting machines played a role in the disparity in wait times between the two parties.\n\nTherefore, we can label this claim as \"Conflicting\", as there is evidence to support both sides of the argument.

The evidence provided supports this claim to some extent, but it also presents conflicting information that challenges the accuracy of this statement.\n\nOn one hand, the article notes that New Jersey had a jobless decade, with more private-sector jobs in New Jersey on January 1, 2000 than were there on December 31, 2009. This suggests that the state did experience a significant loss of private-sector jobs during this time period. Additionally, the governor's comments and those of his spokesperson suggest that the increases in taxes, fees, regulations, and state spending under Democratic leadership contributed to this job loss.\n\nOn the other hand, the article also provides information that challenges the simplicity of this claim. Firstly, the bulk of the private-sector job losses occurred in 2008 and 2009, which were the height of the recession. This suggests that economic factors beyond the control of New Jersey's Democratic leadership may have played a larger role in the job loss. Additionally, the article notes that New Jersey gained 69,300 net jobs in the public-sector during the same time period, which suggests that other factors may have contributed to the state's overall job growth.\n\nFurthermore, the article highlights the complexity of this issue by citing the opinion of Harry Holzer, a professor at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute and the chief economist for the U.S. Department of Labor under President Bill Clinton. He notes that the comparison between 2000 and 2009 is \"extremely unfair\" because the early 2000s were a time of economic prosperity, while the late 2000s were during a recession.

This means that over half of the newly created jobs in Austin did not pay enough for a family to afford a decent standard of living.\n\nThe evidence also shows that the lower-wage jobs accounted for 394 types of positions, including positions in oil, gas, and mining, as well as loan interviewers and clerks, pest control workers, skin-care specialists, and medical secretaries. This suggests that the problem is not limited to a few industries but rather affects a wide range of occupations.\n\nFurthermore, the article notes that the median hourly wage might not be a perfect way to gauge who exactly is earning enough to get by, as some workers in the 57% may have made more than the living wage for a single parent with a child. However, this does not negate the fact that over half of the jobs created in Austin during this period did not pay enough to support a family.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is reasonable to label the claim \"57% of the jobs created in Austin from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage\" as true."

Specifically, the article states that:\n\n1. Protections for people with preexisting conditions predated the ACA by more than a decade through the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in 1996.\n2. HIPAA required insurers to offer coverage to people who exhausted their post-employment COBRA benefits, but it did not address how much insurers could charge for these plans.\n3. The ACA addressed gaps in HIPAA by requiring large employers to provide a minimum package of benefits or face fines and required insurers to sell policies to individuals with preexisting conditions without charging them more.\n4. The article notes that much of HIPAA was written into the health law, making the relationship between the two measures even more complicated.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that while the ACA did provide some protections for people with preexisting conditions, the claim that it granted \"the protection against preexisting condition discrimination that extended to more than 150 million Americans, folks who get their health insurance through their employer\" is an overstatement of the law's provisions.

While Fiorina did say in an interview that she wishes she had moved more quickly in ejecting certain people, the context of this statement is different from the claim made in the attack ad by Barbara Boxer.\n\nThe attack ad claimed that Fiorina said she would have done the layoffs \"faster,\" implying that she was callous and uncaring about the impact on the laid-off workers. However, the evidence provided shows that Fiorina was referring to a select group of high-ranking executives, not the entire 30,000-person layoff. This suggests that the claim in the attack ad was misleading and took Fiorina's comments out of context.\n\nTherefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the evidence does not support the claim made in the attack ad, and it is clear that Fiorina's comments were not intended to be taken as a statement on the layoffs as a whole."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim that there are 500 failing schools in North Carolina is overstated and misleading. While it is true that some North Carolina public schools have received low grades and have not met their growth goals, the term \"failing\" is too broad and does not accurately reflect the complexity of the issue.\n\nFirstly, the definition of \"low-performing\" schools in North Carolina includes both D and F schools, which means that some schools that are not failing according to traditional standards are included in this category. This suggests that the term \"failing\" is not an accurate representation of the schools' performance.\n\nSecondly, the use of a grading scale that gives more weight to raw scores than student growth ignores the progress that students have made and punishes schools for having students who came to them below grade level. As Eric Houck, a former public school teacher and education policy expert at UNC-Chapel Hill, notes, the rubric does not give much weight to how much students improved in a given year, and instead focuses mostly on raw scores. This means that schools are penalized for having students who are still improving, rather than being considered failing.\n\nThirdly, the number of \"failing\" schools is inflated by including schools that are not actually failing, but have not met their growth goals. While it is true that 225 schools did not meet their expected growth in 2014-15, this does not necessarily mean that they are failing schools.\n\nBased on these points, it is appropriate to label the claim that there are 500 failing schools in North Carolina as Conflicting. While some schools may be underperforming, the term \"failing\" is too broad and does not accurately reflect the complexity of the issue. A more nuanced approach is needed to determine which schools are truly struggling and need intervention."

In an interview with Fox after Cruz's statement, Trump clarified that he would not nominate his sister, stating that it would be a conflict of interest. This contradicts the claim made by Cruz.\n\nSecondly, while it is true that Barry wrote the majority opinion in a 2000 panel ruling that found a New Jersey law banning partial-birth abortions to be unconstitutional, there is no evidence to suggest that she is a \"hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge.\" In fact, Trump himself stated in his book The America We Deserve that Barry declined to answer questions about her personal views on abortion at her 1999 Senate confirmation hearing, and the New York Times profile of her in August did not provide any indications of her position on abortion.\n\nLastly, while it is true that current Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative George W. Bush appointee, sided with Barry in the partial-birth abortion case, it is unfair to pin Barry as \"hardcore pro-abortion\" based on this one case alone.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, the claim that Trump has suggested his sister as a potential nominee and that she is a hardcore pro-abortion liberal judge is incorrect. Trump himself has clarified that he was joking when he mentioned his sister, and there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that Barry holds strong pro-abortion views.

Firstly, it quotes Jack Flanagan, a Republican state representative and U.S. House candidate, who explained his vote to continue the state's expanded Medicaid program by stating that \"there was a significant number of people\" in the second congressional district relying on the program. The article then provides data from the state's Health and Human Services department, which shows that Coos County has the highest participation rate in the expanded Medicaid program at 5.38%, followed by Sullivan County with 4.28%.

However, the report states that these estimates were projections rather than promises, and included heavy disclaimers regarding margins of error and uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it can be argued that Romney's statement about President Obama's promise to keep unemployment below 8% is incorrect.

In contrast, the next top 12 spending nations had a combined total of $670.9 billion. These figures demonstrate that the United States has significantly more military spending than any other country, making Booker's claim accurate.\n\nFurthermore, Michael O'Hanlon, a defense expert at the Brookings Institution, explains in an email that the United States' large military budget is due to its global interests and commitments. This suggests that the United States needs to maintain a strong military to protect its overseas interests, which supports Booker's claim that the country can secure and protect itself while also being responsible in its defense spending.\n\nIn conclusion, based solely on the evidence provided in the article, Mayor Booker's claim is accurate, and therefore the label \"True\" is appropriate."

    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for Woodrow Wilson's claim that the United States is still paying interest on the debt from World War I because the evidence presented in the article contradicts his statement. While it is true that the US government borrowed a significant amount of money to finance its operations during World War I, including $30 billion in 1917, the evidence shows that this debt has been rolled over and repaid over time.\n\nFirstly, the article states that the initial debt issued to pay for the war no longer exists, but rather it has been \"rolled over.\" This means that the Treasury sells new bonds to pay off the old bonds that are maturing, effectively replacing the original debt with new debt. As Hooks, an economist at Washington & Lee University, explains, \"in that sense, you could say the debt is still out there.\" However, it would be difficult to assign any specific current bond to that historical incident.\n\nSecondly, the article quotes several experts who are skeptical of Napolitano's characterization of rolled-over debt as being \"not paid back.\" Neil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor, states that rolling over debt means that federal elected officials have decided to borrow money to finance other priorities rather than increase taxes. All well-run businesses do this, he says. This suggests that the US government's decision to roll over its debt is not indicative of failing to pay back the original debt.\n\nFinally, the article mentions that there are still eight Liberty Bonds and two Victory Notes that haven't yet been redeemed, but these financial instruments have been mature since 1947, so they haven't earned any interest for almost 70 years. This suggests that the original debt has been paid off and is no longer an ongoing concern.\n\nBased on the evidence presented in the article, it can be concluded that Woodrow Wilson's claim that the US is still paying interest on the debt from World War I is incorrect. While some of the debt from the war has been rolled over and repaid over time, the original debt has been paid off and is no longer an ongoing concern. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim."

The source of the evidence is a survey conducted by Shorr Packaging Corp., an Aurora, Ill.-based distributor of packaging products, equipment, and services, in collaboration with marketing and analytics agency Garrison Olson.\n\nThe survey found that nearly 1 in 4 online shoppers surveyed (24%) had personally experienced package theft, which is a decrease compared to the 31% of self-reported package theft victims in their 2017 Package Theft report. This suggests that the number of people having packages stolen from their residences may be decreasing. However, the survey also found that more than half those surveyed had taken some sort of precautions to prevent package theft, such as scheduling a delivery and relying on home security tools.\n\nAdditionally, two other sources, both of which are similar surveys, bolster Hutton's claim. Security.org surveyed 1,011 shoppers in mid-2019 about package delivery and found close to 40% of people have been the victims of so-called porch pirates, who snatch package deliveries from porches, stoops, and doorsteps. Meanwhile, home security company Canary said in its November 2019 \"Porch Pirates Beware! Report\" that nearly 1 in 5 Americans were a victim, or know someone who was a victim, of porch pirate thefts during the 2018 holiday season.\n\nThe evidence provided suggests that while package theft is still a significant problem, it is not as prevalent as initially claimed by Hutton. However, given the lack of definitive data on package theft from federal sources, the actual number may be higher than what is reported in these surveys. Therefore, the label True is appropriate based on the evidence provided."

The article explains that during Sink's term as CFO, the state Legislature was responsible for appropriating money for projects, and the Cabinet, including the CFO, signed off on the Division of Bond Finance's bond issues after the Legislature appropriated money for projects. Additionally, the article notes that the entire U.S. economy suffered during Sink's term as CFO, and Florida's trends of increasing debt are consistent with the nation's. These points suggest that while Sink may have played a role in increasing Florida's debt, it is not accurate to place sole blame on her.\n\nThe article also highlights several points that contradict the claim:\n\n1. The CFO does not have veto power over bond appropriations, so Sink could not \"vote down\" the Legislature's bond appropriations.\n2. The entire U.S. economy suffered during Sink's term as CFO, which means that Florida's increasing debt is not unique to Sink's tenure.\n3. The state Legislature is responsible for appropriating money for projects, and the Cabinet, including the CFO, signs off on bond issues after the Legislature appropriates money for projects.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that the claim that Alex Sink supported a $5.2 billion increase in Florida's debt is an oversimplification of the complex financial dynamics at play during her term as CFO.

Additionally, the article notes that anyone charged for using 400 cubic feet or less would see lower bills under the new rate plan, with the biggest savings going to those who use the least water.\n\nFurthermore, the article acknowledges that the plan raises rates for the other half of households that billed monthly for using 500 cubic feet or more, but notes that these households will still see a decrease in their overall water and wastewater bills.

The article from the New York Times reports that after Maine passed a ballot initiative in 2016 to increase the minimum wage for tipped workers, restaurant workers organized campaigns to restore the lower wage for tipped workers due to fears that a higher wage would give patrons less incentive to leave tips. In response, the Maine legislature passed a new law in June 2017 making the minimum wage for tipped workers half of the regular minimum wage. This shows that restaurant employees did organize against the measure and led to a reversal of the decision to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers in Maine.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article supports this claim. Joshua Chaisson, a server in Portland, Maine, co-founded Restaurant Workers of America to oppose the wage increase and argued that individuals were coming into restaurants and asking servers if they still deserved the same tip percentage after the wage increase. Hundreds of restaurant owners and workers showed up at the state capitol in Maine for a public hearing on the wage increase, with some bringing pay stubs to demonstrate their loss of money due to the wage increase. Sen. Roger Katz gave credit to restaurant workers for the new law, stating that they had spoken and the legislature had listened.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that restaurant employees in Maine organized against the measure to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers and led to a reversal of the decision.

Additionally, the budget board staff estimated a total for border spending in all parts of DPS's budget of $331.2 million in the 2014-15 budget, which suggests an increase of $118.3 million over the agency's revised 2012-13 budget total of $212.9 million.\n\nFurthermore, the article states that Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, confirmed that according to Senate Finance Committee staff, border operations spending across all agencies in 2014-15 was $343.2 million, up $121.6 million from the previous budget.

The article cites data from the Police Department, which states that out of the 551 cars stolen so far this year, 460 of them had keys either in the ignition or elsewhere in the vehicle, which accounts for an alarming 83.4 percent of total thefts. This suggests that a significant proportion of auto thefts in St. Petersburg are indeed caused by people leaving their keys in the car, thereby providing evidence to support the claim.\nMoreover, the article quotes Police Chief Chuck Harmon as saying that over the past decade, there has been a 70 percent drop in auto thefts in St. Petersburg due to advances in car technology, which have made vehicles harder to steal with screwdrivers and other tools. However, this has led to an increase in crimes of opportunity, such as thefts caused by people leaving their keys in their cars. The article notes that 96 percent of stolen cars are recovered later where the thief ran out of gas, indicating that most area offenders are not trying to bring cars to chop shops or resell high-end models, but rather capitalizing on careless driver mistakes.\nFinally, the article highlights that it is technically illegal to leave one's car unattended and running, which further underscores the importance of locking one's cars and avoiding such careless mistakes.\nBased on these points, it is clear that the claim \"\"Sixty percent of the auto thefts that we have in (St. Petersburg) are caused by people leaving their keys in the car\"\" is well-supported by the evidence provided in the article.

According to the Congressional Research Service, members of Congress receive an automatic pay increase each year based on private-sector wage changes unless denied by a congressional statute. Blunt voted against measures to stop these automatic pay increases, which resulted in his pay increasing along with other members of Congress.\n\nThe evidence provided shows that Blunt voted in favor of the 1997 Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill, which included an automatic pay increase for members of Congress. This vote was taken before Blunt had been in Congress for five consecutive years, during which time the previous Congress had voted to not adjust their pay. Blunt also voted against measures to stop the yearly pay adjustment from occurring in 1999 through 2007, resulting in his pay increasing each year along with other members of Congress. In 2010, Blunt voted in favor of a bill that froze the pay of some federal civilian employees for two years, which could be seen as a vote to protect Congressional pay increases.\n\nWhile Blunt did not directly vote to increase his own pay 12 times, his votes against measures to stop the automatic pay increases contributed to his pay increasing each year during his time in Congress.

According to the New Jersey Education Department, the number of teachers fell by about 4,500 between 2007 and 2010, which is less than half of the claimed amount. Moreover, Steve Wollmer, director of communications for the New Jersey Education Association, clarified that the term \"firing\" is inaccurate, as layoffs and retirements due to budget cuts were more common than firings. Gordon MacInnes, a former Democratic lawmaker, also highlighted that two factors contributed to the reduction in teachers: Christie's proposed deep reductions in aid, which led to local school boards attempting to fill the gap with property tax hikes that were rejected by voters, and the loss of stimulus dollars. Bruce Baker, a professor of education at Rutgers, agreed that funding cuts led to staffing reductions but emphasized the difficulty in determining the share of reductions due to \"reduction in force\" policies invoked by local public school districts claiming fiscal stress.

While it is true that not all of the migrants arriving in Europe were from Syria, the evidence provided does not support the specific claim made by Governor Huckabee.\n\nFirstly, the article notes that the four out of five non-Syrian migrants are not falsely claiming to be Syrian, which undermines Huckabee's phrasing and suggests that his extrapolation is even more flawed. The refugees in Eurostat's tally hail from other countries experiencing or recovering from conflict, like Afghanistan, Albania, Iraq, and Kosovo.\n\nSecondly, the 44,000 figure provided only represents a three-month period, which is \"particularly problematic\" as the largest spike in Syrian arrivals occurred after June, according to the Guardian. If we look at all of 2015, Syrian refugees account for 52 percent of nearly 800,000 Mediterranean sea arrivals, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Afghanistan and Iraq were the next two top countries of origin of refugees, accounting for 19 percent and 6 percent of refugees respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that not all of the migrants arriving in Europe were from Syria, Governor Huckabee's claim that only one out of five was actually Syrian is misleading and based on incomplete data. A more accurate representation of the situation would be that a significant portion of the refugees arriving in Europe are indeed from Syria, but not to the extent suggested by Huckabee's claim."

    "justification": "The claim made by Leticia Van de Putte that only about 250 Texans have been killed in action since 9/11 is false. The evidence provided in the article supports the opposite conclusion: 588 Texans have been killed in action since Oct. 1, 2011, which is more than twice the number claimed by Van de Putte.\n\nThe article cites data from the Defense Manpower Data Center, which is the Department of Defense's \"human resource information source.\" This data indicates that 310 of the Texans killed in action were married, while 253 were not married; 24 were divorced; and one had an unknown marital status. The article also notes that Van de Putte clarified her initial statement by saying \"So we\u2019re talking probably about 250 folks who would even qualify for this,\" which suggests that she may have been referring to a smaller number than the actual total.\n\nHowever, despite these errors, the evidence provided in the article confirms that a significantly larger number of Texans have been killed in action since 9/11 than the 250 claimed by Van de Putte. The government counts indicate that 411 Texans were killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom (which ran through August 2010), 170 in Operation Enduring Freedom (occurring in Afghanistan and other countries), and seven in Operation New Dawn (in Iraq and nearby countries since Sept. 1, 2010). Based on these numbers, the total number of Texans killed in action since 9/11 is at least 588, which is more than twice the number claimed by Van de Putte.\n\nTherefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate for Leticia Van de Putte's claim that only about 250 Texans have been killed in action since 9/11."

    "justification": "The claim that President Barack Obama \"added\" $6.5 trillion to the national debt in his first term is incorrect and misleading. While it is true that the national debt increased during Obama's presidency, the amount added was not greater than the level on the day he took office.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article supports this conclusion. According to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, the estimated amount of debt held by the public at the end of fiscal year 2013 was $12.636 trillion. Based on this estimate, the amount of debt held by the public added during Obama's tenure would be about $6.329 trillion, surpassing the amount as of his inauguration by about $22 billion. However, this figure does not represent the total debt, which is estimated to increase to $17.5 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2013.\n\nIt is important to note that both Presidents Bush and Obama have contributed to the debt increases over the last decade through tax cuts, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, stimulus bills, and other spending initiatives. Therefore, it is not accurate to blame Obama alone for the increased national debt during his presidency.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim. The claim suggests that President Obama added a large amount of debt to the national economy, but the evidence shows that while the debt did increase during his presidency, it was not greater than the level on the day he took office."

The article also notes that there are three Hispanic Republican senators and seven Hispanic Republicans in the House, which further undermines the claim of an all-white and all-Christian party.\n\nSecondly, the article highlights that the definition of \"all white\" is not clear-cut, as it depends on how one defines race and ethnicity. The Census Bureau does not include Hispanic or Latino as a racial designation, instead using categories such as white, black, Asian, Pacific Islander, and American Indian. This shows that the label of \"white\" is not fixed and can be nuanced.\n\nLastly, the article mentions that there are potential non-white, non-Christian Republicans who could take seats in Congress in the near future, such as Mia Love, a Republican African-American running for Congress in Utah, and Will Hurd, an African-American Republican running in Texas' most competitive House district. This contradicts the idea that there are no other non-white Republicans in Congress.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that \"There are now all Christian and all white Republicans except for one black senator appointed\" is Conflicting, as it does not accurately reflect the diversity of beliefs and identities within the Republican party in Congress."

The bond legislation passed in 1997, with Kyrillos voting in favor of it, authorized the state's Economic Development Authority to sell $2.75 billion in bonds, which were deposited into state retirement funds for public workers. A separate companion bill changed accounting rules for the pension system and allowed the state and local employers to reduce their normal contributions by the amount of surplus in the funds. This move allowed the state to avoid making nearly $600 million in payments into the pension system that year, which helped balance the budget.\n\nThe article states that the bonds will cost $10.1 billion to pay off, with the general fund shouldering the burden of the bond payments, not the pension system. The average rate of return on the investment has been 6.36 percent a year, according to the state Treasury Department.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is clear that the claim that Joe Kyrillos \"voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion\" is False. The bond legislation did not constitute a raid on the pension system, and the bonds have not resulted in a cost of nearly $15 billion to pay off as Menendez claimed."

    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided, it is clear that President Obama was correct when he said that \"a million people\" in Texas could get health insurance immediately if the state expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. The Urban Institute estimates that almost 1.4 million Texans would become eligible for Medicaid if the state opted to expand, and the state agency report suggests that under both scenarios (with and without Medicaid expansion), a significant number of uninsured Texans would gain coverage. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim.\n\nThe evidence provided supports the idea that a significant number of people in Texas are currently uninsured, and that expanding Medicaid under Obamacare could provide them with access to health insurance. President Obama's statement reflects this reality, as he is citing the potential for millions of Texans to gain coverage immediately if the state chose to accept the federal dollars available for expansion.\n\nFurthermore, the estimate of 1.7 million newly eligible uninsured adults living in Texas alone supports the claim that a million people could get health insurance right away. This number represents a significant portion of the total uninsured population in Texas and highlights the potential impact of Medicaid expansion on improving access to healthcare for low-income individuals and families.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that President Obama's claim that \"a million people\" in Texas could get health insurance immediately if the state expanded Medicaid under Obamacare is accurate. The available data supports this claim, and it is reasonable to assume that a significant number of uninsured Texans would gain coverage if the state chose to expand Medicaid. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim."

The article cites data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics which shows that in June 2012, New Jersey added 9,900 jobs overall, including private-sector and public-sector employment. When adding this to the jobs gained since the beginning of the year, the total number of jobs created in 2012 so far is 39,600. This is compared to last year when the state gained 31,100 jobs. Therefore, the first six months of job gains in 2012 have already outpaced job growth in 2011 by 8,500 jobs.\n\nFurthermore, the article also states that 2011 was the best single year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000. According to the data provided, New Jersey added 33,400 private-sector jobs in 2011, which is the most since 2000 when the state added 64,500 private-sector jobs. This further supports Governor Christie's claim that 2011 was the best year for private-sector job growth since 2000.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label the claim made by Governor Chris Christie as True.

    "justification": "The claim that \"Says when armed civilians stop mass shootings with guns, an average of 2.5 people die; otherwise, an average of 18 people die\" is False.\n\nThe supporting article text provides evidence that challenges the accuracy of this claim. Firstly, the study by Dr. Pete Blair and his colleagues found that the median number of people shot in active shooter incidents is five (excluding the perpetrator), which is much lower than the 18 people claimed by Rubens. Secondly, Blair's research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun, and the most common method of stopping the attack was tackling the attacker rather than using firearms. Finally, Blair emphasized that it would be difficult to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of armed civilians in stopping active shooter events based on the limited data that exists.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence provided in the supporting article text undermines the claim that armed civilians can significantly reduce the number of people killed in mass shootings. While it is possible that an armed civilian may occasionally stop a mass shooting, the available data suggests that this is unlikely to be a significant factor in reducing casualties. Therefore, the label False is appropriate for this claim."

While there are some ambiguities in the case of one of his clients, Kaboni Savage, who received a federal death sentence in 2013, El-Shabazz himself acknowledges that he did not represent Savage in the federal case for which he received the death penalty. Therefore, none of his clients have ever been sentenced to death while under his representation.\n\nThe article cites two legal experts, Claire Finkelstein and Jules Epstein, who support this conclusion. Finkelstein argues that El-Shabazz is trying to prove himself as a good lawyer by making the statement, and given the context, it is not incorrect. Epstein adds that the fact that a former client received the death penalty with a different attorney does not reflect on El-Shabazz's abilities as a lawyer.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article also supports the accuracy of El-Shabazz's statement. Anthony Brown, one of El-Shabazz's clients, was given a life sentence rather than death row, and there is no record of anyone with the name Anthony Brown having received a death sentence in Pennsylvania. Moreover, the article notes that another client of El-Shabazz', Kaboni Savage, received a federal death sentence in 2013, but El-Shabazz himself acknowledges that he did not represent Savage in the federal case for which he received the death penalty.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, Tariq El-Shabazz's claim that none of his clients have ever been sentenced to death is supported by the information in the article."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim being evaluated because the evidence presented does not provide clear support for the ad's assertions. While the report prepared before Obama took office did feature projections for the effect of a stimulus plan, including a projected jobless rate around 5.6 percent in mid-2012, the caveats and uncertainties surrounding these estimates are not adequately addressed by the ad.\n\nFirstly, the report was labeled as a \"projection\" rather than a \"promise,\" indicating that it was not a formal commitment made by President Obama. Secondly, the ad selectively quotes from Obama's speech introducing the report, taking out of context statements that do not necessarily support the claim being made. For instance, while Obama does say \"we'll create jobs,\" he also explicitly states that the projections are subject to margins of error and considerable uncertainty.\n\nFurthermore, the ad ignores the fact that the report was prepared before Congress had written a stimulus plan, and therefore any jobless rate projections were based on hypothetical scenarios rather than an actual policy implemented by President Obama. This context is crucial in evaluating the accuracy of the claim being made.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be some correlation between the evidence provided and the claim being made, the ad's assertions are not supported by a thorough analysis of the evidence.

Ernst's comparison of strong economic policy in Iowa versus national stagnation is flawed as she compares two different statistics and different time periods.\n\nThe evidence provided in the article supports the label \"Conflicting\" for the following reasons:\n\n1. Personal income growth in Iowa has been faster than the national average over the past eight years, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. However, this growth is relatively short-term and noisy, as shown by the fluctuations in personal income growth in the previous quarters.\n2. The real wage growth in Iowa has been relatively flat during the same period, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This suggests that while personal income may be growing faster in Iowa, the real wages have not kept pace with inflation.\n3. Ernst's comparison of strong economic policy in Iowa versus national stagnation is misleading as she compares two different statistics and different time periods. Real wages are a component of personal income but are derived from separate data sources and use very different methodologies, making direct comparisons difficult.\n4. The article highlights the limitations of comparing short-term growth patterns and notes that real wages have grown faster in Iowa over the past eight years than nationally. However, this growth is still relatively flat compared to the previous periods.\n\nIn conclusion, while Braley's claim about personal income growth in Iowa is partially accurate, it is misleading to compare this growth to national stagnation without considering the different time periods and statistics used.

Today, that same worker would earn less than the poverty line for a family of two\" is true.\n\nThe article provides a graph that shows the minimum wage over the years against household poverty levels. In 1968, the minimum wage was $1.60 an hour, and an employee working full-time would have earned $3,328 annually, which was above the poverty thresholds for a three-person household. However, there was a dual minimum wage system in place at that time, where certain groups of employees, such as those working in schools, public hospitals, laundries, hotels, and motels, were paid as little as $1.15 an hour. These employees, working full-time every week of the year, would have earned $2,392 annually and fallen below the poverty line for a three-person household.\n\nFast forwarding to modern times, the article states that the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour was established in 2009, and a full-time minimum wage earner makes $15,080 a year. This is slightly below the average 2013 poverty threshold for a family of two, which is $15,156.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the claim made in the article is true.

    "justification": "The claim \"Technology coming to Virginia allows COVID-19 personal protection equipment to be 'decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading performance'\" is labeled as \"Conflicting\" due to the inconsistencies in the provided evidence. While the Battelle Memorial Institute's decontamination system has been shown to effectively sanitize N95 masks up to 20 times, there are several reasons why reusing them beyond that limit may not be practical or effective.\n\nFirstly, research on how effective this type of decontamination is is limited, and the long-term effects on the masks' filtration quality are not well understood. N95Decon, a research collaborative, has found that hydrogen peroxide appears to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask's filtration, but the impact of repeated decontamination cycles on mask integrity is still being studied.\n\nSecondly, even if the decontamination process itself does not significantly affect the mask's fit quality, reusing the masks multiple times can lead to a decline in fit quality due to loss of shape. This is according to an N95Decon report on hydrogen peroxide, which found that fit quality declined substantially after five uses and even more so after 15 wears.\n\nThirdly, the process of decontamination requires hospitals to have other protocols in place, such as safely collecting used masks and having a plan to move them to and from the sanitization facility. This adds complexity to an already challenging situation.\n\nIn light of these factors, while Battelle's technology can help with decontamination, it is important to recognize that reusing N95 masks beyond 20 times may not be the most effective or practical solution. As PolitiFact National noted in their fact-check, government authorities and healthcare researchers are clear that this is a crisis measure and should not be seen as a substitute for ordering new masks.\n\nTherefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim, as the evidence suggests that while decontamination technology can help with the reuse of N95 masks, there are limitations to how many times they can be safely reused without compromising their effectiveness or integrity."

The article states that the House bill increases the ratio up to five times starting in 2018, unless states set a different age ratio, which would result in older adults paying more than current law.\n\nThe article provides several pieces of evidence to support this claim:\n\n1. The provision jumped out right away: Insurance companies could charge five times more for those ages 50-64 buying insurance on the individual market.\n2. Under current law, insurers can charge older people more than younger adults - three times as much.\n3. The article states that the lower 3-to-1 age ratio in the ACA was a better deal for older adults, as it more accurately reflects the actual higher costs spent for older adults' health care.\n4. The Rand Corporation estimated that the change in age ratios in the House bill would result in older Americans paying more than current law.\n5. The article concludes that the legislation would disproportionately increase the number of uninsured ages 50-64 with incomes less than 200 percent of the poverty limit.\n\nBased on these pieces of evidence, it can be justified that the claim is correct and that Rep.

This means that the numbers provided are not entirely accurate, leading to an uncertain estimate.\n\nSecondly, as criminologist James Alan Fox pointed out, a jump of 40 percent in just two years is an enormous increase that would undoubtedly have an impact on crime statistics generally. However, this has not been observed in the available data.\n\nThirdly, there is no universal definition of who counts as a gang member, which can lead to inconsistent reporting and difficulty in accurately quantifying the number of gang members.\n\nFinally, local law enforcement officials may have an interest in overstating the number of gang members in their jurisdiction, which could bias the data.\n\nIn light of these concerns and issues of uncertainty, it is reasonable to label Newt Gingrich's claim as \"Conflicting,\" indicating that while there is some evidence to support his statement, there are also significant limitations and potential biases that affect its accuracy."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is an appropriate label for the claim that Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt is unsustainable and caused by the greed of Wall Street vulture funds, based on the evidence provided. Here's why:\n\n1. The article acknowledges that Puerto Rico has been accumulating debt for decades, long before Wall Street got involved. This suggests that the island's debt problem is not solely caused by outside actors, but rather a combination of factors including local mismanagement and economic decline. (Paragraph 3)\n2. The article mentions that hedge funds and other non-traditional buyers \"eyeing fat yields and possible trading gains\" purchased $3.5 billion worth of junk bonds at a tax-free interest rate of just under 9 percent, which helped Puerto Rico dig itself into a bigger hole. This suggests that while Wall Street has certainly profited off of the situation, it is not the sole cause of Puerto Rico's debt problem. (Paragraph 7)\n3. The article highlights that Puerto Rico was already knee-deep in debt by the time the financial industry got involved, and that the island was already experiencing economic depression and population decline before Wall Street got involved. This suggests that the island's debt problem is not solely caused by outside actors, but rather a combination of factors including local mismanagement and economic decline. (Paragraph 4)\n4. The article notes that while Wall Street should be held accountable for its opportunism, the exact figure of fees received by banks like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and UBS for managing Puerto Rico's bond sales is $1.4 billion for $61 billion worth of bond sales since 2006, which is a relatively modest role in creating the need for a comprehensive debt solution. (Paragraph 8)\n\nBased on these points, it can be argued that while Wall Street has certainly profited off of Puerto Rico's debt crisis, the island's debt problem is not solely caused by outside actors and is instead the result of a combination of factors including local mismanagement and economic decline. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim."

However, in recent months, Crist has attacked Marco Rubio for holding similar positions that he himself held just six months ago. This inconsistency between Crist's past and present statements supports the label \"Conflicting.\"\n\nThe evidence provided in the article highlights several instances where Crist has changed his position on certain issues, including abortion, stem cell research, and Social Security. For example, in 1998, Crist stated that he was pro-choice but not pro-abortion, while in 2010, he vetoed state budget language banning tax dollars from being used to support human embryonic stem cell research. Similarly, during the 2010 Republican U.S. Senate primary, Crist said he would support \"pro-life\" legislation like tax credits and subsidies for parents who adopt, despite not answering questions about Roe v.

These inconsistencies in Crist's position demonstrate that he has changed his views over time, supporting the label \"Conflicting.\"\n\nAdditionally, when Marco Rubio attacked Crist for holding positions that are contradictory to those he held just six months ago, it is clear that Crist is being inconsistent in his political stances.

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim that Mitch McConnell voted \"three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas\" is misleading because it implies that these tax breaks specifically incentivized companies to move jobs out of the country, when in fact they did not. The evidence provided shows that the votes McConnell cast were on legislation that sought to close already-existing corporate tax deductions, rather than create new incentives for outsourcing. These deductions did not pertain to outsourcing specifically because under current law, there is no special provision that gives corporations a deduction or any kind of tax break for moving employees out of the country.\n\nThe claim is also simplistic and misleading because it ignores the context of the votes McConnell cast. The legislation he opposed was not aimed at creating incentives for outsourcing, but rather at stopping existing deductions that benefited all businesses, both those that insource and those that outsource. The amount of money associated with these standard deductions is minuscule compared to corporate tax revenue overall, and eliminating them would not have a significant impact on companies' decision-making regarding outsourcing.\n\nTherefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the claim does not accurately reflect the context of the votes McConnell cast or the content of the legislation he opposed. While it is true that McConnell voted against measures that could have resulted in a small amount of lost revenue for companies that outsource, this does not mean that he voted to send jobs overseas. In fact, the evidence suggests that these votes were primarily focused on closing existing loopholes and deductions, rather than creating new incentives for outsourcing."

    "claim": "Says a portfolio managed by the Texas General Land Office earned 22 percent last year while the state\u2019s emergency reserve account experienced a 1 percent gain.",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, the label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim that the portfolio managed by the Texas General Land Office earned 22 percent last year while the state\u2019s emergency reserve account experienced a 1 percent gain. Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. The article cites a letter written by Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, in which he compares the earnings of the portion of the Permanent School Fund managed by the land office to the earnings on the state\u2019s savings account, otherwise known as the Economic Stabilization Fund. According to Patterson, the GLO-managed PSF earned 22 percent last year, while the rainy day fund earned only 1 percent. This comparison suggests that the portfolio managed by the land office outperformed the state\u2019s emergency reserve account.\n2. The article provides an agency report to the Legislature stating that through March 2012, the market value of the agency\u2019s investments made from the Permanent School Fund was $3.077 billion, with nearly half of that reflecting \"externally managed direct real estate investments\" and nearly $1.2 billion \"attributable to short-term investments\" in the state\u2019s treasury. The report shows that gross time-weighted returns on the portfolio in the 12 months through March amounted to nearly 23 percent, which is higher than the 1 percent gain experienced by the emergency reserve account.\n3. The article also provides information on the earnings of the real estate investments through March 2012, which generated nearly 14 percent in market value in the 12 months through March 2011, but lost about 15 percent in the 12 months through March 2010. This suggests that the real estate investments have been consistently generating returns, although they may not always be positive.\n4. The article quotes Patterson as saying that he does not count the cash-on-call funds as part of the investment portfolio, which supports the conclusion that the earnings on the real estate investments are higher than the earnings on the cash-on-call funds.\n\nBased on these points, it can be concluded that the claim is true and that the portfolio managed by the Texas General Land Office did indeed earn 22 percent last year while the state\u2019s emergency reserve account experienced a 1 percent gain."

    "justification": "The claim made by Nicholas Brandes that he is being paid $53 per day to educate children is False. PolitiFact's investigation found that his salary information from the public school system in Stokes County shows that his annual salary is $44,472 before taxes, health insurance, and childcare costs are taken out. This is lower than the most recent median income calculated for Stokes County and all North Carolina residents. Additionally, PolitiFact's calculation of Brandes' monthly paycheck shows that he takes home around $2,752 per month, which works out to $688 per week and $137 per day. This is significantly less than the $53 per day figure he claimed on Facebook. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that Brandes' claim of being paid $53 per day to educate children is exaggerated and False."

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The label \"True\" is appropriate for the statement \"\"We see a quarter-billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion.\"\" based on the following reasons:\n\nFirstly, the evidence provided in the article supports the claim. According to the latest actuary report released in January 2014, the Providence pension fund had $336 million in assets as of June 30, 2013, which is significantly lower than the $1.2 billion needed to cover its current and future pension obligations. This means that the claim is accurate in terms of the funding shortfall faced by the pension system.\n\nSecondly, the article provides a detailed explanation of why up-to-date data on the city's pension obligations were not available at the time the statement was made. The city was withholding this information as part of an ongoing dispute with its actuary, Buck Consultants, which suggests that the delay in providing accurate data was not due to any intentional misrepresentation by the mayor or his predecessor.\n\nFinally, the article includes a defense of Harrop's figures, stating that he cited two blog postings from reporter Ted Nesi of WPRI.com, which provided the necessary information at the time the statement was made. This suggests that Harrop's figures were based on reliable sources and were not simply pulled out of thin air.\n\nBased on these factors, it can be concluded that the claim \"\"We see a quarter-billion dollars in a pension fund that needs to be funded at $1.2 billion.\"\" is accurate and deserves the label \"True\"."

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The claim that Donald Trump was \"forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times\" is supported by the evidence provided. According to the article, Trump's businesses have filed for Chapter 11 reorganization four times: in 1991 for the Trump Taj Mahal casino, in 1992 for the Trump Plaza Hotel, in 2004 for Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, and in 2009 for Trump Entertainment Resorts.\n\nThe evidence provided suggests that Trump's businesses filed for bankruptcy as a result of financial difficulties, rather than as a result of poor decision-making or unethical behavior. For example, the article states that the Trump Taj Mahal casino accumulated $3 billion in debt by 1991, and that Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts missed a $53.1 million bond interest payment in 2008. These financial problems were likely beyond Trump's control, and filing for bankruptcy was a way to restructure the companies' debt and avoid liquidation.\n\nFurthermore, the article quotes experts who argue that filing for bankruptcy is a common business decision that can be a sound choice when a company is facing serious financial problems. For example, Michael Venditto, a partner at the ReedSmith law firm, states that bankruptcy can be a \"sound business decision\" when the company is facing serious financial problems, and that it's better than the business shutting down completely.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label Donald Trump as having filed for bankruptcy four times. The label accurately reflects the information presented in the article, and does not make any unfair or unsubstantiated claims about Trump's business practices."

    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "Based on the evidence provided in the article, it is appropriate to label Harry Reid's claim that Mitt Romney did not pay taxes for 10 years as False. The article provides several reasons why this claim is unlikely to be true:\n\nFirstly, according to an IRS study of nearly 4 million 2009 tax returns of filers reporting more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, only 0.529 percent had no U.S. income tax liability. This suggests that it is unlikely for Romney to have paid zero taxes for an extended period of time.\n\nSecondly, the article notes that Romney's recent income has been substantially higher than $200,000, which means that the size of his deductions and credits would need to be even larger than those of the filers included in the IRS study if his tax liability was going to fall to zero.\n\nThirdly, the article quotes two tax experts who conclude that it is highly unlikely that Romney paid nothing in taxes for 10 years. They note that while it's possible he paid very little in taxes, it's hard to believe he paid none.\n\nFinally, the article mentions that Romney released an estimate of his 2011 taxes, which showed income of $20.9 million and a tax payment of $3.2 million. This suggests that he has been paying taxes in recent years, which further undermines the claim that he did not pay any taxes for 10 years.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is unlikely that Romney did not pay taxes for 10 years, and therefore Harry Reid's claim should be labeled as False."

The article provides specific votes taken by Ayotte in 2015 and 2011, including a bill to block federal funding to Planned Parenthood, an amendment to strip a provision from the bill that would have provided federal funding to Planned Parenthood, and a resolution to prohibit federal dollars from funding Planned Parenthood. While some of these votes were procedural or did not offer a clean up-or-down funding decision, the overall pattern of Ayotte's votes shows consistent opposition to funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is accurate to label Kelly Ayotte as having voted to defund Planned Parenthood six times."

    "taxonomy_label": "interval",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that the young Texas rapper faces the death penalty while the Santa Fe High School shooter faces prison and then parole after 40 years is false. The Supreme Court ruling in Roper vs. Simmons (2005) prohibits the execution of juveniles under the age of 18, making it impossible for the rapper to face the death penalty. According to Section 8.07(c) of Texas' penal code, no person can be punished by death for an offense committed while they were younger than 18 years old. Additionally, legislative action in response to a Supreme Court ruling in Miller v. Alabama (2012) mandated that all juveniles convicted of capital offenses be sentenced to prison for 40 calendar years before qualifying for consideration for parole. However, Texas law solely permits juveniles sentenced to life in prison to apply for parole after 40 years, and does not guarantee automatic parole. Therefore, the rapper cannot face the death penalty and will have to serve at least 40 years in prison before being eligible for parole."

The evidence provided in the article supports the opposite conclusion: that a significant proportion of the groups targeted by the IRS were conservative.\n\nThe article cites a statement from Progress Texas, a Democratic-leaning nonprofit advocacy group, which claimed that two-thirds of the groups scrutinized by the IRS were not conservative. However, the evidence provided in the article contradicts this claim. According to the inspector general's report, 72 of the 298 groups selected for special scrutiny had \"tea party\" in their title, 13 had \"patriot,\" and 11 had \"9/12.\" This adds up to 96 groups, or 32.2% of the total number of groups. The article does not provide information on the political views of the remaining 202 groups, but it is clear that a significant proportion of them were conservative.\n\nFurthermore, the acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller confirmed during Congressional hearings that the criteria used by IRS employees to identify groups for scrutiny included broad descriptions such as \"educating Americans about the Constitution,\" which is a stated goal of the 9/12 Project, an activist organization founded by conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck. This suggests that the IRS was targeting groups with conservative views, rather than non-conservative groups as the claim suggests.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided in the article, it is clear that the claim \"Says two-thirds of groups targeted for IRS scrutiny were not conservative\" is false, and that a significant proportion of the groups targeted by the IRS were conservative."

    "taxonomy_label": "interval",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim made by Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez because the evidence provided supports her claim that 30 percent of the funding from the transportation package is being set aside for non-road projects. According to the governor's budget proposal, local streets and roads would receive $445 million, bridges and culverts would receive $400 million, and congested corridors would receive $250 million, while other categories such as rail, transit, active transportation, parks and recreation, food and agriculture, university research, and workforce development programs would receive a total of $818.7 million, which is about 29 percent of the overall $2.8 billion in new funding from the transportation package.\n\nWhile the governor's staff and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) argue that the budget adheres to the Senate transportation funding bill (SB1) and that the funding package was always intended to include transit and rail, the evidence provided by Assemblywoman Melendez suggests that a significant portion of the funding is being diverted from its intended purpose for non-road projects.\n\nMoreover, the evidence also shows that existing laws require some gas tax revenue to go to state parks and food and agriculture programs, which explains why these categories are receiving a portion of the gas tax money. This further supports Assemblywoman Melendez's claim that the budget is diverting funds from their intended purpose for non-road projects.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that there is a conflict between the governor's budget proposal and Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez's claim regarding the allocation of funding from the transportation package. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim made by Assemblywoman Melendez."

This is significantly lower than the $2,145 cost of tuition, room, and board that year. Therefore, it is plausible that a student working a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay for tuition only, which would be $688 in this case.\n\nThe meme's wording is the only notable failing, as it implies that the student could attend any university of their choice, when in fact the data refers to in-state tuition rates. However, this limitation does not affect the overall accuracy of the claim.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the claim \"In 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year's full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice\" is True."

The evidence comes from a report commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). The report analyzes the economic impact of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry, including job creation and indirect jobs.\n\nThe report breaks down the 141,600 jobs into three categories: direct jobs, indirect jobs, and induced jobs. Direct jobs include 42,638 jobs directly involved in the oil and natural gas industry, such as extraction and production jobs. Indirect jobs include 33,502 workers in outside industries that supply the fields, while induced jobs include 65,490 positions created to meet the demand from the spending of employees in the direct and indirect jobs.\n\nThe report uses commonly accepted input-output models to show the known relationships between industries and takes care not to count jobs twice. The BLS codes also support the assessment that gas station employees are more accurately convenience store retail jobs rather than mining or production jobs expected in oil and gas.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, it is fair to count all of these jobs, as the methodology of the study is sound, and the positions are outside the oil and natural gas industries.

The evidence shows that Hernandez has not restricted the flow of information about inmate-immigrants as intimated by Abbott, and her policy complies with 8 USC 1373.\n\nFirstly, the evidence states that Hernandez's policy does not restrict the flow of information about inmates to or from federal agencies, including ICE. According to Priddy, the Travis County official overseeing the county\u2019s correctional complex, each suspect booked into the jail continues to be fingerprinted, and the identifying characteristics of more than 4.8 million individuals are stored in the Automated Fingerprint Information System. This means that ICE agents can continue to contact the department directly about an inmate, for instance seeking to interview a jailed individual subject to an ongoing investigation.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that Hernandez's policy allows ICE to interview inmates and provides them with information on their requests, just as it does with any other agency. This contradicts Governor Abbott's claim that Hernandez is refusing to enforce 8 USC 1373 by limiting the flow of information about inmate-immigrants.\n\nThirdly, immigration experts consulted in the article agree that Hernandez's policy complies with the intent of 8 USC 1373. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for less immigration, suggests that the sheriff's policy against employees inquiring into immigration status or providing information on a person's release date or address conflicts with the intent of the statute noted by Abbott. However, Lena Graber, an attorney with the San Francisco-based Immigrant Legal Resource Center, argues that the sheriff's policy is limited to limiting detainer requests honored by the department and doesn't extend to restricting information flow, which would conflict with 8 USC 1373.\n\nFinally, the evidence shows that Hernandez revised her policy to clarify that nothing in it prohibits or restricts sending information to or requesting or receiving information from ICE regarding an individual's immigration or citizenship status. This further undermines Governor Abbott's claim that Hernandez is refusing to enforce 8 USC 1373.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that Governor Greg Abbott's claim that Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez is refusing to enforce 8 USC 1373 is False. Hernandez's policy complies with 8 USC 1373 and does not restrict the flow of information about inmate-immigrants as intimated by Governor Abbott."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim made by Donald Trump that Ambassador Christopher Stevens sent 600 requests for help in Benghazi. The evidence provided in the article undermines Trump's statement. Firstly, the Republicans' count of 569 requests accumulated over nine months is significantly lower than the 600 figure cited by Trump. Secondly, Stevens was not yet the ambassador to Libya when the attacks occurred, which means that even if every request had been made by him and went directly to Clinton, the highest number Trump could cite would be around 205, not 600. Thirdly, the count is supposed to be the number of security requests or concerns from Benghazi to the State Department, not from Stevens to Clinton as Trump said. The article notes that it's common for such correspondence to be sent under the name of the ambassador, even if he/she never saw it, to the secretary of state, even though in the vast majority of cases it's handled by lower-level people and the secretary never sees it. Finally, the Washington Post Fact Checker found duplication in the data used by the GOP staff to come up with their total, which may have inflated the total number of requests. Based on these points, it is clear that Trump's claim is exaggerated and misleading, thus justifying the label \"Conflicting\"."
