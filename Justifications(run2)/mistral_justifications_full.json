    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the claim made by Roger Williams and other Republicans stating that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) concluded ObamaCare will cost the U.S. more than 800,000 jobs is not entirely accurate based on the evidence provided in the article.\n\n   While it is true that the CBO did project a small reduction in labor supply due to changes in incentives under Obamacare, this was not equivalent to saying that 800,000 jobs would be lost. The number 800,000 comes from extrapolating half a percent of the workforce, which is an estimate based on assumptions and may not be precise.\n\n   Furthermore, the CBO report also notes that the health care law could actually help economic productivity by improving workers' health status, though the impact might not be substantial or immediate. This suggests that the claim oversimplifies the complexities of the economic effects of Obamacare and presents a potentially misleading picture of its job-related impacts.\n\n   In conclusion, the article demonstrates that the claim about CBO concluding ObamaCare will cost more than 800,000 jobs is open to misinterpretation and oversimplification, which makes it \"Conflicting.\""

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The claim that \"More than 50 percent of immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras use at least one major welfare program once they get here\" can be deemed as true, given the evidence presented in the article. This is because the Center for Immigration Studies fact sheet, a reliable source on immigration issues, states that 57 percent of households headed by immigrants from El Salvador, 54 percent of Honduran households, and 49 percent of Guatemalan immigrant households use at least one major welfare program. These statistics are based on data from the Census Bureau, which defines \"welfare\" programs to include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps (now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP), Medicaid, free and reduced school lunches, Supplementary Security Income (SSI), housing aid, and the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) food assistance program. While not all immigrants may personally use these programs, they are counted if anyone in their household is receiving them. This evidence therefore supports the claim that more than 50 percent of immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras use at least one major welfare program once they get here."

    "justification": "The label \"True\" is appropriate because the article provides ample historical evidence supporting the claim that the Seven Years' War led many countries to near bankruptcy and Britain's need to raise taxes fueled the American desire for independence. In the article, it is mentioned that GOP Representative Kelly Hastings referenced the Seven Years' War in his tweet as a reason for British taxation, which was one of the main causes of the American Revolution. The article further explains that the war was expensive and Britain tried to recover its costs by imposing taxes on the colonies, particularly with the Stamp Act, Townshend Tariffs, and Tea Act, which were seen as unfair because the colonists had no representation in Parliament. This unrepresented taxation is explicitly cited as a primary cause of the Revolutionary War, making the claim \"The Seven Years\u2019 War led to near bankruptcy for many countries; Britain's need to raise taxes fueled the American desire for independence\" accurate."

    "justification": "The claim \"Just on Jan. 1 of this year, there were 40,000 new laws put on the books in one day\" is labeled as False. This assertion is proven incorrect by the evidence provided, which points out that the 40,000 figure came from a press release by the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) referring to the number of bills and resolutions passed into law in 2011, not specifically for the first day of the year. Furthermore, laws do not always take effect at the start of a year. The article also explains that the 40,000 total includes both bills and resolutions, with the latter often having less significance than statutes. Additionally, the number of federal regulations put into effect in a single year ranges from 3,000 to 4,000 according to experts consulted by the article, which is significantly lower than the claimed figure. Lastly, an investigation into the number of federal laws effective on Jan. 1, 2012, revealed no indication that the number is close to 40,000. Therefore, it can be concluded that the claim is False."

The man in the photo, identified as Abdurahman, is a Dutch-Iraqi who lived in Holland for 10 years and fought in Syria and Iraq. The misconception that the image depicted Mohammad Fazl, one of the five Taliban prisoners, seems to have originated from social media posts that erroneously claimed the man was \"Mohammed Fazi, just one of those great terrorists that this administration traded for the deserter.\" This misidentification can be attributed to the image being shared multiple times on Facebook without proper attribution and context."

While it is true that progress has been made, according to hard data from UNESCO, the number of out-of-school children fell by only 40% from 2000-13, and trends since 2010 have shown a rise in the number of out-of-school children.

Local taxes accounted for only 11% of the Newark Public Schools' overall budget, while state aid, grants, and entitlements made up nearly 80%. The reader's inquiry was investigated by PolitiFact New Jersey who confirmed this information. Furthermore, even though Rice acknowledged that the state finances the bulk of the district's budget and meant to reference the dollar amount (about $80 million or more), this still does not support his claim of paying 80% of the school budget from local taxes. Therefore, it is inaccurate for him to assert that Newark pays 80% of the school budget from local property taxes."

    "justification": "Justification: The claim made about the Obama administration insisting that one of the five prisoners was kept at Guantanamo Bay because he posed such a significant risk, and later allowing him to walk free, is conflicting as presented in the supporting article text. The article clearly states that the United States Supreme Court ruled that detainees had the right to challenge the legality of their confinement in 2008, which was followed by the Obama administration's argument that these prisoners were lawful enemy combatants under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). This ruling did not require the administration to prove that a prisoner posed an ongoing risk to national security. While it is mentioned that certain documents released by Wikileaks labeled one of the detainees as \"high risk,\" this was a difference of opinion within the administration and not a formal statement made in court or any other official capacity that the prisoner would be kept at Guantanamo Bay because he posed such a significant risk. Additionally, it is noteworthy that one of the detainees, Khairullah Khairkhwa, was appealing for his release, and the court case focused on proving whether or not he was a lawful enemy combatant rather than discussing potential risks he might pose if released. Therefore, the claim's portrayal of an administration that \"went to court\" to keep a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay because he was such a risk is conflicting with the actual evidence provided in the article."

Instead, the survey was conducted by a small conservative/libertarian medical group named Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), which has approximately 5,000 members compared to the American Medical Association's 224,503 members. The poll was sent via email to 3,700 known physicians on the AAPS email list, with only 1,050 people opening it and 250 responding during a two-day window. Thus, the data used in the claim is not supported by a representative sample of doctors, making the claim misleading."

We exceeded that average just on one day' after a gunman opened fire at a Walmart in the city\" can be verified as true based on the provided evidence.\n\nThe evidence demonstrates that Beto O'Rourke, who was born and raised in El Paso, stated facts about its crime statistics that are supported by data from the city of El Paso's own records. Specifically, he mentioned that over the last 10 years (2008-2018), the average number of murders per year in El Paso was 18. In addition, O'Rourke stated that in some years, such as 1964 and 2010, there were just five murders in the city. These figures are also confirmed by the evidence: in both those years, there were indeed five recorded murders in El Paso.\n\nFinally, O'Rourke claimed that on a particular day (presumably the day of the shooting he was referencing), El Paso exceeded its average number of annual murders for the last 10 years. The evidence confirms that on this day, there were more than 18 murders recorded in El Paso due to the mass shooting at a Walmart.\n\nGiven these facts, it is evident that the claim made by Beto O'Rourke about the crime statistics of his hometown, El Paso, is accurate and consistent with data from official city records, supporting the label \"True\"."

This figure is significantly lower than $2 billion but still exceeds zero, indicating that money was spent on the operation. Furthermore, it is confirmed in the evidence that few American soldiers set foot in Libya during the seven-month campaign, and certainly no fatalities were reported among these soldiers, which means America did not lose a single life in this operation.

According to the article, the number of Kentuckians who received cancellation notices ranges between 130,000 and 168,000, while the number of Kentuckians who have signed up for Obamacare (private insurance on Kynect and Medicaid) is 413,410. This means that at most, the discrepancy between cancellations and enrollments is only twice as big, not 40 times as big as claimed. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that even using the smallest possible number of signups (82,795) for private plans alone, multiplying it by 40 would require over 3.3 million cancellations, which far exceeds the actual number of Kentuckians who had insurance that could be canceled according to a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence provided and can be labeled as False."

The bid money came from the Trump Foundation, which is headed by Donald Trump.

    "justification": "Justification: The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the claim made by Rep. Connie Mack IV that Sen. Bill Nelson \"voted to cut $700 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare\" is factually incorrect, but it does contain an element of truth in its underlying meaning. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) did result in changes aimed at reducing future health care costs in the Medicare program, which was interpreted by Mack as a cut. However, these reductions were not direct cuts to the Medicare budget as claimed but rather came from adjustments to payments to insurance companies and hospitals, and changes in Medicare Advantage plans that were implemented to improve efficiency within the program. The overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future, contrary to Mack's assertion of a cut. Therefore, while there was a connection between the Medicare cost savings and Obamacare, the claim that Nelson \"voted to cut $700 billion out of Medicare\" is misleading because it does not accurately portray the changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act."

The amendment aimed to include exceptions for organs beyond the brain, such as the heart or lungs, in the existing law that already allowed third-trimester abortions under certain conditions, but it did not propose expanding these circumstances. Thus, Branch's amendment did not aim to \"expand\" third-trimester abortions but rather reinforced the intellectual honesty and precision of the existing legislation by acknowledging vital organs other than the brain in a late-term fetus.

The evidence shows that under President Trump, the Mexico City policy applies to \"all assistance for voluntary population planning,\" which includes global health assistance furnished by all departments or agencies, unlike his Republican predecessors who limited it only to family planning programs run by USAID. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the pipeline of family planning and global health programs is more complicated than expected, with various organizations involved, but it is also indicated that global health funding overall is close to $10 billion, which is about 15 times as much money as the United States spends on family planning, the core program affected across all three previous Republican administrations.

While Eric Esshaki's campaign claims that Stevens' health care plan would eliminate these professionals based on a report funded by an organization against Medicare for All, the article states that Stevens has publicly supported a public option rather than Medicare for All at the time the ad was produced, and she does not currently support Medicare for All. Additionally, the report cited by Esshaki's campaign makes problematic assumptions about the impact of Medicare for All on the supply of physicians and nurses, which casts doubt on the validity of their claim regarding job losses in the health care sector.

    "justification": "The claim that \"someone living in El Paso would have to drive 550 miles each way to San Antonio for something as simple as cervical cancer screening\" is labeled as False. This is because the evidence provides detailed information about the availability of healthcare facilities, particularly for cervical cancer screenings, in El Paso itself. The article states that there are two clinics in El Paso that provide such services - Reproductive Services of El Paso and Hill Top Women's Reproductive Clinic. While it is possible that the closure of one clinic (Reproductive Services) could potentially impact the ease of access for some women, it does not necessitate a 550-mile round trip to San Antonio as claimed. Moreover, the article quotes Adriana Valdes, co-director of outreach and case management at the Cancer and Chronic Disease Consortium, who asserted that there are indeed other organizations and institutions in El Paso that can provide these services, thereby contradicting the claim made.

However, it is important to note that the commission's data includes all services provided to these women, not just health screenings as claimed by the legislators.\n\nFurthermore, the commission's data also indicates that many of the clients served by Planned Parenthood may have received their health screenings at a provider other than Planned Parenthood, which would decrease the percentage of women who exclusively receive their health screenings from Planned Parenthood. Without more specific information about where these women actually received their health screenings, it is difficult to determine the exact percentage of clients who received health screenings solely at a Planned Parenthood clinic, and thus the claim made by the legislators may be overstated.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim made by the Democratic legislators implies that nearly 45 percent of the women in the program receive their health screenings exclusively from Planned Parenthood, the available data suggests that this may not be the case and thus, the two sources present conflicting information on the issue."

While there are studies showing a potential positive impact on trade and economic growth, the evidence is not consistent in supporting the claimed ratio of $4 for every dollar invested.\n\nThe study cited by Shenggen Fan, the head of the International Food Policy Research Institute, showed that an investment in agricultural research could generate $4.39 of additional imports, but it did not guarantee that these returns would be captured by the original investor, which is a significant difference from the claim made. Furthermore, the study is 20 years old, and no other subsequent studies seem to have reached the same conclusion.\n\nAdditionally, when analyzing another study from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, it was found that the trade gains were more likely to be around a 1-to-1 ratio, rather than the 4-to-1 claimed in the original statement. The consensus among researchers seems to be that while there may be positive impacts on trade and employment from foreign aid for agricultural research, the exact ratio or causal chain proposed in the claim is a stretch. Therefore, the evidence does not fully support the claim, making it conflicting."

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim \"We have at least 200,000 to 300,000 hate crimes in a given year,\" as evidenced by the article provided. The article presents data from two main programs used for collecting hate crime statistics in the United States: the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR) and the National Crime Victimization Survey.\n\nThe UCR reported 5,796 hate crime incidents for 2012, which is significantly lower than the range claimed by the statement. However, it should be noted that the UCR relies on crimes that are reported to the police, and there are concerns about underreporting due to agency non-participation, especially in areas with high populations of African Americans who are statistically the largest group victimized by hate crimes.\n\nTo account for unreported crimes, the article discusses the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which estimates that 293,800 hate crime victimizations occurred in 2012. This estimate is consistent with the range claimed in the statement, thereby providing support for its accuracy.\n\nIn addition to these quantitative data, the article also presents expert opinions that suggest the FBI reports may underestimate the number of hate crimes due to factors such as underreporting by law enforcement agencies and improper identification of hate crimes by local police officers. Furthermore, it is mentioned that some victims may be reluctant to report incidents to the police, which could contribute to underreporting in the UCR data.\n\nOverall, the evidence presented in the article supports the claim that there are at least 200,000 to 300,000 hate crimes in a given year, as suggested by the NAACP President Cornell William Brooks' statement. The discrepancy between the UCR and NCVS data, along with expert opinions on the underreporting of hate crimes, lend credibility to this claim and justify the label \"True.\""

According to the report, the number of people illegally crossing the Israel-Egypt border was more than 16,000 in 2011 and less than 20 in 2016, representing a 99% decrease. Additionally, it mentions that Johnson's assessment of the cost and timeframe for building the fence are sound as well.

The evidence demonstrates that an advocacy group, Texas Campaign for the Environment (TCE), claims that nearly every city park lacks recycling, with 293 out of 300 parks having no recycling. TCE bases this statement on a city staff presentation to Austin\u2019s Parks and Recreation Board in April 2018, which indicates that the city has 300 parks and mentions the pilot program introducing recycling to only six major parks (Zilker, Town Lake, Walnut Creek, Bull Creek, Ramsay parks, and Walsh Boat Landing). Furthermore, a TCE official confirms the count of parks without recycling, and a city official states that if the department had started its pilot recycling program in 2017 with small neighborhood parks instead of large parks, more parks would have recycling. Additionally, the evidence shows that TCE knows of only one other park with recycling bins, thanks to a neighborhood association. This justifies the label as true because the provided evidence supports the claim that most Austin city parks lack recycling."

A panel with the U.S. International Trade Commission found that Chinese tire imports were threatening American jobs and recommended a three-year tariff. President Obama imposed a lighter tariff, but it was the first time a president approved Section 421 relief on imports from China. The study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that the tariffs saved as many as 1,200 domestic jobs.

The supporting article text shows that North Korea's military ranks fourth in personnel numbers among all countries, with about 1.2 million active-duty personnel (when looking at overall personnel). When considering the population of each country, the Economist placed North Korea as the \"most heavily militarized of all,\" having 49 military personnel for every 1,000 North Koreans. In comparison, China has 1.7 military personnel per 1,000 Chinese and the United States has 5.5 military personnel per 1,000 population. Therefore, it is accurate to say that North Korea has a larger standing army, particularly when considering its population size. While the technology and hardware of North Korean military may not be as advanced, the focus of this claim is on manpower, which North Korea clearly excels in."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim is labeled as False because the evidence provided shows that not only has President Obama recognized law enforcement officers who have fallen in the line of duty with \"special recognition,\" but there are numerous instances where he has done so. These instances include presidential proclamations, memorial services at the U.S. Capitol, and even personal remarks at ceremonies honoring top cops. The evidence also reveals that the number of law enforcement officers who have fallen in the line of duty since President Obama took office is higher than the 794 cited in the claim. Specifically, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, there were 834 deaths between 2009 and Dec. 2, 2014, which is a larger number than 794. Moreover, if we extrapolate the FBI statistics for the years 2009-2013 (521 deaths) and include 2014 (based on a declining trend in deaths), we would still arrive at a smaller number than 794. Therefore, the claim is not only incorrect about the number of officers killed in the line of duty since Obama took office but also wrong to assert that there was \"no special recognition from the White House\" for these fallen officers."

The article points out that the number of jobs in the medical device industry within her congressional district is significantly lower than what she claimed, with estimates ranging from 6,044 to about 10 percent fewer than Blackburn's claim of 10,000. Furthermore, the evidence also indicates a discrepancy in the number of jobs that could potentially be lost due to the tax on medical devices, as different studies and analyses provide conflicting estimates. For example, while one study suggests as many as 146,218 jobs nationwide might be lost, another study commissioned by the medical device industry trade association AdvaMed assumes a much smaller number of jobs would be shipped overseas in response to the tax, suggesting that there might be no incentive to move production out of the country due to the tax applying to all devices, including those made overseas. Thus, Blackburn's claim conflicts with the evidence presented regarding both the number of jobs in her district and the potential impact of the health-care law tax on those jobs."

    "justification": "The label \"True\" is appropriate for the claim that \"Rep. Peter Petrarca voted on two pieces of legislation that helped auto body shops and at that point I think there is a conflict of interest,\" as evidenced by the following:\n\n1. The article clearly states that Rep. Peter Petrarca's father and sister are actively involved in the auto body shop industry, pushing for legislation beneficial to them (the bills in question).\n2. The article also mentions Rep. Peter Petrarca's role as a House senior deputy majority leader, implying that he has some level of influence over legislation.\n3. The article further confirms that Rep. Peter Petrarca did indeed vote in favor of two specific bills (Senate bill 0022 in 2003 and Senate bill 2508 in 2010) that were beneficial to the auto body shop industry, as verified by a check of the House Journal records.\n4. The article quotes Rep. Petrarca's challenger, Gregory J. Costantino, who identifies these bills as clear conflicts of interest due to Peter Petrarca's law firm representing Providence Auto Body and the Auto Body Association of Rhode Island.\n5. In response to these allegations, Rep. Petrarca is unable to refute them, stating that he doesn't know what his opponent was talking about. This lack of knowledge does not negate the fact that he voted for the bills in question.\n6. Despite Petrarca's claims that the bills do not benefit body shops but rather consumers, the benefits of these bills (such as protecting auto body shops from cost penalties when using aftermarket parts and requiring insurance companies to use independent appraisers) would likely indirectly benefit auto body shops by ensuring they receive fair compensation for their services.\n7. Rep. Petrarca's failure to apologize or acknowledge any conflict of interest further supports the claim that there is indeed a conflict of interest in his voting on these bills.\n\nIn summary, the evidence provided demonstrates that Rep. Peter Petrarca did vote on legislation beneficial to the auto body shop industry, his family is involved in this industry, and he has failed to acknowledge any potential conflict of interest.

The evidence explains that if we look at the number of people moving out of poverty from the year each president took office to the year they left office, the ratio is much smaller, with approximately 21 times as many people moving out of poverty during Bill Clinton's presidency compared to Ronald Reagan's. This discrepancy between the two sets of years presented in the claim and evidence challenges the claim that there was a \"100 times\" difference in the number of people moved out of poverty, and thus justifies the label of conflicting."

Although the work on these cars was done in Finland and not with stimulus dollars, the claim that \"the Obama administration spent taxpayer dollars on electric cars in Finland\" is somewhat misleading since it implies that the money came directly from the stimulus bill.\n\nSimilarly, regarding windmills in China, the article does indicate that some components of wind turbines were sourced from China and received funds through the 1603 tax credit program. However, the total amount is relatively small (less than 1%), and it's unclear if this was stimulus money specifically. Furthermore, none of the farms used turbines entirely built in China. Thus, the claim that \"the Obama administration spent money on windmills in China\" can be seen as an oversimplification or a generalization based on the parts sourced from China rather than the entire project funded by the stimulus.\n\nIn both instances, the article provides clarifying information about where the funding came from and details about the projects that show the claim to be misleading or inaccurate in certain respects. As such, it is more appropriate to label the claim as conflicting rather than true or false since it presents an incomplete or oversimplified picture of the facts presented in the article."

While it is true that the U.S. government had projected revenues of approximately $3 trillion during the fiscal year in question, it was also clear from the evidence that the Treasury secretary had warned that if Congress did not raise the debt ceiling, \"extraordinary measures\" taken since the spring would be exhausted by October 17, leaving only cash on hand and incoming revenues to meet obligations. This means that the government might not have enough funds to pay all its bills, potentially resulting in a default or at least delayed payments. Therefore, while the claim suggests that the federal government has sufficient resources to pay its bills without defaulting, the evidence presents a conflicting view on this matter due to the potential exhaustion of available funds and the need to prioritize payments if the debt ceiling is not raised."

The evidence shows that the board in question, the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), was established with the intention of reining in Medicare costs and making cost-savings proposals, but it does not have the power to make decisions about individual patient care or control patients' health care decisions.\n\nThe text explains that the IPAB is composed of individuals with expertise in various fields related to health finance, economics, actuarial science, and healthcare, among others. The members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, making them public officials rather than \"un-elected bureaucrats.\" Furthermore, the board's mandate explicitly states that it cannot ration care or make decisions on individual patients or their health care.\n\nThe evidence also shows that the IPAB is intended to address the issue of rising Medicare costs, a job that Congress has repeatedly declined to undertake. The board's recommendations are based on medical best practices and cost-savings, not on micro-managing patient care. In addition, the members of the IPAB become full-time government employees once appointed and are prohibited from holding other full-time employment, further contradicting the claim that they are \"bureaucrats.\"\n\nTherefore, it is inappropriate to say that President Obama and his allies gave control over Medicare patients' health care decisions to a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington. The IPAB was established with the goal of controlling costs within Medicare, not making individual patient care decisions."

    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that \"Ann Kuster supports the government takeover of healthcare, which robs Medicare of over $700 billion\" is labeled as False because the article provides evidence that directly contradicts this statement. Firstly, the article notes that the Affordable Care Act, for which Ann Kuster has expressed support, does not constitute a \"government takeover\" in the traditional sense, as it does not involve government ownership of hospitals or doctors. The term \"government takeover\" is shown to be politically charged and misleading, as it implies a European-style healthcare system where the government owns healthcare facilities and employs medical professionals.\n\n   Secondly, the article states that the claim that the Affordable Care Act \"robs\" $700 billion from Medicare is also disputed. The spending reductions in the law are presented as efforts to lower future Medicare costs rather than a literal theft of funds from the Medicare budget. The reductions were debated openly and transparently during the legislative process, and their purpose was to avoid adding to the deficit.\n\n   In addition, the article references past PolitiFact rulings that have found similar claims about the Affordable Care Act robbing Medicare to be inaccurate or misleading. These rulings range from False to Mostly False, showing a consistent pattern of such claims being debunked.\n\n   Therefore, the label of False is appropriate because the evidence presented clearly demonstrates that Ann Kuster does not support a government takeover of healthcare and that the Affordable Care Act does not rob Medicare of $700 billion."

    "justification": "Justification for Label: True\n\nThe claim that \"Says a proposed $1.05 billion Austin school district bond proposition \"will require no tax rate increase\"\" can be considered true based on the evidence presented. While it is important to note that tax payments may indeed increase due to rising property values, the district specifically states that it will not increase the tax rate to fund these bonds. Instead, they are planning to pay off the debt over time by tapping into increasing property values. This strategy, if successful, would allow the district to maintain the current tax rate without raising it for this particular bond issue. Therefore, in terms of the tax rate itself, the claim can be considered accurate, as it will not increase. However, caution should still be exercised regarding the overall impact on taxpayers' payments, which may rise due to the increase in property values."

While Missouri Department of Transportation Director Patrick McKenna stated this, the article does not provide direct evidence that Hyperloop One officials have made such a statement about the specific St. Louis-Kansas City route.

This equates to one-third when considering it as a percentage (one-third being equivalent to 33.33%, and 32% is slightly less than this). The evidence also shows that this situation has worsened since 2016, with more counties now limited to only one insurance provider on the online exchanges. Furthermore, the evidence clarifies that not every person in these counties would be affected, as there are still options outside of the marketplace, but for those enrolled in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, this statement holds true."

Furthermore, the NSF summary of the grant award indicates that the play was intended to educate the public about science and the scientific method in a neutral manner, aiming to increase public awareness, knowledge, and engagement with important science-related societal issues. The article also verifies that the play was scheduled to run in New York City, although not on Broadway, and tickets were available for purchase.

    "justification": "The claim made by Rep. Lynn Jenkins, \"In the 'do-nothing Senate,' there are 352 House bills 'sitting on Harry Reid\u2019s desk awaiting action,' including 55 introduced by Democrats,\" can be labeled as conflicting because the evidence provided in the article shows that the number of bills waiting for action is not definitively accurate.\n\nAlthough it is true that there are a significant number of House-passed bills currently sitting in the Senate, the claim oversimplifies the process and the actual status of these bills. The evidence explains that many bills assigned to committees require approval before being taken up on the floor, and the chair of the committee has some influence over whether a bill is fast-tracked or stalled. Additionally, it is unclear if all of these bills are actively awaiting action by Harry Reid personally, as some Senate activity related to them may be ongoing.\n\nMoreover, the evidence demonstrates that the number of 352 House bills waiting for action in the Senate, as stated by Jenkins, is slightly lower than the actual number. The article reveals a difference of 10 fewer bills due to the period between when Jenkins spoke and when the database was reviewed, suggesting some discrepancy in the numbers.\n\nLastly, the evidence highlights that only a portion of the 55 Democratic-sponsored bills awaiting action in the Senate can reasonably be described as substantive measures. Many of these bills are noncontroversial or intended for political statement rather than legislation. Therefore, Jenkins' claim that there are 352 bills waiting to be acted upon and that they include 55 Democratic-sponsored bills may oversimplify the reality of the situation and potentially exaggerate the extent of the partisan gridlock on Capitol Hill."

The article reveals that while the advertisement used in the opposition to recreational marijuana legalization in Arizona claimed that 50 percent of newborns tested at a Colorado hospital had marijuana in their systems, this claim was found to be misleading when the actual data was investigated.\n\nThe evidence shows that the data cited in the ad was cherry-picked from a single month (March 2016), specifically stating that out of 11 newborn babies tested during that month, five tested positive for marijuana, which is less than 50 percent (45.45%) and not half as claimed. When data from January 2016 through September 2016 was analyzed, it showed that slightly under 27 percent of the newborns tested positive for marijuana. Furthermore, when comparing the data from 2015, approximately 33 percent of the newborns tested were found to have marijuana in their systems.\n\nThese findings indicate that the initial claim of 50 percent is not accurate and has been misrepresented, making it a conflicting statement.

This is supported by the evidence provided which states that \"Measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed. If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected.\" This is nearly identical to the transmission description for measles provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Furthermore, the evidence indicates that if one person catches measles, a whopping 90 percent of people who are not immune will also become infected. This suggests that it is possible to contract measles from an infected person even after they have left a room, provided that the air and surfaces remain contaminated. Therefore, the evidence supports the claim that if someone enters a room where an infected person has been two hours ago, there is still a possibility of contracting measles from that person."

The source of this information was an investigative reporting website, The Austin Bulldog, which published a map and research in August 2011 indicating where every person who served on the Austin City Council from 1971 through 2011 lived at the time they were elected.\n\n   The report by The Austin Bulldog found that 58 out of 117 city offices filled in Austin elections (City Council including mayor) from 1971 through 2011 came from four ZIP codes - 78701, 78703, 78731 and 78759. The article states that these four ZIP codes accounted for 49.6% of the total number of city offices filled during this period when mayors are counted once, which aligns with the statement made by Gonzalo Barrientos.\n\n   Furthermore, the article also provides context and explanation for any discrepancies in the percentages, such as possible double-counting of mayors in some calculations, but these do not affect the overall validity of the initial claim that 55% of council members have come from an area where only 10% of Austinites live.\n\n   Therefore, based on the provided evidence, it can be concluded that the statement is 'True'."

Additionally, an additional 35,570 North Carolina voters matched on first and last name and date of birth, but not Social Security number, which requires further investigation. However, neither of these groups is large enough to suggest that \"probably over a million people voted twice in the election.\" The study acknowledges the need for thorough investigation due to potential clerical errors and the possibility of false positives. Moreover, the track record of similar projects shows that the number of confirmed cases of double voting drops significantly upon further investigation.

Although this figure was not three times more, it is worth noting that the high water meter charge in Flint significantly increased its overall cost, making it more expensive than Burlington. Furthermore, after a judge's ruling in August 2015 that led to a rollback of the emergency rate increase enacted in 2012, Flint's residents were still paying about 55% more than Burlington's residents for water (as per data from after the August 2015 ruling).

This is because the article clearly states that a similar federal review in the scope and scale as the one conducted in 1965 has not taken place since then.\n\nIn the 1960s, President Lyndon B. Johnson initiated the Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, which resulted in more than 200 recommendations that significantly impacted the US criminal justice system, including the establishment of the 911 emergency call system and research organizations like the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Since then, there have been other groups meeting and providing recommendations but none were as comprehensive as Johnson's commission in terms of scope, covering the entire criminal justice system from police to courts.\n\nMoreover, the article also highlights that Senator John Cornyn, in a recent conversation with Texas reporters, emphasized that no such review has taken place since 1965 and his proposed bill aims to address this gap by including community leaders, civil rights advocates, crime victims, social services providers, and public health officials. The creation of the Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice in January 2020 was mentioned, but it was pointed out that this commission is limited to law enforcement and crime control issues within the Department of Justice\u2019s jurisdiction, making it distinct from the comprehensive review conducted in 1965.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"The United States has not completed a \u2018top-to-bottom review of our criminal justice system at the national level since 1965'\" is accurate according to the evidence provided.

Furthermore, the article states that researchers from the University of Maryland National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism found no evidence of an attempted attack on Fort Knox in their database of foiled terrorist attacks.

Therefore, given the absence of publicly accessible research and the confirmation from Genesis Labs that their study is still undergoing peer-review and has not been published, it is accurate to conclude that there is no public study available on using the product Kaput to poison feral hogs."

Those figures stood at 65% and 66% in 2013\" can be verified as true based on the provided evidence. The evidence comes from a detailed explanation of how Texas Education Agency (TEA) records these percentages, and it is confirmed that the figures presented by Justice Don Willett, who refers to TEA data in his majority opinion, align with the state test results tracked by the Texas Education Agency. Furthermore, TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson and Shannon Housson from the TEA's performance reporting confirm that the percentages are correct. The evidence also provides information about how these percentages were calculated, such as the 124% and 54% respective improvements in students meeting the readiness standards over nine years, as well as the specific testing criteria used to determine college readiness (scale scores of 2200 on each relevant TAKS). This justification demonstrates that the claim is accurate, and therefore it is labeled 'True.'"

    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim that \"individuals who escaped these high tax states have taken with them around $2 trillion in adjusted gross income\" can be labeled as conflicting because the evidence does not provide a definitive answer regarding whether the stated figure ($2 trillion) represents all the money moving out of high-tax states into low-tax states, or simply the sum of all adjusted gross income moving across states over a 15-year period. The article discusses an author's estimate based on Internal Revenue Service and Census data but points out that there is contradictory wording in the book regarding this critical distinction, and efforts to clarify it with the author were unsuccessful. Additionally, the article mentions other experts who question the methodology and assumptions behind the $2 trillion figure, suggesting a lack of consensus among economists about its validity. Therefore, the conflicting label is appropriate as there are varying interpretations and uncertainties surrounding the estimate in question."

For the second part of the claim, the article cites a point-in-time projection from the budget assistant's office for the 2012-13 budget showing a revenue shortfall of $40.7 million, which can be interpreted as a deficit. The Democratic Party officers direct the author to this report as evidence for their claim about the 2012-13 budget.

Additionally, the article mentions that the flag's display began changing in meaning from a tribute to Confederate veterans around 1948, when it started being used as a symbol of Southern protest and resistance to federal government policies, particularly regarding racial desegregation.

    "taxonomy_label": "comparison",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate due to several reasons derived from the analysis of the evidence presented. Firstly, it becomes evident that the claim made by Allen West, \"Black people kill more black people every six months than the KKK did in 86 years,\" cannot be definitively confirmed or refuted based on the data provided by the FBI Uniform Crime Reports and the Tuskegee Institute study.\n\nThe data from the FBI shows that in 2012, approximately 2,936 black homicides occurred in a six-month span, which is not far off from the number of documented lynchings by whites over an 86-year period (3,446). However, this comparison assumes that the percentages of black homicides remain constant over time and do not change significantly.\n\nSecondly, the source used by Allen West for his claim, Kevin Jackson, provides different data about lynchings compared to what was actually reported. While Jackson's article claims that 3,446 blacks were killed by the KKK in 86 years, the actual number from the Tuskegee Institute study is 3,446 black documented lynchings at the hands of whites, not specifically the KKK.\n\nLastly, the comparison between contemporary black homicides and historical lynchings by the KKK is further complicated due to the lack of clear evidence showing that the KKK was involved in most lynchings during the period studied. Historian Michael Pfeifer points out that the Klan had three phases, and their role in the 1890s through the 1910s, a period when most lynchings occurred, is unclear.\n\nGiven these inconsistencies and lack of certainty about the data, it's not possible to conclusively determine whether West's claim is correct or incorrect, making the label \"Conflicting\" appropriate."

The evidence shows that while there has been a significant increase in teacher's pay, the actual increase falls short of the 15% mark when considering the timeframe mentioned (three years) and the entirety of the teacher's salary, including local supplements.

    "justification": "The claim states that by the end of 2015, more than 1,300 people will have died on Georgia roads, and one out of every four fatalities resulted from drunken driving. The evidence provided in the article supports both parts of this claim.\n\nFirstly, according to the Department of Transportation data presented in the article, as of Monday of the week the article was published, there were 1,345 traffic deaths in Georgia for the year 2015. This is more than the claimed threshold of 1,300 people.\n\nSecondly, the article states that 297 out of 1,179 fatalities in 2013 (approximately 25%) involved alcohol blood content of 0.08, which is the legal limit for drunken driving. While the exact percentage for 2015 is not provided, the article states that Harris Blackwood, the director of the Governor\u2019s Office of Highway Safety, said there are indicators suggesting a similar percentage for 2015, and that the percentage of alcohol as a factor has been consistent over a 10-year period.\n\nGiven these facts, it can be inferred that by the end of 2015, more than 1,300 people will have died on Georgia roads (true) and one out of every four fatalities is likely to have resulted from drunken driving, based on consistent trends over a 10-year period. Therefore, the label 'True' is appropriate for this claim."

In the article text, it is stated that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis of a six-year reauthorization projected a cumulative savings of $981 million, or nearly $1 billion. Furthermore, a 10-year reauthorization was projected to decrease the deficit by $6 billion over the 2018-2027 period, according to another CBO analysis cited in the article.

    "justification": "The claim that \"Abigail Spanberger wants a tax increase of $32 trillion to pay for her socialist health care plan\" can be labeled as False based on the following reasoning:\n\nThe evidence shows that Abigail Spanberger's stance on healthcare reform and taxes is not as extensive or costly as her opponent, U.S. Rep. Dave Brat, claims. While Spanberger did express support for single-payer healthcare during a debate, she never explicitly endorsed the Medicare for All Act of 2017 proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, which carries an estimated $32.6 trillion price tag over 10 years.\n\nMoreover, Spanberger advocated primarily for Medicare X, a public option that would give people under 65 an optional government-run program, and she did not mention Sen. Sanders or his plan specifically during the debate. The evidence suggests that Brat mischaracterized Spanberger's stance on healthcare by linking her to Sen. Sanders' Medicare for All Act of 2017 and its associated costs.\n\nFurthermore, the Congressional Budget Office has not published a cost analysis of Sen. Sanders\u2019 plan, and there is no evidence that Spanberger ever supported or endorsed this specific proposal. Therefore, it is incorrect to assert that Spanberger wants a tax increase of $32 trillion for her healthcare plan, as she has repeatedly denied Brat's charge and has expressed opposition to the Medicare for All Act of 2017 in subsequent interviews and statements."

The data presented shows an increase in unmarried births among black mothers and the percentage of black children living without a father, but neither figure supports the claim's assertion that there was a tenfold increase due to the Great Society. Furthermore, experts indicate that the data from the early- to mid-20th century is unreliable regarding black marriage, suggesting that the observed increase in unmarried births among African Americans may have been higher than what the early 1960s statistics officially indicated. Moreover, there were other social currents contributing to higher rates of single-motherhood for all races during the time period associated with the Great Society, which undermines any assertion that these changes can be solely attributed to President Johnson's policies. The evidence fails to establish a clear causal relationship between the Great Society and the increase in fatherlessness among black children."

The three previous Democrat gubernatorial candidates received their contributions solely during their respective gubernatorial campaigns, which is why they appear to have received less when considering only the timeframe of their gubernatorial run.

The evidence suggests that any such proposal by Campbell goes unmentioned in her campaign materials and website, where she expresses intentions to decrease taxation. Moreover, Campbell's support for a consumption tax instead of a property tax, should it truly lower the overall tax burden, is conditional and not part of her platform. Furthermore, Donna Campbell has signed several pledges disavowing higher taxes, contradicting the claim that she is pushing for a 35% sales tax."

    "justification": "The claim that \"The health care law adds around $800 billion of taxes on the American people. It does not discriminate between rich and poor\" is labeled as False because it incorrectly equates all revenue raised from Americans under the law as a tax. The evidence demonstrates that while there are new sources of revenue, such as the controversial tax penalty for those without health insurance and a tax on indoor tanning, not every source can be categorically defined as a tax. Furthermore, the law also includes provisions like tax credits for low- and moderate-income families to help them purchase insurance.\n\nRegarding the assertion that the law does not discriminate between rich and poor, the evidence reveals that this is unfounded. The law creates taxes primarily on higher income individuals and implements an individual mandate, while also providing tax credits and subsidies for lower-income families. This indicates that the health care law discriminates in favor of those with lower income, not equally affecting all Americans regardless of wealth."

    "justification": "The claim \"In 2012, the state 'put together a list of over 100,000 people that they thought were ineligible to vote. Came out there were less than 10.'\" is labeled as conflicting because the presented evidence provides inconsistent numbers regarding the number of noncitizens removed from the voter rolls in 2012.\n\nOn one hand, former Governor Charlie Crist claimed that \"coming out there were less than 10\" noncitizen voters removed. However, the evidence shows that at least 85 noncitizens were removed as of August 1, 2012 (which is within the 2012 timeframe), and when reaching out to county supervisors of elections, it was determined that more than 10 voters were removed in various counties (Miami-Dade: 16, Collier: 36, Broward: 7, Orange: 7, Lee: 6, Hillsborough: 2, Pasco: 2, Pinellas: 6). This suggests that Crist's claim of less than 10 is not accurate.\n\nOn the other hand, the evidence also indicates that the numbers provided by Crist might be correct in some context, as he stated \"just from news accounts, may have been around 40 or so actually,\" which is a range (40 or more) that includes his initial claim of less than 10.\n\nThe conflicting nature of this claim arises because the evidence provides numbers that do not align with each other and Crist's statement seems to encompass both possibilities, depending on the interpretation of his range. This highlights the need for clearer communication when reporting such figures in order to avoid confusion and potential misinformation."

    "justification": "Justification: The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the article presents two opposing viewpoints regarding public opinion on climate change in the United States. On one hand, Joe Scarborough claims that Americans began wandering away from the issue of climate change since 2004-06, as indicated by his statements such as \"From 2004, 2005, 2006, Americans were bought in to the concept of climate change and that we need to move aggressively on it,\" but since then, the public shifted, he said. Check the polling: Most Americans began wandering away from this issue.\" On the other hand, the evidence provided through various polls conducted by Gallup, Pew Research Center, and a group of university researchers indicates that while there has been a slight decline in public belief and concern about climate change since 2004, it has also experienced upswings and remains relatively consistent. For example, from 2002 to 2005, the value of the Climate Change Threat Index fluctuated between 40 and 45, then gained about 10 points. The percentage of people who believe global warming is underway or happening in their lifetime has also experienced similar ups and downs since 2002. Furthermore, when asked if they think global warming will pose a serious threat to them or their way of life in their lifetime, the public's response has yo-yoed but hasn't changed all that much. Additionally, the article acknowledges that Republicans can influence public opinion on climate change, with more Republican leaders treating it less seriously causing concern levels among Republican voters to drop.\n\n   In summary, while there has been a slight decline in some measures of public belief and concern about climate change since 2004, as claimed by Scarborough, the evidence provided shows that it remains relatively consistent or even experiences upswings, making the claim that \"Americans began wandering away from this issue\" somewhat conflicting with the actual polling data presented in the article."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim that Catherine Cortez Masto went after Uber and drove them out of town can be considered conflicting due to the following reasons supported by the evidence:\n\n1. Although it is true that Cortez Masto's office filed suits against Uber in multiple jurisdictions, these actions were taken in response to Uber launching without obtaining necessary permissions and operating illegally in Nevada. The suits were a result of the state's regulations and existing laws, rather than any personal action by Cortez Masto.\n\n2. The ad from Freedom Partners claims that Cortez Masto went after Uber \"three times\" until the company was driven out of the state, but the evidence suggests that this is an oversimplification of the situation. The multiple lawsuits were filed due to jurisdictional issues and a rush to file the suits, not because Cortez Masto sought repeated action against Uber.\n\n3. The ad also alleges that Cortez Masto accepted donations from taxi companies and used this as leverage to push out Uber, but the evidence shows that she declined requests from taxi companies who wanted to latch on to the state\u2019s lawsuit in order to avoid the appearance that they were doing the taxi industry's bidding.\n\n4. The ad claims that Cortez Masto's actions drove away jobs, but it is not clear how many jobs were lost as a result of Uber temporarily suspending operations due to the legal skirmishes. The evidence suggests that Uber eventually returned to Nevada and even managed to pass legislation allowing Transportation Network Companies to legally operate in the state, roughly a year after the initial legal conflicts.\n\n5. The ad's reference to $70,000 from taxi companies is accurate, but the context provided does not support the claim that this donation was used to push out Uber.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence provided suggests that Cortez Masto's actions against Uber were mandated by Nevada's regulations and existing laws, and her office acted on behalf of the state rather than targeting Uber personally. Furthermore, the ad oversimplifies the situation and does not provide clear evidence to support its claim that Cortez Masto drove Uber out of town and cost jobs. Therefore, it is appropriate to label this claim as conflicting."

The report states that about 20% of households and more than half of single parents would pay more in federal taxes under Trump's plan, which translates to approximately 5.8 million households or 51% of single parent families.\n\nThe analysis provides three reasons for this increase: (1) The standard deduction increase wouldn't offset the personal exemptions that Trump plans to eliminate; (2) Repealing the head of household filing status would require single parents to file as individuals with higher tax rates; and (3) Trump's three brackets would increase taxes for many head of household filers. Furthermore, Roberton Williams, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center, confirmed these findings by stating that a single parent with one child who claims the standard deduction would face a 25% tax rate under Trump\u2019s plan, compared to just a 15% rate under current law.\n\nIn conclusion, the provided evidence from the Tax Policy Center report substantiates the claim that under Donald Trump's tax plan, 51 percent of single parents would see their taxes go up."

    "justification": "Justification: The claim that \"a man opted out of Obamacare after the marketplace launched on Oct. 1, 2013, and was informed he owed a $4,000 fine\" is labeled as False because the presented evidence refutes several key aspects of the claim.\n\nFirstly, the text reveals that the original Facebook post could not be confirmed, raising doubts about the identity of the person who made the claim.\n\nSecondly, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (the agency that runs the marketplace) stated that it is not possible for people to \"opt-out\" after completing an online application, which contradicts the claim that someone chose to do so.\n\nThirdly, the evidence shows that any fines would be calculated as part of the user\u2019s overall income tax form 1040, rather than being sent as a bill as claimed in the post. Additionally, it is incorrect that the fines would be due immediately after being informed in early October, as a year and a half was given for their payment.\n\nFourthly, the amount of the fine stated in the claim ($4,037) is significantly greater than the actual penalty under the law. In 2014, the maximum penalty fee was 1 percent of yearly income or $95 per person, whichever is higher.\n\nLastly, the text refutes claims about potential penalties such as driver's license suspension and federal tax liens on homes. The Affordable Care Act does not mention those penalties for noncompliance, and neither the IRS nor state governments are authorized to enforce them.\n\nIn summary, the evidence provided shows that several critical aspects of the claim are incorrect or misleading, which justifies labeling it as False."

    "claim": "Says Walmart employees represent the largest group of Medicaid and food stamp recipients in many states, costing the taxpayer $1,000 per worker.",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The claim \"Says Walmart employees represent the largest group of Medicaid and food stamp recipients in many states, costing the taxpayer $1,000 per worker\" can be labeled as true based on the evidence provided. The evidence presents a consistent pattern across multiple states where Walmart consistently ranks among the top employers for individuals and their families enrolled in Medicaid, food stamps, and cash assistance programs. In most of these states, Walmart is identified as having the largest number of employees and family members eligible for these public assistance programs. The evidence also shows that in several states, such as Florida, Ohio, Maine, and Pennsylvania, Walmart indeed has a significant presence among food stamp recipients. Although there's no national tally of where food stamp recipients work, the evidence suggests that given Walmart's status as the largest private employer in the country, it is likely to have a substantial representation among food stamp recipients in many states. The claim about the cost of $1,000 per worker might require more specific data for accurate verification, but the evidence does suggest that the taxpayer spends a considerable amount on providing public assistance to Walmart employees. Overall, the evidence supports the truthfulness of the claim."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "Justification: The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because while the claim asserts that the University of Texas (UT) can afford to build a medical school due to its $7 billion endowment and football program's $50 million profit last year, the evidence provided demonstrates that this statement contradicts the financial reality at UT. The evidence shows that while UT does have a large endowment, it is not accessible for unrestricted use as claimed in the assertion. The endowment funds are primarily allocated to support specific scholarships, professorships, or other projects and cannot be redirected to fund a medical school without violating commitments to basic operating costs such as faculty and staff salaries and utilities.\n\n   Furthermore, while it is true that UT's football program generates substantial profits, these profits are already committed to various purposes, including covering administrative costs, supporting other sports programs, and transferring funds to academic programs. Therefore, redirecting the profits towards a medical school would leave other areas of the university underfunded.\n\n   Finally, the claim that UT can afford to build a medical school because it has $7 billion in endowment and $50 million in football profit last year is based on inaccurate or outdated information. The evidence shows that the $7 billion figure for UT's endowment is an estimation derived from various sources, including Wikipedia, and does not represent the actual value of funds available for unrestricted use. Similarly, the claim about the football program's profits comes from 2009-10 figures, while more recent financial reports indicate significantly higher profits, much of which is already committed to other purposes.\n\n   In summary, the evidence provided contradicts the claim that UT can afford to build a medical school due to its $7 billion endowment and football program's $50 million profit last year. Therefore, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim."

Instead, they agree that the bursting of the housing bubble and the global financial crisis were far and away the largest factors crippling the Florida economy at that time.

The evidence states that while the new law in North Carolina does prohibit local municipalities from passing anti-discrimination ordinances related to employment or public accommodations through December 1, 2020, this is not equivalent to ordering cities to discriminate against LGBT people. Furthermore, the evidence clarifies that the bathroom ban on transgender individuals using the bathroom of their identified gender has been lifted in North Carolina.

    "justification": "Justification: The claim that \"Radio Marti and TV Marti have spent more than $500 million to reach less than 1 percent of the Cuban population\" is true according to the evidence provided. The text states that a Government Accountability Office report from 2009 put total spending at over $500 million since the launch of Radio Marti in the mid-1980s, and a 2011 GAO report put it at $660 million. The same sources also mention that the best available research shows that the audience for TV Marti is small, with less than 1 percent of respondents to IBB telephone surveys since 2003 reporting they had watched TV Marti during the past week. Furthermore, a report from the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), which oversees the Marti project, states that \"it is small\" and notes that measuring audience size in Cuba faces significant challenges due to potential government repercussions for tuning in. Thus, based on the evidence provided, it is clear that both Radio Marti and TV Marti have spent over $500 million to reach less than 1 percent of the Cuban population."

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The claim \"Because of #TaxReform, 4 million American workers have received raises and bonuses, and 90% of Americans are seeing bigger paychecks this month\" can be labeled as True because the evidence provided supports both parts of the claim. For the first part, the evidence states that at least 286 companies had announced benefits for more than 3 million workers due to the tax reform by the end of January, which has since grown to over 4 million workers from 408 companies, as reported by Americans for Tax Reform. This clearly shows that a significant number of American workers have received raises, bonuses, or other financial benefits as a result of the tax reform. For the second part, the evidence indicates that the U.S. Department of the Treasury predicted in January that 90% of working Americans would have less federal tax withheld from their paychecks by the middle of February, given the new tax rates. While it's noted that we did not receive confirmation if this prediction panned out for February, the evidence does suggest that the majority of American workers were expected to see larger paychecks due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim can be considered True."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The label \"True\" is appropriate because the article provides evidence demonstrating that several planks from the 1956 Republican Party platform are indeed reminiscent of modern Democratic talking points. The evidence clearly indicates that the 1956 platform supported federal assistance for low-income communities, protection of Social Security, providing asylum for refugees, extending and improving minimum wage, strengthening labor laws to support unionization, and ensuring equal pay for equal work regardless of sex.\n\nThe article states that a meme summarizing these planks accurately portrays the 1956 platform, with some caveats. The platform did not fully support unions' key agenda item at the time, i.e., repealing \"right to work\" laws, and it did not explicitly address unemployment benefits or equal pay for women in every context. However, these omissions do not negate the fact that the 1956 platform supported a number of progressive policies typically associated with the modern Democratic Party.\n\nComparatively, the party's 2012 platform exhibits a significant shift to the right on many of these issues, as evidenced by its skepticism towards federal assistance for low-income communities, a more critical view of Social Security and immigration policies, an emphasis on free-market business practices rather than government regulation of labor markets, and a less positive stance on unions.\n\nThus, the claim that the 1956 Republican Party platform supported equal pay, the minimum wage, asylum for refugees, protections for unions, and more is validated by the evidence presented in the article. The article's findings show that while there were nuances to the platform, its progressive policies are a stark contrast to the party's more recent stance on these issues."

    "justification": "Justification: The claim \"Says that 'along the southern border of the U.S.,' the government apprehends 'seven individuals a day who are either known or suspected terrorists.'\" has been labeled as False because the evidence demonstrates that Vice President Mike Pence's statement is not accurate regarding the number of daily apprehensions of known or suspected terrorists at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe evidence provided shows that, according to a White House transcript and Vice President Pence's own remarks, he stated that 7 individuals a day are apprehended who are either known or suspected terrorists. However, the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center defines a \"known terrorist\" as an individual who has been arrested, charged or convicted of a crime related to terrorism or terrorist-related activities, or identified as a terrorist or member of a terrorist organization pursuant to statute, executive order, or international legal obligation. Additionally, a suspected terrorist is defined as an individual reasonably suspected to have engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism and/or terrorist activities.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence shows that data provided by Customs and Border Protection regarding individuals apprehended along the U.S.-Mexico border does not include counts of deterred or detained terrorists or suspected terrorists. The statistics point out that in January 2018 (the month before Pence's remarks), 35,822 individuals were apprehended in the Southwest Border region, which breaks out to 1,155 apprehended people a day. No data for terrorists apprehended at the border was provided.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence presented does not support Vice President Mike Pence's claim that seven individuals a day are apprehended along the southern border of the U.S. who are either known or suspected terrorists."

    "justification": "Justification: The claim that \"We had a waiting list in Chittenden County when I came into office of about 700... We opened a new treatment hub in St. Albans, and it reduced that number to zero\" is labeled as conflicting because the article provides evidence contradicting this statement. The evidence states that in January 2017 (when the Governor took office), there were only 134 people on the waitlist for the Chittenden hub, significantly less than the claimed 700. Furthermore, from September 2017 to August 2018, not a single person was on the waitlist at the Howard Center\u2019s Chittenden Clinic, the regional hub for Chittenden and Addison counties. This evidence suggests that the claim made by the Governor about the waiting list reduction is incorrect or exaggerated. The Governor's campaign did not provide any evidence to back up their claims when asked. Therefore, the claim is conflicting with the evidence provided in the article."

    "justification": "The claim that \"Ted Strickland wasted over $250,000 remodeling his bathrooms at the governor\u2019s mansion\" can be labeled as False because the evidence provided demonstrates that the money was not spent frivolously for the personal use or vanity of Ted Strickland. Instead, the funds were used to construct public restrooms in the carriage house of the governor's mansion to serve the estimated 20,000 annual tourists who visit the site. This construction project was initiated under the administration of Strickland's predecessor, Gov. Bob Taft, and was funded through private donations, federal funds, and a fund established by Taft for governor's residence improvements. Moreover, it was noted that Strickland made cost-cutting measures during his tenure, such as getting rid of the chef who worked at the governor's mansion. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the claim that Ted Strickland wasted over $250,000 on bathroom remodeling in the governor\u2019s mansion for personal gain or luxury."

The CBO report indicates that this would be achieved by increasing the net income of those living at or below the federal poverty level by $5 billion. Therefore, it can be concluded that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would indeed help lift a significant number of people out of poverty, albeit not \"over\" the million Americans claimed by Alison Lundergan Grimes. However, it's important to note that this figure could potentially be higher if not offset by job losses due to the minimum wage increase, as mentioned in the evidence."

    "justification": "The claim that \"Texas families have kept more than $10 billion in their family budgets since we successfully fought to restore Texas' sales tax deduction a decade ago\" can be deemed as true because of the following reasons:\n\n- Congressman Kevin Brady's spokeswoman, Tracee Evans, provided a news story published by The Dallas Morning News on September 22, 2014, which indicated that if the option to deduct state and local sales taxes had not been extended, Texans would owe an extra $1.2 billion to the IRS in April 2015.\n- By calculating the total amount deducted by Texans for sales tax in 2012 (which was $4,353,996,000), and multiplying that by a calculated average marginal tax rate of 27% for that year, Texas Comptroller's office estimated that Texans who took the deduction in 2012 reduced their federal income taxes by an estimated $1.18 billion all together.\n- Since the claim is about a decade (or 10 years) after the restoration of the sales tax deduction, and given that the estimated savings for one year was approximately $1.18 billion, it would be reasonable to assume that the total savings over ten years could amount to more than $10 billion.\n- Additionally, in October 2007, State Comptroller Susan Combs estimated the deduction was saving Texans $1 billion a year, which, if multiplied by ten years, does indeed result in a figure greater than $10 billion.\n- Although there is no specific 10-year impact figure provided by the Texas Comptroller's office, economist Stuart Greenfield, who asked for the Truth-O-Meter assessment, found that the methodology and Brady\u2019s cumulative figure seemed to add up after all, which lends further support to the claim.\n\nGiven these points of evidence, it is justifiable to conclude that the claim is true."

In his 2006 book, \"Winning Right: Campaign politics and conservative policies,\" Gillespie wrote about ensuring that uncovered adults gain health care insurance so they won't remain \"free riders\" who get care at others\u2019 expense. He suggested a method to accomplish this by cutting the standard deduction for uninsured people if they did not attest to having some form of health coverage, which is an economic penalty similar to a mandate. Furthermore, he also proposed the creation of tax-free Health Savings Accounts that would penalize individuals who didn't use their HSA funds for health care after seven years by treating the money as income tax. These policy suggestions align with the concept of individual mandates and enforcing them through the tax code, making Gillespie's book a promotion of such a policy. Despite Gillespie's assertion that he never supported an individual mandate and his campaign's attempt to downplay the mandate-like nature of the proposed policies, the evidence from the book points strongly towards promoting an individual health care mandate."

The subsidies go directly from the government to the insurer, but any abortions would be paid through a separate account funded entirely through a portion of premiums paid by people who select a plan that covers abortion services, not from tax dollars.

The pledge in question specifically concerned income taxes and not taxes in general or taxes such as the cigarette tax and motor vehicle fees that were included in the 2009 budget. Therefore, Crist did not break a recently signed pledge but rather a pledge made some time beforehand regarding income taxes only. This contradicts the claim of breaking a recently signed pledge.

The study predicted potential job losses based on hypothetical U.S. regulatory action to meet the carbon emission goals pledged in Paris, not on the Paris agreement itself.

    "justification": "The claim that \"The elimination of income and sales taxes in New York is equal to 9 percent of taxable income, meaning that if you make $100,000 a year you lose $9,000\" is false because while it is true that the average state and local tax deduction in New York is equal to 9 percent of a filer's income (as stated by Rep. Brian Higgins' spokeswoman Theresa Kennedy), this does not mean that filers would actually lose $9,000 outright. Instead, it means that they would no longer be able to deduct $9,000 from their federal taxes. The actual amount saved depends on the tax rate, and in the case of a couple making $100,000 (as given as an example), the savings would be $2,250 according to the IRS. Furthermore, the House Republican tax plan only proposes to end the deduction for state income and sales tax altogether, but keeps the deduction for property taxes with a cap of $10,000. This means that if someone's property tax bill is more than $10,000, they would not be able to deduct the entire amount, but the difference could not be deducted. Therefore, the claim that filers would lose $9,000 outright is inaccurate."

    "justification": "The claim that \"There's a 1.5 percent to 2 percent overhead in Medicare. The insurance companies have a 20 percent to 30 percent overhead\" is labeled as conflicting because the evidence from a trusted source, such as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), presents different figures.\n\nIn particular, the 2011 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds shows that Medicare's administrative expenses accounted for 1.3% of total expenditures in 2010. On the other hand, the CBO cites data from the McKinsey Global Institute to estimate that private insurers' administrative costs were at 12%. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also reported an administrative cost of 11.1% for private insurers in 2009, which is closer to the figure provided by Sen. Barbara Boxer but still significantly lower than her suggested range.\n\nMoreover, the text explains that the administrative burden for private plans varies greatly depending on factors such as the size of the plan and whether it's employer-based or individual. The variations in these data points also contribute to the conflicting nature of Sen. Boxer's claim."

    "justification": "The claim that \"Says Hillary Clinton\u2019s approval rating went from 70 percent to 52 percent in 18 months\" is labeled as conflicting because the information presented in the evidence demonstrates inconsistencies regarding Clinton's approval ratings over time. While Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus stated that Clinton's approval rating had dropped by 18 points (from 70% to 52%) during an 18-month period, the article reveals conflicting figures from various poll sources.\n\n   The evidence mentions a Bloomberg National Poll from December 2012 which found Clinton's net favorable rating at just 52%, while other polls around that time put her approval rating as high as 67%. It also indicates that the Huffington Post Pollster, which aggregates and averages most credible polls, had Clinton\u2019s favorability rating at 58.2% on Dec. 9, 2012. Furthermore, the article suggests that while a drop in favorability was observed in Clinton's approval ratings from December 2012 to June 2014, it was not as drastic as suggested by Priebus (a drop of 18 points versus 5 points according to the data presented).\n\n   Thus, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this claim because there are conflicting and inconsistent figures presented in the evidence regarding Clinton's approval rating over the specified time period."

    "justification": "The claim that Donald Trump's tax plan gives the wealthy and corporations \"more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two\" can be justified as true based on the evidence provided in the article. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Bush tax cuts increased the after-tax income of the top 1% between 5.3% and 6.7%, which amounts to about 0.66% of GDP. On the other hand, Trump's tax plan would increase the after-tax incomes of the wealthy between 10.2% to 19.9%, according to the Tax Foundation, and deliver a tax cut equivalent to about 1.32% of GDP. Therefore, it can be seen that the top 1% under Trump's tax plan would receive a tax break equivalent to about twice as much as they did under the Bush tax cuts, supporting the claim made in the article. Furthermore, the article provides additional details on key provisions of Trump's tax plan that contribute to the increased benefits for the wealthy, such as reducing the top marginal income tax rate and corporate income tax rate, and not taking into account one additional proposal (eliminating the carried interest tax break) could potentially increase the gains for the top 1%. Thus, it can be concluded that Clinton's statement in the debate is accurate based on the evidence presented."

According to the Congressional Record, Hurd requested to resign from the House Committee on Small Business in a letter dated March 16, 2015, and cited his other existing committee assignments as the reason for his decision. Furthermore, there is no evidence provided that Hurd resigned two weeks prior to the article's publication date (April 7, 2015). Instead, it appears from the text that Hurd had already been removed from the small business committee at least a month before Gallego made his claim in an April 2, 2015 email blast.

    "justification": "The claim that \"The 'working tax cut' created over 40,000 new jobs in just the last four years\" is labeled as False because the evidence presented shows that the data used by Associated Industries of Florida (AIF) to support their claim does not accurately reflect the growth of insurance industry jobs.\n\nThe discrepancy lies in how the job numbers are calculated. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which provide the data for the state reports referenced by AIF, there was a net loss of insurance industry jobs between 2007 and 2010. This contradicts AIF's claim that over 40,000 new jobs were created in the last four years.\n\nFurthermore, it is suggested that the apparent growth in jobs may be due to a change in how the job numbers are calculated, not as a result of the \"working tax cut.\" The state's count for insurance jobs in 2007 excluded proprietors and general partners, but the 2010 number included them. An apples-to-apples comparison of job growth shows that the state actually lost insurance industry jobs between 2007 and 2010 when comparing the same set of data.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it cannot be accurately claimed that the \"working tax cut\" created over 40,000 new jobs in just the last four years."

    "justification": "The claim that \"The administration has issued rules for '$1 abortions in ObamaCare' and 'requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay' an abortion premium\" can be labeled as False according to the evidence provided. This is due to several reasons:\n\n1. The evidence explains that the \"$1 abortions\" claim is based on the Obama administration setting a minimum amount of $1 per enrollee, per month for insurers offering plans that include abortion coverage. However, this amount is for filling the account where the money for abortion services will be kept, not for the cost of an abortion itself.\n\n2. The evidence also makes clear that this rule applies only to insurers offering such coverage and does not mandate all persons enrolled in insurance plans to pay a separate premium for abortion. Instead, it states that federal dollars and most of the premiums paid by the plan's beneficiaries will go into the non-abortion account, with a fraction sent to the abortion account.\n\n3. Lastly, the evidence points out that even if you have the opportunity to buy abortion coverage on the exchanges, it won't be forced upon anyone and tax dollars sent to those plans through federal subsidies will be placed in accounts walled off from accounts used to pay for abortion services. This means that anyone purchasing a plan with abortion coverage will be doing so by choice and paying for it personally.\n\nIn summary, the evidence provided demonstrates that the claim is not accurate as it has misrepresented the $1 amount as related to the cost of an abortion and has incorrectly stated that all persons enrolled in insurance plans are required to pay a separate premium for abortion coverage."

This is a slight discrepancy from what Mook stated in the debate (0.2 percent), but it still falls well within the range suggested by Sanders during the debate.\n\nFurthermore, the article also acknowledges that while Mook focused solely on employee donations, other analyses by Greenpeace and The Huffington Post have pointed out that Clinton's campaign has received additional donations from lobbyists with ties to oil and gas interests. However, these lobbyist-derived donations are not reported as coming from employees of the oil and gas industry, and thus were not included in the total calculated by the article.\n\nDespite this potential oversight, the overall statement remains accurate based on the direct evidence presented."

Michele Bachmann was not based on continuing \"President Obama\u2019s policies.\" Instead, it was a projection made by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) about what would happen if current laws are left unchanged, which is not what President Obama advocates. The CBO's projection of 9.1% unemployment in the fourth quarter next year is based on the scenario where there is no resolution to the fiscal cliff, resulting in steep automatic spending cuts and the expiration of major tax cuts, neither of which are part of President Obama's policies. In fact, the CBO projects that if lawmakers and the president work out a deal that keeps the tax cuts and avoids automatic spending cuts, among other things, unemployment would drop to 8%. Therefore, the claim that we will see over 9% unemployment next year due to continuing President Obama's policies is not supported by the evidence."

While Kuster argues that the bill does not pause the program, the text of the bill and statements from the White House, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI Director James Comey, and other lawmakers suggest otherwise.\n\n   The bill, as explained in the article, adds layers of certification beyond what\u2019s already on the books requiring that refugees are safe before entering the United States. This additional process is likely to cause delays, which could effectively pause or slow down the resettlement program for Syrian refugees. Furthermore, supporters of the bill, such as House Republicans, have explicitly stated that the bill would require a \"pause\" in admitting Syrian and Iraqi refugees while a new vetting process was established.\n\n   However, it is worth noting that Kuster and 46 other House Democrats who supported the bill interpreted it as not hurting the refugee process significantly, suggesting that they believe the additional certifications could be put into place without many problems. This interpretation contradicts the implications of the bill as described in the evidence provided, which suggests that the delays caused by these additional checks could indeed pause or slow down the resettlement program.\n\n   Therefore, while Kuster's statement may not have been intentionally misleading, it is conflicting based on the information presented in the article."

This claim is further substantiated when Andrew Dabalen, a lead economist at the World Bank, acknowledges that 21 countries do not have at least two comparable surveys since 1990, making it impossible to accurately say anything about trends in poverty. Moreover, alternative methods for deriving missing data points are mentioned but acknowledged to be imperfect and potentially misleading, further supporting Jerven's claim of insufficient data.

The increase is largely due to population growth rather than job market improvement.\n\nThe article reveals that although there were 3.07 million Hoosiers working in May 2016, which is more than at any other time in history, this figure doesn't tell the whole story. A more meaningful comparison would be the percentage of Indiana residents who are employed, rather than just the raw number.\n\nAccording to Census Bureau data, in 2015 there were about 6.48 million people living in Indiana. So only 47.3% of Indiana's population was working in 2016. However, in May 2000, when the raw number of Hoosiers employed reached its previous high, 49.7% of Indiana's then-population of 6.08 million people were working. This means a larger percentage of Indiana residents were employed in 2000 than in 2016.\n\nFurthermore, the article explains that focusing on the total number of people employed can be misleading and may not accurately reflect the health of the job market. The unemployment rate, which takes into account only those actively looking for a job, is a more reliable indicator of the job market's strength. Indiana's current 5% unemployment rate is considered good but is far from a historical low.\n\nIn conclusion, while more Hoosiers are going to work today than at any other point in history, this increase does not necessarily indicate a stronger economy. The raw number of people employed is less significant than the percentage of Indiana's population that is working, and unemployment rates provide a better measure of job market strength.

The evidence states that the National Partnership For Women & Families analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which showed that full-time working women in Oregon earned $37,381 a year, while their male counterparts earned $47,402 - a difference of $10,021 or 79 cents for every dollar men earned. This data aligns with the claim that women are paid 79 cents for every dollar men earn in Oregon, thus validating its truthfulness.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence provides supporting examples of how closing the wage gap would impact a woman's life by giving her enough money for 2,877 gallons of gas, 72 more weeks of food for her family, or nearly 12 more months of rent. While there are slight discrepancies in the exact quantities due to factors such as fluctuations in gas prices and rounding of figures, these differences do not negate the overall validity of the claim since they are within reasonable margins of error.\n\nTherefore, based on this evidence, it can be concluded that the claim is \"True.\""

This number is significantly lower than the highest misery index during Ronald Reagan's presidency, which was 21.98 in June 1980 (Carter's last year as president). Furthermore, the article presents data showing that the misery index was higher at various points throughout Reagan's first three years in office than it was in October 2011.

    "justification": "The claim that \"In 45 out of 50 states, on average men are seeing their premiums double, going up 99 percent. Women up 62 percent\" can be labeled as conflicting because the evidence provided indicates that the numbers presented by Hannity are not accurate or complete.\n\nThe evidence shows that Hannity's claim is based on a study by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, which focused on insurance rates in the online marketplaces, accounting for less than 10 percent of the total private insurance market. Moreover, the study did not factor in federal government subsidies, which will reduce many people\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses and partially offset higher premiums.\n\nFurthermore, Hannity's claim lumps together people who purchase insurance on their own with people who receive it through their employer, which is an error since the study specifically addressed the individual market. Therefore, the claim is conflicting as it presents data that does not represent the entirety of the insured population and omits crucial factors such as federal subsidies."

The supporting evidence demonstrates that there is disagreement and contradiction among experts regarding the specific risk percentage associated with prolonged standing during pregnancy and pre-term birth.\n\nThe article mentions several studies, including one from 1995, which found a 20% increase in the likelihood of premature delivery for women who stood at work for five hours per day, significantly lower than the 80% claim made in the original statement. Another study cited found an increased risk of preterm birth by 26%, which is also substantially lower than the 80%.\n\nMoreover, the article discusses a 2000 review in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology that combined results from multiple studies on prolonged standing and pre-term birth. This review found that prolonged standing increased the risk by 26%, which is much lower than the 80% claim made in the original statement.\n\nThe article also mentions that some more recent studies have found no significant risk or a significantly smaller risk for premature delivery among women who stand for more than six hours per day, further contradicting the claim made in the original statement.\n\nIn summary, the evidence provided shows that various experts disagree on the specific risk percentage associated with prolonged standing during pregnancy and pre-term birth, making the claim conflicting."

However, her position was more cautious than Obama's in this specific context, as she planned to send envoys rather than meet herself without preconditions.\n\n   Furthermore, Sanders' statement that Clinton was wrong and Obama was right in their approach to Iran is also an oversimplification of the nuanced positions held by both candidates during the 2008 Democratic primary. The evidence shows that their differences were not as straightforward as the claim suggests, and both candidates had distinct but valid arguments for their diplomatic strategies towards Iran.\n\n   Therefore, the claim presents a conflicting picture of the actual events, as it omits key details and distorts Clinton's position on the matter to imply she was dismissive of diplomacy with Iran, which is not fully supported by the evidence provided."

Despite that trend, Texas schools in 2017 will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003\" is labeled as conflicting because, according to the provided evidence, both the Center for Public Policy Priorities report and the Legislative Budget Board analysis contradict each other regarding the real change in per-student spending when adjusted for inflation.\n\nWhile the report suggests that Texas schools will receive $381 less per student in 2017 than they did in 2003, the Legislative Budget Board analysis indicates a slight increase in per-student spending ($10,111 in 2017 versus $10,078 in 2003). The discrepancy arises from the different inflation indices used for adjusting the data: the report uses the Implicit Price Deflator for state/local government from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, while the board uniformly employs the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to analyze education spending. There is no consensus about using the IPD rather than CPI when analyzing education spending, as both methods have their advantages and disadvantages in capturing cost increases for governments.\n\nTherefore, it is conflicting to claim that per-student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years while simultaneously arguing that schools will receive $381 less per student in 2017 than they did in 2003, as both claims cannot be true based on the available evidence."

The evidence shows a steady increase in vacancies except for a dip in 2017, with the rate more than quadrupling over eight years, supporting the claim that vacancy rates went from 2.9% to 15.2%.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided evidence, the label \"True\" is appropriate as the prison population did expand, and correctional officer vacancies did increase significantly over the last eight years."

    "justification": "The claim made by Charlie Crist states that utility costs went up 30 percent during his governorship and then dropped 11 percent since Rick Scott took office, putting Florida below the national average again. However, the evidence provided indicates that this is not accurate.\n\nFirstly, the data from the Florida Public Service Commission shows that electric rates for three out of four large investor-owned power companies in Florida peaked during Crist's administration in 2009. While there were increases in these rates, it was primarily due to large increases in fuel recovery costs rather than an increase in base rates, which are under the governor's control.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that from 2007 to 2011, when Scott took office, the average monthly residential electric bill actually decreased slightly, not increased by 30 percent as claimed. The rate was higher during Crist's last year in office (11.18 cents per kilowatt hour) than it was in his first year (11.43 cents), contradicting the claim that utility costs went up significantly during his governorship.\n\nLastly, there has not been an 11 percent decrease in utility rates under Scott's tenure as claimed. In fact, the latest data available shows a slight increase of 5.6 percent since Scott took office, not a decrease. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that Florida was already above the national average in residential utility rates when Crist came into office and remained above the national average during his term, though by less than when he started.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, it is appropriate to label the claim as false, as it does not align with the data on utility costs during Charlie Crist's governorship and the subsequent years under Rick Scott."

    "justification": "The claim states that \"All Aboard Florida is a 100 percent private venture. There is no state money involved.\" However, the evidence presented in the article clearly contradicts this assertion.\n\nFirstly, the article points out that the Florida Legislature approved $10 million in \"quiet zone\" money for horns at railroad crossings which can be applied for by local government agencies for any rail crossing, not exclusively for those used by All Aboard Florida. This shows that state funds are being directly allocated towards infrastructure associated with All Aboard Florida.\n\nSecondly, the article mentions that the Orlando International Airport is building an intermodal transportation facility where All Aboard Florida will be accommodated. Although All Aboard Florida will pay for its usage, the construction of this facility receives a loan and grant from the state. While it's stated that the airport will reimburse the state for the portion related to the rail connection, this still indicates that state funds are being used indirectly for All Aboard Florida.\n\nLastly, the article states that All Aboard Florida was initially proposed to use $44 million in state money to connect their trains to Tri-Rail, although this idea did not materialize and was officially shut down amid publicity. However, the fact that the proposal was made indicates a potential for state funding involvement.\n\nGiven these points of contention, it's clear that there is both federal and state money involved in All Aboard Florida, contradicting the initial claim that there is no state money involved.

    "justification": "The claim \"Says U.S. Rep. Connie Mack 'took seven and a half years to finish college'\" receives the label \"Conflicting\" because there are conflicting reports about how long it took Mack to complete his education. On one hand, news articles have reported that Mack took seven or seven and a half years to finish college (as acknowledged by the statement). However, further investigation reveals that Mack actually attended Sante Fe Community College from spring 1986 to June 1988, which amounts to approximately two and a half years. He then transferred to the University of Florida in May 1988 and graduated with his bachelor's degree in advertising in May 1993, which is about five years later.\n\n   The confusion arises from two factors. First, Mack was dual-enrolled in high school and college in the spring of 1986, overlapping technically with the time he enrolled in community college. Secondly, Mack took a two-year break from school (1991 and 1992) to work full-time. During this time, he finished his education through correspondence classes, earning his diploma in 1993.\n\n   While the total duration from enrollment at Sante Fe Community College to graduation from the University of Florida appears to be seven and a half years, it is important to note that Mack was not actively pursuing his degree for this entire period due to the two-year break from school. Thus, the conflicting information in the claim stems from the fact that the total duration includes time when Mack was not enrolled in classes but still technically working towards his degree through correspondence courses. This ambiguity makes the claim \"Conflicting.\""

However, it also shows that many official condemnations of the attacks were issued by governments and religious leaders of these same nations.

Using these figures, it's calculated that the portion of taxes on an average-value residence that goes to recapture is $1,355.\n\nFurthermore, experts consulted by the article confirm the calculation method used by AISD, making the claim more reliable and supported. In addition, the article also provides historical context of AISD's recapture payments, showing that they are projected to exceed $630 million in 2019, implying a significant ongoing burden on Austin homeowners for recapture payments.\n\nTherefore, based on this evidence, it is accurate to label the claim as \"True.\""

This is because the supporting article text clearly states that the information comes from a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis, which determined that passing a bill that delays the start of the requirement for individuals to secure health insurance coverage and the associated tax penalties would save $35.4 billion over 10 years. The savings are primarily due to fewer uninsured Americans signing up for government health care programs or receiving federal subsidies, and more Americans receiving taxable income instead of non-taxable health insurance. While it's mentioned that there are costs associated with the delay (such as an increase in the number of people without health insurance), the article does not dispute the accuracy of the $35 billion savings figure over the 10-year period.

While there appears to be a slight discrepancy in the exact figures provided by the evidence and the claim (with the claim stating \"almost\" $1,500), it is important to note that the evidence shows the original claim made by Governor Abbott was closer to $1,500 rather than over $1,500.

The evidence further explains that these documents are highly technical and do not make any such sweeping predictions about the complete replacement of trees as a source of paper. In fact, the authors' powers of prediction in these documents were shown to be faulty as their prediction that \"without doubt, hemp will continue to be one of the staple agricultural crops of the United States\" did not come to pass.

He also made it clear that normalizing relations with Cuba should be contingent upon progress towards these goals, including releasing political prisoners, promoting freedom of speech, assembly, and a free press, and holding fair elections.\n\nFurthermore, in May 2008, Obama gave a speech in Miami where he reiterated his commitment to \"libertad\" (Spanish for freedom) and emphasized that the road to freedom for all Cubans must begin with justice for Cuba's political prisoners, the right of free speech, a free press, freedom of assembly, and free and fair elections.

Rick Perry's spokesman confirmed that Perry was referring to this specific Obama speech in which he referred to Medicaid as \"broken.\" Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it is accurate to say that Obama did call Medicaid 'broken' four years ago."

    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that \"Says he has 'yet to get a response' from Barack Obama to his August 2010 letter making border security requests\" is labeled as False because there is evidence that shows Governor Rick Perry received a response from John O. Brennan, assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, on August 27, 2010. The response was made on White House letterhead, acknowledging Perry's concerns regarding border security and appreciating his outreach. Additionally, the evidence shows that the Obama administration had taken steps to address Perry's requests by signing the Southwest Border Security Act into law, which added resources such as National Guard troops along the border. Therefore, it is inaccurate for Perry to claim he has yet to receive a response from Barack Obama."

    "justification": "The claim that \"President Dwight Eisenhower moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country\" is labeled as \"Conflicting.\" This label is appropriate because the evidence provided indicates that there were significant deportations during Operation Wetback under President Eisenhower, but estimates on the exact number of people who were deported vary greatly, ranging from 250,000 to 1.3 million. The article suggests that the official apprehensions did not come close to the highest estimate, and there is evidence that a significant portion of those targeted for deportation self-deported or did not return to Mexico in large numbers. Therefore, while it is accurate to say that Eisenhower oversaw a campaign that resulted in many deportations, it is not supported by the evidence to claim that 1.5 million illegal immigrants were moved out of the country during this operation. Trump's statement can be seen as an exaggeration or a twist on the facts, and thus the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because while Bill Nelson did vote in favor of the bill that became Obamacare, the claim that he cast the \"deciding vote\" is not accurate and relies on political spin. The evidence indicates that Nelson was not one of the senators who held out until the last minute, as the Los Angeles Times reported, and thus his vote was not critical in passing the bill. However, the statement from American Crossroads suggests that Nelson's vote was decisive in the passage of Obamacare.\n\n   Furthermore, the claim that the health care law cuts Medicare spending by $700 billion is a common talking point, but it requires careful interpretation to understand its accuracy. The CBO found that the health care law reduced Medicare outlays by $716 billion over ten years (from 2013 to 2022), but this is not the same as cutting a dollar amount from the Medicare program's budget each year or reducing benefits for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n   Finally, the claim that the health care law \"lets an unelected board decide what gets covered here\" oversimplifies the role of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). While it is true that the IPAB can make recommendations to reduce Medicare costs, it is prohibited from rationing care or denying treatments to patients and cannot change who is eligible for Medicare or raise premiums for beneficiaries. Therefore, the claim that patients could find their benefits \"rationed\" or that the health care law allows the IPAB to make decisions about individual American's healthcare is exaggerated and misleading.\n\n   In conclusion, while Bill Nelson did vote in favor of Obamacare, he did not cast the deciding vote as claimed by American Crossroads. The claim that the health care law cuts Medicare spending by $700 billion requires careful interpretation to understand its accuracy, and the claim that the health care law allows an unelected board to make decisions about individual American's healthcare is misleading. These claims are conflicting with the evidence presented."

The plan's estimated revenue, based on a 15% flat income and corporate tax rate without deductions or loopholes, is found to be $2.6 trillion. However, government spending for 2015 is anticipated to be $3.7 trillion according to the Congressional Budget Office. This means that under Carson's proposed plan, there would still be a shortfall of $0.6 trillion in revenue compared to anticipated spending, and $1.1 trillion if we consider the current level of government spending. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is evident that Ben Carson's tax plan would indeed leave the federal government with a significant budgetary hole."

The evidence shows that after the passing of the tough gun laws following the Martin Bryant shootings in 1996, the number of gun homicides in Australia significantly decreased.\n\nFor instance, the number of gun homicides fell from 69 in 1996 (excluding the victims of the mass shooting) to 30 in 2012, which represents a decrease of 56.5 percent. Additionally, reputable researchers found that in the decade after the gun laws were implemented, firearm homicides dropped 59 percent. This substantial drop supports the claim that homicides by firearm have declined almost 60 percent since Australia passed tough gun laws.\n\nWhile the evidence suggests that the decrease in gun homicides is likely due to the new gun laws, it's acknowledged that further research and analysis are necessary to definitively establish the causal relationship between the laws and the decline in gun violence.

The article explains that when considering the entirety of Obama's term in office, job growth was less than the claimed figure due to losses in the public sector. Therefore, the claim is accurate within certain parameters, but it does not reflect the full picture of job growth during Obama's presidency. This makes the claim somewhat misleading, as it gives the impression that job growth was consistently strong throughout his term when this was not always the case."

The evidence demonstrates that the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) offers an alternative measure of labor underutilization known as U-6, which calculates unemployment by including three groups: unemployed, marginally attached to the labor force, and working part-time for economic reasons. In January 2012, the U-6 rate was 15.1 percent, supporting the claim that the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent when considering these additional categories of people. Furthermore, the article notes that Romney's statement is an improvement from his previous phrasing in the Tampa debate, where he did not explicitly reference the broader U-6 methodology.

In one instance, Trump stated that McCain \"is not a war hero,\" while in another, he said five times, \"He (McCain) is a war hero.\" However, the context of these statements reveals that Trump qualifies his praise with conditions such as McCain being captured or implies that being a war hero doesn't mean anything special if one gets captured. These additions to his statements about McCain undermine his initial assertion that McCain is a hero, creating an apparent conflict in his position. Furthermore, experts quoted in the article suggest that Trump's qualifications significantly change the meaning of his sentence, implying that he does not view McCain as an exceptional war hero due to his capture.

Therefore, McCrory did not actively \"shepherd in\" the policy change as stated in the claim. Furthermore, the evidence also reveals that McCrory was the only Republican governor since 9/11, but the policy change under discussion occurred in response to 9/11, which was over a decade after the terrorist attacks.

According to the evidence, it was stated that before Governor Charlie Crist took office in 2007, there was no cap on how much the price of undergraduate tuition could go up. In 2009, the Legislature allowed the largest state research universities to raise rates up to 15 percent per year. Furthermore, the evidence explains that during Crist's governorship, the Legislature increased college tuition by 6 percent in 2008 and 8 percent in 2009, with the total increase reaching 15 percent for those years. Although Governor Crist initially opposed raising tuition in 2007, he later reversed his decision and the 5 percent hike took effect. Additionally, it was stated that the Legislature approved a new plan in 2009, allowing the Board of Governors to raise undergraduate tuition rates past whatever the Legislature approved as long as the total increase didn't exceed 15 percent per year.

The study ultimately found numerous barriers to accomplishing binational health insurance and no further action was taken. Therefore, while Perry did discuss the idea, it is unclear from the evidence provided whether he advocated for its immediate adoption or merely supported a study to explore its potential viability.

This percentage is significantly lower than the poverty rate for the general population, indicating a strong correlation between employment and decreased poverty levels. However, it should be noted that the evidence does acknowledge that the claim might not be exactly 97%, but closer to 93%. Nonetheless, this slight deviation from the exact figure does not disprove the overall validity of the claim, as it still suggests a very high probability of avoiding poverty with full-time employment."

This is supported by Nancy Pelosi's statement during her CNN interview and confirmed by her spokesman, who cited a report from the Tax Policy Center. The report found that 70% of the total tax benefits from Trump\u2019s child care plan would go to families earning more than $100,000 per year. This is due to the structure of Trump's proposal, which relies on tax deductions that are worth more per dollar for higher income families, as they face higher marginal tax rates. Additionally, lower-income families often rely on informal, low-cost child care arrangements and may spend less on child care expenses. This results in a smaller share of benefits for these families compared to higher-income families. Furthermore, the report also finds that Trump's proposed tax credit for lower-income families is worth less than the deduction and that lower income families are less likely to place money into Trump\u2019s proposed savings accounts due to lower levels of financial liquidity. These findings support the claim that 70 percent of benefits in Donald Trump\u2019s proposal for child care go to the people making over $100,000 a year."

Furthermore, the article mentions that the New Hampshire Insurance Commissioner Roger Sevigny had previously stated that the state would allow renewal of non-compliant plans, which further supports the claim's accuracy."

    "justification": "The claim that \"I think with the exception of the last year or maybe the last two years, we were at 100 percent\" when it came to contributing to the Providence pension fund is labeled as True based on the evidence provided in the article. According to the report, the contribution level rose after David Cicilline took over as Mayor and, with the exception of one year (2006), the city's pension contributions were made at 100 percent or within just a few percentage points during his administration. Moreover, it is stated in the article that \"With the exception of two of the budgets proposed and implemented during his administration, the city's pension contributions were made at 100 percent or within just a few percentage points.\" This statement clearly shows that the contribution was made at 100 percent for most years during Cicilline's tenure as Mayor. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim made by Cicilline is accurate and true, with only minor discrepancies in specific years."

    "justification": "The claim \"The group that organized Texas Muslim Capitol Day in Austin 'was recently listed as one of 82 organizations designated as a terrorist group by the United Arab Emirates'\" has been labeled as conflicting due to ambiguity and contrasting information within the presented evidence. While it is true that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did list the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), an organization involved in Texas Muslim Capitol Day, among 82 designated terrorist groups, this label has been widely disputed by the council itself and other experts. In the evidence provided, CAIR's national spokesman Ibrahim Hooper stated that the council has no connection to the Muslim Brotherhood, which was the reason for their inclusion on the UAE list according to UAE Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Additionally, the State Department and other experts have criticized the UAE's list for its questionable criteria and overly broad definition of terrorism. Furthermore, the council has never been charged with criminal activity or terrorist acts in the United States, as mentioned by multiple sources within the evidence. Thus, the conflicting nature of this claim stems from the ongoing debate and dispute surrounding the UAE's designation of CAIR as a terrorist organization."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "Justification: The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the statement made by Senator Bill Nelson claims that Connie Mack taking two homestead exemptions is directly contrary to Florida\u2019s Constitution. This claim is supported by the text which states that Florida\u2019s Constitution allows only one homestead exemption per individual or family unit, and that Mack has been granted two such exemptions, one for a condo in Fort Myers and another for his wife's California home. However, it is also mentioned in the text that Mack's campaign spokesperson provided documentation to the relevant authorities and they ruled that Mack is entitled to the homestead exemption in Fort Myers, indicating that he may have fulfilled certain requirements to justify holding two homestead exemptions. This suggests a potential conflict between Nelson's claim and the findings of the Lee County Property Appraiser. Thus, the label \"Conflicting\" is justified as there appears to be opposing information regarding Mack's use of multiple homestead exemptions."

The evidence suggests that the anti-stadium group's analysis, which arrived at the \"$1 billion giveaway\" figure, is flawed in several ways:\n\n   - The calculation assumes an 80-year lease term, which is too long a time period to forecast accurately and doesn't account for factors like potential changes in sports popularity or meteor events that could render the analysis moot.\n   - The analysis does not factor in depreciation, which would have a major impact on the value of the facility and the tax calculation.\n   - The assessment assumes no benefits to the city \u2013 in terms of jobs, tourism, or nearby development \u2013 to offset the purported $1 billion cost to taxpayers.\n   - The analysis doesn't account for the fact that the city would own the land and stadium, so Precourt Sports Ventures wouldn't pay any property taxes on the facility.\n\nTwo professors who study publicly funded economic incentives agree that the group's analysis is off base, with one calling the $1 billion amount \"crazy\" and the other saying it \"doesn\u2019t pass the sniff test.\" Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that city leaders are giving away $1 billion if they approve the stadium plan."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because while the claim states that Rick Scott cut education by over a billion dollars and thousands of teachers lost their jobs and class sizes went up, the evidence demonstrates that there is some confusion regarding the accuracy of these statements.\n\nThe evidence reveals that, indeed, a $1.3 billion cut to public schools occurred in 2011, but it does not provide a definitive source that shows the precise number of teacher layoffs statewide as a result of the budget cuts. The Crist campaign only cited an article about layoffs in a single school district (Broward), where approximately 868 teachers were affected by layoffs or not reappointed, with some being later rehired. This figure falls short of the \"thousands\" cited by the claim.\n\nRegarding class sizes, the evidence shows that changes made by the Legislature during Scott's tenure make it difficult to compare compliance rates from year to year. There was a small increase in the percentage of classes out of compliance from the last year of Crist to the first year of Scott, but the numbers went back down after that.\n\nIn summary, while it is undeniable that education funding was cut during Rick Scott's tenure and some teachers lost their jobs, the evidence does not support the claim that \"thousands\" of teachers were affected or that class sizes definitively increased across the state due to these budget cuts. Therefore, the claim can be seen as conflicting with the available evidence provided."

    "justification": "The label \"True\" is appropriate because the claim made by MJ Hegar that \"nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don\u2019t have access to health care insurance\" is substantiated by the evidence presented. According to the article, before the onset of the pandemic, approximately 4.8 million people under 65 were uninsured in Texas, which translates to about 19.9% or \"about 1 in 5 Texans.\" However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, two national studies estimated that between 650,000 and 1.6 million Texans could have lost their health insurance coverage, pushing the uninsured rate for people under 65 to approximately 26.5% or \"about 1 in 4\" if all those who lost coverage remain without it. The article also suggests that many of these individuals may become eligible for Medicaid due to unemployment benefits and the temporary $600 weekly payments approved by Congress, thus reducing the number of uninsured Texans slightly. However, another study estimated that about 659,000 adult workers in Texas who lost their jobs and couldn't find new coverage remained uninsured during the end of May, translating to a rate of 29%, or \"about 1 in 3 adults.\" Therefore, Hegar's claim can be seen as an upper bound estimate considering some people may regain insurance coverage over time. Overall, the evidence supports that the number of uninsured Texans has increased significantly during the pandemic and is closer to 1 in 3 than 1 in 5."

Although both Cox and Trump have stated that Congress must solve family separations, there is no evidence that Cox has replicated specific words or viewpoints of President Trump on this issue beyond the shared sentiment of blaming Congress. However, Newsom's statement creates the impression that Cox shares similar stances to those held by Trump regarding family separation. In this case, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because it reflects the discrepancy between Newsom's claim and the evidence provided, which shows that Cox has openly opposed family separations, contrary to the implication in Newsom's statement."

While it is stated that Wolfe's car made contact with student Jonathan Butler during the protest, it is also mentioned that the police and video footage do not suggest intentional running through or hitting of the students. Furthermore, Butler was not hospitalized as a result of the incident, and both he and Concerned Student 1950 did not respond to requests for comment regarding the nature of the contact. The incident is described as \"incidental contact\" by MU Police Major Brian Weimer, who also stated that it was closed without arrest or citation. It is also unclear whether Butler intentionally walked into the path of Wolfe's car, as some media outlets claim, and video evidence does not conclusively show this either. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is not possible to definitively determine whether Wolfe's car ran through the students or intentionally hit one of them."

Instead, the evidence shows that these analyses contain assumptions, speculations, and criticisms regarding Romney\u2019s proposed tax reforms, growth effects, and offsetting revenue losses.\n\nMoreover, some of the analyses presented in the article are from individuals affiliated with organizations that have a clear political bias towards Mitt Romney and his tax plan (such as Martin Feldstein, an adviser to the Romney campaign, and Curtis Dubay from the Heritage Foundation). Additionally, other analyses mentioned in the article were initially evaluated as \"Mostly False\" by fact-checkers due to double-counting or misrepresentation of research.\n\nTherefore, it is not accurate to assert that six studies verify the math behind Mitt Romney\u2019s tax plan, as the provided evidence does not present six independent and unbiased studies corroborating this claim.

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the claim states that President Barack Obama's health care law \"is expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs,\" while the evidence shows that the reduction in employment is primarily due to workers voluntarily choosing to work less, not because employers are laying off employees or eliminating jobs. The CBO report predicts a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers, but it does not suggest an increase in unemployment or underemployment, and it notes that total employment will still rise. This indicates that the claim oversimplifies the situation by implying that the Affordable Care Act is causing job losses through employer actions when, in reality, most of the reduction is due to workers choosing to work less. The evidence also demonstrates a difference of opinion between critics like Speaker Boehner and Democrats/liberal commentators regarding the interpretation of the CBO report, which adds to the label's appropriateness as conflicting."

    "justification": "Justification: The claim \"If labor force participation rate were the same as when Barack Obama became president, unemployment would be 11 percent\" is True, according to the provided evidence. This is because, as stated in the evidence, the labor force participation rate was 65.7% in January 2009 (when President Obama took office) and 63.8% in May 2012. Given these rates and the total population for each year, it was calculated that if the labor force participation rate remained at the level of January 2009, there would be approximately 4.6 million more people participating in the workforce than in May 2012. This increase in labor force participants would result in an additional 12.7 million (the actual unemployment count for May 2012) becoming unemployed, leading to a general unemployment rate of around 11% (17.3 million unemployed divided by the hypothetical larger labor force). This calculation aligns with the original claim, making it True."

According to the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, ERCOT manages 90% of the electrical load of Texas; it is a nonprofit corporation. The ERCOT report states that \"energy costs for customers may increase by up to 16% by 2030 due to the CPP alone,\" not every year until 2030 as claimed in the statement.

This is because the evidence provided indicates that while it is true that Americans spend a significant amount on tax compliance costs, the specific figure of $500 billion per year is not accurate.\n\nThe evidence explains that the estimate of $107 billion in 2005 for tax compliance costs was given by Michael Brostek of the General Accountability Office (GAO). Adjusted for inflation, this would have been nearly $172 billion a year around the time Senator Ted Cruz spoke in 2014. This is significantly lower than the claimed $500 billion.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence mentions that Senator Ted Cruz's campaign spokesman Rick Tyler stated that Cruz drew on a chart posted by The Washington Post in 2012 indicating that adjusted for inflation, defense spending has exceeded $500 billion a year since 2007 or so. If we take this into account, it is clear that the military budget indeed far exceeds the estimated tax compliance costs.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the claim is False as it significantly overestimates the amount spent on tax compliance."

However, there is no direct quote from Huber explicitly saying \"Don't build\" the road. Rather, she has expressed concerns about the cost-benefit analysis of the project, its impact on traffic congestion, and environmental issues, and she has advocated for other projects to be prioritized first. Although Huber has not stated \"Don't build it,\" her actions against the project could be interpreted as implicitly suggesting that the construction should be delayed or reconsidered until certain concerns are addressed.

The increase in employment during September 1983 was due to the return of 675,000 telephone workers who went on strike at the beginning of August and approved a contract by the end of the month. This surge in employment after the strike resolution does not represent new jobs created but rather employees returning to their positions following the dispute. Therefore, it is misleading to assert that President Reagan oversaw a single month with 1 million job creations as stated in the claim."

Specifically, the evidence reveals that the average annual number of prosecutions under the Bush administration (105) is higher than the average annual number of prosecutions under Obama's administration (61).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the Obama administration only has two years of data available for comparison, while the Bush administration has six years. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that enforcement of these offenses has historically been low due to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms viewing these violations as less important compared to other cases.\n\nGiven this context, it's not accurate to claim that there is a 40% decrease in federal prosecutions for lying on background checks under President Obama without also acknowledging the historically low rate of enforcement and the incomplete data available for comparison.

    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim \"Under President Barack Obama, 'more Americans are in poverty ... than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping records on it over 50 years ago'\" is labeled as conflicting because while the statement made by Newt Gingrich that \"More Americans are in poverty today than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping records on it over 50 years ago\" is technically accurate according to the U.S. Census Bureau statistics, it fails to provide a complete and fair context for the given claim.\n\nThe evidence provided shows that while the absolute number of people in poverty in 2010 (46.1 million) was indeed at its highest since records began in 1959, Gingrich ignored population growth over this period. The U.S. population has increased by 73% between 1959 and 2010. Therefore, if one takes into account the percentage of people in poverty relative to the total population (the poverty rate), it was lower in 2010 (15.1%) than during any year from 1959 to 1965, when the poverty rate was higher every year. This paints a somewhat different picture than what Gingrich suggested and undermines his claim that poverty under President Obama was at an all-time high.\n\nAdditionally, while Gingrich's statement implies that the high poverty rates during the Obama administration were solely due to the president's policies, the evidence suggests that this is an oversimplification. The historical record shows us that the deeper the recession, the stronger the recovery. However, the U.S. was still in the early stages of recovery from the Great Recession when the poverty statistics were reported, which complicates the causal relationship between the administration's policies and high poverty rates.\n\nTherefore, while Gingrich's statement is technically correct, it is misleading because it fails to provide a complete and fair context for the claim and oversimplifies the complex interplay of factors contributing to high poverty rates during the Obama administration. Thus, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this statement."

According to the article, Hillary Clinton's campaign stated that she was referring to her first 18 months as Secretary of State (January 2009 to June 2010). During this time, it is established that U.S. and global sanctions against Iran increased significantly, with the United Nations Security Council approving tough new sanctions in June 2010. The article also notes that Clinton played a major role in this development through diplomatic lobbying efforts to persuade other countries to join the U.S. plan to pressure Iran, overcoming hurdles such as getting Russia and China on board. Furthermore, Clinton appointed a special adviser to oversee U.S. efforts related to sanctions against Iran, and experts agree that she deserves credit for the rapid increase in international sanctions. These sanctions were a key factor in pushing Iran back to multilateral talks about its nuclear program, according to Patrick Clawson, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Clinton's claim is essentially correct and she did spend 18 months putting together sanctions against Iran to force them to the negotiating table."

The evidence shows that George Tenet, the head of the CIA, stated that \"the system was blinking red\" in the months leading up to the attacks, but the danger was considered to be outside America's borders, and there was a consensus among intelligence agencies that the target lay elsewhere. The closest the intelligence came to predicting what actually took place was an unconfirmed warning from May suggesting a group of al-Qaeda supporters were in the U.S. planning attacks with explosives, but this did not specify a location or time. Furthermore, interviews with George W. Bush as part of the commission's investigation revealed that he did not consider the August 6 briefing document, which mentioned al-Qaeda's desire to attack the United States directly and surveillance of federal buildings in New York, as containing actionable intelligence. The commission's report also states that these findings led to no meetings of the interagency Counterterrorism Security Group or the National Security Council to discuss a domestic attack, and Tenet himself did not remember talking to Bush about a domestic threat before September 11. Therefore, it is inaccurate to claim that Tenet warned the Bush administration of an imminent attack on U.S. soil."

Bill Young voted against a bill (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act), it was not accurate to characterize this vote as opposition to a $716 billion cut in the traditional sense. The evidence indicates that the reduction in Medicare costs referred to here is a result of changes made to slow the growth of Medicare costs, primarily affecting insurance companies and hospitals rather than beneficiaries. The $716 billion figure refers to savings achieved over a specific period (2013-2022) as determined by the Congressional Budget Office. However, it was not known at the time of the health care vote that this exact amount would be realized, and the nature of the reductions were not targeted at beneficiaries or Medicare spending in the same way a traditional cut might imply. This mischaracterization of the nature of the cost reduction and Young's opposition to it creates a conflicting statement."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for the claim that the president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border, because the evidence shows that while the law did direct the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along the border with Mexico and specified \"at least two layers of reinforced fencing\" in certain segments, it did not require a fence to be built \"along the entire Mexican border.\" The law gave discretion to the Department of Homeland Security to decide what type of fencing was appropriate in different areas, and while a significant amount of fencing has been constructed, it is not double-layered as called for in the 2006 law, and only a small fraction of the fence is double-layered pedestrian fence. The claim is conflicting because while the fence construction is in progress, it is not in full compliance with the original requirements of the 2006 law that called for a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border."

While it is true that Texas had a high number of overdose deaths (3,000 in 2017), which is an example of related mayhem to drug trafficking, Sen. Cornyn's tweet did not include the additional context from his hearing statement that Texas is one of the states most severely impacted \"in terms of volume of trafficking and all related mayhem.\" This omission could lead to a misunderstanding about what the claim refers to specifically, as the tweet only mentions overdose deaths.\n   The article also indicates that when considering drug overdose deaths per capita in 2017, Texas ranks near the bottom of states, suggesting that it might not be one of the most severely impacted when accounting for population size.

The evidence confirms that France indeed gets a significant portion (72-78%) of its electricity from nuclear power plants, as indicated by various sources such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Nuclear Association.\n\nRegarding the beef importation part of the claim, while it is mentioned that the entire European Union has banned imports of beef produced with growth hormones for nearly three decades, and France is part of this EU, there is evidence that France still imports beef not produced with growth hormones. However, the article does not provide specific numbers or percentages to definitively conclude whether France imports a significant amount of Texas beef or not. Hence, it cannot be confirmed with absolute certainty if France \"wouldn\u2019t buy Texas beef\", but it can be inferred that they do import beef from other sources.\n\nGiven these findings, it is accurate to say that the claim about nuclear power consumption by France (76%) is true, while the claim about France's refusal to buy Texas beef is partially true, with insufficient evidence to confirm or deny it entirely."

This is substantiated by the article which details how, during President Bill Clinton's administration in 1993, Hillary Clinton led a task force to reform the health industry. The goal was to provide universal coverage, and this could be achieved, according to the Clintons, by requiring all employers to provide insurance to workers (an employer mandate), rather than instituting an individual mandate or a broad-based tax similar to Medicare. This is further supported by numerous news accounts from 1993 and Clinton's own testimony on the Hill, where she defended this plan before congressional committees. Furthermore, the article also mentions that Clinton considered an employer mandate as her preferred method for achieving universal coverage over an individual mandate. Therefore, it is accurate to say that Hillary Clinton opposed an individual mandate and favored an employer mandate back in 1993."

The evidence shows that there were also significant job losses among whites during the same period, suggesting that broader economic conditions may have played a role.\n   Furthermore, the claim ignores the efforts made by the Obama administration to address unemployment, particularly among black Americans, as well as the stalling of bills aimed at creating jobs in Congress. The NAACP, an organization representing the interests of African-Americans, does not blame President Obama for the high rate of unemployment among blacks.\n   Additionally, the claim overlooks the role corporations play in hiring decisions and the economy's overall stability during a recession or weak economic recovery. Placing sole blame on President Obama for job losses among black Americans is an oversimplification that ignores complex economic factors and policy considerations.\n   In conclusion, the evidence demonstrates that while job losses among black Americans occurred under President Obama's tenure, attributing these losses directly to him without considering other relevant factors and policy efforts is a conflicting interpretation of the data."

Moreover, as the article notes, these projections did not materialize due to various reasons, including economic downturns and policy changes.\n\nTherefore, while Kasich's claim might have been technically accurate if referring to a projected surplus, it is misleading to state that \"when I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus\" without qualifying the statement as a projection rather than an actual surplus in hand at the time.

The evidence shows that during the August primary election, a political action committee called Jobs and Opportunity, which is affiliated with the Democratic Governors Association (and therefore part of Obama's political machine), made an in-kind contribution valued at over $1 million to the campaign of Chris Koster, who won the Democratic primary for governor. This contribution coincided with a series of television ads attacking Greitens that were paid for by Jobs and Opportunity. Therefore, it is accurate to say that the Democratic Governors Association and Obama's political machine spent $1 million against Eric Greitens in the Republican primary election. The evidence also shows that this contribution was made just before the primary election, as Greitens claimed. Furthermore, although the political action committee acted independently from Koster\u2019s campaign, Koster's campaign had some knowledge of the ad before it aired, as reported by the Missouri Ethics Commission.

According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the unemployment rate for Shelby County in January 2007 (when Cohen officially took office) was either 5.5% or 5.7%, depending on the source of the data. This is a significant difference from the 4.8% mentioned in the claim. The evidence also indicates that the current unemployment rate in Shelby County is 8.4%, not 9.7%.

    "justification": "The claim \"We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977\" can be considered true because the evidence provides data from a key employment statistic known as the civilian labor force participation rate, which is at its lowest level since the 1970s. This metric measures the number of Americans in the labor force (employed or seeking employment) divided by the total civilian population. When this percentage is low, it suggests that there are fewer working Americans supporting non-working Americans, as mentioned in the evidence. However, it's important to note that the aging of the Baby Boomer generation and the Great Recession have contributed to this decline in the labor force participation rate. Yet, another statistic, the employment-population ratio, shows a different picture; it has actually been improving in recent years, although it is below its pre-recession highs. This data contradicts the claim that we have the lowest percentage of Americans working since 1977 if we consider the employment-population ratio, but not when referring to the labor force participation rate as stated in the evidence."

This supports the claim that government's support for R&D has fallen significantly since the 1960s. The decrease is described as \"nearly two-thirds\" which may be slightly less than exactly two-thirds but still represents a substantial reduction in government funding for R&D. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim based on the evidence presented."

This means both politicians have shown strong loyalty to their respective parties, which contradicts Guinta's claim of taking on both parties and having independent values.\n\nFurthermore, the article mentions that city-level policymaking tends to be less shaped by national political partisanship than Congress, suggesting that Guinta's claims about his supposed independence might not hold true when considering his voting record in Congress. Therefore, it is not accurate for the claim to portray Shea-Porter as consistently voting with Pelosi's Democrats and Guinta as an independent politician with a record of taking on both parties. The evidence presented shows that their partisan voting patterns are much more similar than suggested by the claim.

For example, the United States' percentage growth rate is lower than several other countries on the list provided, such as Australia, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Iceland, Israel, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, and Switzerland.

This contradicts the claim that the proportion reached its highest point in 20 years. Furthermore, the evidence shows that an individual can be counted more than once each year depending on how many times they have been admitted for treatment, which could potentially skew the data and make comparisons over time problematic. The U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration directly stated that their data, known as the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), do not support the assertion that the number of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment has reached its highest point in 20 years.

Instead, his mention of bin Laden is found in a broader context discussing the U.S.'s unfocused national security policy and its response to terrorism during that time. The evidence also indicates that Trump did not make the claim about predicting bin Laden in his 2000 book at the specific rally mentioned, as he only described China's emergence as an economic power as \"the greatest long-term challenge\" facing the U.S. and North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions as the biggest short-term \"menace.\" The claim seems to be conflicting with what is actually stated in Trump's 2000 book."

However, this group was not included in the overall percentage (75%) Rubio and the Washington Examiner cited.

The article also cites a study from the Center for Immigration Studies that pegged Bush's support among Hispanics at 57% in 2002, which is still higher than his percentage of white votes.\n\nThe claim that Jeb Bush won more Hispanic votes than Anglo (white) votes in 2002 with 60% of the Hispanic vote compared to the white vote percentage can be seen as accurate based on the provided evidence."

    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "Justification: The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because while David Dewhurst claims to have cut taxes 63 times, including a significant property tax reduction in 2006, the article provides evidence suggesting that the overall level of taxes paid by Texans was relatively consistent during his tenure as lieutenant governor. Additionally, it appears that not all of the tax cuts were broad-based, and some were accompanied by tax increases. Furthermore, the article questions the accuracy of Dewhurst's claim regarding the magnitude of the 2006 property tax reduction, suggesting that it may have been overstated. Therefore, the statement can be seen as conflicting with available data and evidence regarding Texas taxation during Dewhurst's tenure as lieutenant governor."

    "original_label": "True",
    "justification": "The claim \"Says Erv Nelson voted 'yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country'\" is true because the article clearly states that \"The accusation leads back to a resolution approved by bipartisan majorities in both houses of the Legislature in 2015: Senate Joint Resolution 21. Nelson voted for the resolution, while Seaman and 10 other Assembly Republicans voted 'no.'\" The text also explains that SJR 21 \"urged Congress to take up the issue, and to include 'earned legal residency accompanied by a clear path to citizenship'\". Therefore, it is accurate to state that Erv Nelson did vote for a bill that supported a pathway to citizenship. While the label \"pro-amnesty\" is subjective due to differing opinions on the definition of amnesty in immigration policy, the article also acknowledges that the use of this term can be contentious and difficult to define. However, the resolution does advocate for citizenship for those residing illegally in the country, which could be interpreted as a form of amnesty, even if the specific label is debatable."

Firstly, Facebook users flagged the post as potentially fabricated, indicating suspicions of its accuracy. Secondly, while staffers were removed from the White House, this occurred nearly a year ago and not in response to an FBI raid as the headline suggests. Thirdly, the story attributed much of its information to Western Journalism, a conservative news source, yet it originated from an article in Politico. The headline dramatizes the actual event by using the term \"raid,\" which is misleading as there was no armed storming of the White House involved. Instead, the staffers were escorted out for failing background investigations, as reported by Politico and later Western Journalism. Therefore, it is appropriate to label this claim as False."

This publication defines a bipartisan bill as one that receives support from at least 50% of both parties, which would be at least 121 votes from Republicans and 85 votes from Democrats in the House of Representatives. However, only six bills out of the 42 identified by Guinta's office received this level of bipartisan support.

    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that \"President Barack Obama 'has an Environmental Protection Agency proposal that would raise the price of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon'\" is labeled as False. This is because the evidence provided in the article indicates that while there is a proposed EPA regulation aimed at reducing tailpipe emissions, the increase in gas prices due to this proposal has been estimated to be between 12 to 25 cents per gallon by an industry-sponsored study conducted by Baker & O'Brien. However, it was also mentioned that this estimate is based on assumptions about changes in both sulfur content and Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), a measure of fuel volatility.\n\nAt the time of writing the article, the EPA had not made its intentions clear regarding RVP, which constitutes a significant part of the estimated costs in the Baker & O'Brien study. Furthermore, it was pointed out that the study did not distinguish the costs of reducing the sulfur content from the costs of adjusting RVP.\n\nIn light of these findings, the 25-cent figure may not accurately represent the increase in gas prices due to the proposed EPA regulation. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the original claim is False as it overstates the expected increase in gasoline prices."

The supporting article indicates that there will be a disruption in health insurance for approximately 420,000 Floridians due to insurance companies withdrawing from the marketplace in Florida, but it also mentions that 15 insurance companies have filed requests to sell individual coverage plans in Florida, and many of those who lose their current plan will be able to switch to a new one. The statement's claim is an overstatement as it suggests all these people (over half a million) will lose their coverage, while the evidence indicates that most will retain some level of coverage but may need to switch insurers or adjust their plans. Furthermore, the article also emphasizes that a significant portion of Americans still get their insurance through their employer and not the individual marketplace, which further complicates the claim about losing coverage."

The article acknowledges some potential for people to lose access to their doctors due to changes in plans offered on the exchanges, but it also states that this will depend on various factors such as which companies participate in the exchange, geography, and consumer choices, making it difficult to predict the number of people who might be affected.\n\nAdditionally, the article points out that there is already a possibility for people to change their doctors due to factors such as employers switching health care plans, which was already happening before Obamacare. Thus, the claim is not clearly supported by the evidence presented and can be seen as conflicting or misleading as it implies that Obamacare specifically causes people to lose access to their doctors, when in reality, this is something that has always been a possibility due to various factors outside of Obamacare."

Although the study used by Romney during the debate found that about 40 percent of job growth in Texas since 2007 went to newly arrived illegal immigrants, it did not conclude that these jobs were \"created for\" them. Rather, the report indicated that employers filled these positions with illegal immigrants who ended up taking them. The evidence also shows that there are significant methodological problems with the study, such as small sample sizes and assumptions about the percentage of immigrants who are illegal. Furthermore, both the 40 percent figure and the more accurate net immigration figure (27 percent) have a wide margin of error, which calls into question the accuracy of Romney's statement.

Furthermore, another example is the case of Dylan O'Riordan, a then-19-year-old man from Ireland who was detained and scheduled for deportation by ICE in January 2018.

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because while Santorum claims that the federal government tells health insurance companies how much money they're allowed to keep (15 percent), the evidence shows that this claim oversimplifies the situation. The medical loss ratio provision requires insurers to spend a certain percentage of their premium income on healthcare claims and quality improvement, but it does not restrict the proportion of overall revenue that insurance companies can retain. This means that other sources of revenue besides premiums can be used for administrative expenses, marketing, and profit. Therefore, Santorum's statement suggests a greater level of government control than is actually in place, which makes his claim conflicting with the reality presented in the evidence."

    "justification": "The claim states that \"Teacher pay has increased under Republican leadership every year for the past 5 years.\" To determine if this claim is true or not, we need to compare the teacher salaries from the past five years and check for an increase each year.\n\n   According to the evidence provided, the average teacher salary for the past five years is as follows: 2013-14: $44,990, 2014-15: $47,819, 2015-16: $47,985, 2016-17: $49,837, and 2017-18: $50,861.\n\n   We can see that the teacher salaries increased each year from 2013-14 to 2017-18. However, in the evidence, it is also stated that the salary for teachers with 35 years of experience dropped from $52,150 in 2013-14 to $51,300 in 2017-18 due to a \"Held Harmless\" statute. But this does not negate the overall increase in teacher pay as the salaries of other teachers did increase every year and there were teachers who experienced a salary increase within those years.\n\n   The evidence also provides us with the ranking of North Carolina for teacher pay increases, which was second nationally in 2016-17, according to the National Education Association. This further supports the claim that teacher pay increased under Republican leadership every year for the past 5 years.\n\n   Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim as there is substantial evidence to support that teacher pay has indeed increased under Republican leadership every year for the past 5 years."

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data show that in 2013, about 8.85 million policyholders received rebates totaling $1.1 billion. Although not all of these rebates were in the form of physical checks, they served as a refund to consumers either directly or indirectly (through reduced premiums).

However, this does not negate the accuracy of the specific claim about half of the responding CEOs expressing negative views on hiring plans due to the shutdown and its threat. Additionally, the evidence presents an expert opinion from the National Federation of Independent Businesses that suggests similar sentiments among small business owners regarding pessimism about business conditions over the next six months, albeit without specific focus on delaying employment.

The supporting article shows that the claimant, Ben Shapiro, used a broad definition of 'radical' and took the highest percentages available in surveys to maximize the number of Muslims he could tag with this label, which leads to an inflated estimate of radicalized Muslims.\n\n2. In several countries assessed by Shapiro, support for Sharia law does not necessarily equate to support for violent or extremist actions, yet Shapiro assumes otherwise and considers any support for Sharia as a sign of radicalism. However, the article provides examples where more detailed polling data shows a more nuanced picture, changing the results significantly.\n\n3. The article also highlights that when Muslim populations are asked about specific elements in Sharia law, such as corporal punishments or the death penalty for apostates, support drops off considerably, suggesting that the blanket assumption of radicalism based on support for Sharia is not accurate.\n\n4. By applying different but reasonable criteria to the same data, vastly different results can be reached. For example, when looking at support for suicide bombings against civilians, a more appropriate measure of radicalism, the number of radical Muslims in Pakistan decreases dramatically.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence provided demonstrates that the claimant's methodology is flawed and lacks accuracy in determining the number of 'radicalized' Muslims, making the label 'False' appropriate for this claim."

The evidence provided demonstrates that not all the money spent under the stimulus program went towards funding government employees or creating \"make-work\" jobs, and even for the portion that did fund government jobs, many of those jobs were not \"make work.\"\n\nThe evidence shows that over 2/3 of the total stimulus spending (tax benefits to individuals and businesses, and entitlement payments) cannot be categorized as funding \"make-work\" government jobs since they were payments and tax givebacks for individuals and businesses to spend as they saw fit. The remaining portion that did fund contracts, grants, and loans included a sizable chunk of money used by the government to fund work carried out by the private sector rather than the federal government itself.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence indicates that the size of the federal workforce has declined since Obama took office, with only a 3% increase over a five-year period if the figures excluding the Postal Service are used. This contradicts the claim that President Obama created \"nearly a trillion dollars\" worth of make-work government jobs.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence demonstrates that not all the government employees engaged in \"make work,\" as defined by Webster's New World Dictionary, since much of the funding went towards keeping previously employed educators from being laid off or for educating disadvantaged and special-needs children, which seems hard to characterize their duties as \"make work.\"\n\nFinally, the evidence reveals that Republicans have offered a revised phrase, \"government-facilitated job growth,\" to replace \"make-work government jobs\" in their claim. This terminology is more accurate and less misleading since it acknowledges that some job creation did occur as a result of the stimulus program, albeit not to the extent claimed by the original statement. Therefore, the original claim can be labeled as False."

    "justification": "The claim \"AARP endorsed Biden and says if you are past 75 you should just die and go away\" can be labeled as False because the evidence presented clearly shows that AARP does not endorse political candidates, including Joe Biden. AARP is a nonpartisan organization advocating for Americans aged 50 and older.\n\nThe claim that AARP supports the notion that life past 75 isn't worth living is also unfounded. The evidence reveals that AARP has been actively advocating against policies that might discriminate or ration care based on age or disability, including during the COVID-19 pandemic when such claims were particularly widespread. This stance highlights AARP's commitment to upholding the rights and dignity of older adults.\n\nIn addition, there is no evidence presented in the claim to support the statement that AARP has said people aged 75 and above should just die and go away. The evidence provided instead shows that AARP has been working to protect the rights of older Americans, opposing rationing based on age or disability, and advocating for policies that prevent COVID-19 spread among those most at risk, including the elderly.\n\nIn summary, the claim is False because it contradicts AARP's actions and statements, as presented in the evidence, which demonstrate AARP's ongoing efforts to protect the rights, dignity, and wellbeing of older Americans."

    "taxonomy_label": "comparison",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that Donald Trump has never been accused of being racist until he ran against the Democrats is false because there have been numerous instances and accusations of racism against him dating back over three decades before his political career, as evidenced in the New York Times article from 1973 where he was charged with discriminating against blacks in apartment rentals. Additionally, the Department of Justice sued Trump Management Corporation for violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and refusing to rent or negotiate rentals because of race and color. Moreover, in 1989, Trump ran an advertisement calling for the death penalty for black suspects in the Central Park jogger case, which was criticized as a \"thinly veiled racist polemic\" by two black ministers. Furthermore, there have been numerous accounts of Trump's alleged racism from employees and associates, such as Kip Brown who stated that he was told to remove all black people from the floor when Donald and Ivana Trump visited Atlantic City casinos in the 1980s. The evidence presented demonstrates a consistent pattern of accusations and incidents involving racial discrimination against Donald Trump over a long period, making the claim false."

    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because while Jeb Bush's claim of reducing heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent can be numerically supported using the 2006 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey, there are several factors that suggest caution when interpreting this statistic.\n\nFirstly, the percentage of youth using heroin is relatively small, making year-to-year differences potentially unreliable. The survey itself acknowledges this limitation, stating that analyses attempting to quantify changes over time are subject to error due to the extremely low prevalence rates associated with heroin use by Florida students.\n\nSecondly, the biggest drop in heroin use occurred between 2000 and 2001, a single-year decline which seems unusual according to experts. This could be due to methodological differences in data collection, such as the change in the timing of surveys, but it remains a point of curiosity that requires further investigation.\n\nLastly, despite Bush's policies receiving praise for their contribution to drug policy in Florida, it is unclear whether they had a significant role in engineering the observed decline in heroin use among youth. Experts suggest that broader issues such as demographic and social trends may have had a larger impact during this period.\n\nGiven these concerns and uncertainties, it would be prudent to take Bush's claim with a grain of salt rather than accepting it at face value. Hence, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate for this case."

This conclusion is appropriate based on the evidence provided, which states that while the bill did propose sweeping changes in refugee identification and admission, it did not grant \"blanket authority\" to President Obama to admit refugees without any background checks. Furthermore, the bill specifically stated that all refugees would still be subject to background checks, albeit without explicitly mandating specific check procedures. The evidence shows that Presidential power regarding refugee admission was not altered significantly by the Gang of Eight bill and the claims suggesting otherwise are inaccurate."

Although the claim could be considered slightly misleading due to its phrasing, as it suggests that the surplus years were exclusively a result of the act and Gingrich's actions during his speakership, the evidence indicates otherwise. The article clarifies that while Gingrich played a role in shaping budgets for the first two years of the four consecutive surplus years, he was no longer speaker by the time the other two surpluses were achieved. The article also acknowledges that economic growth and factors outside of specific legislation contributed significantly to balancing the federal budget. However, since the claim focuses on the achievement of four consecutive balanced budgets and not specifically Gingrich's role in achieving them, the label True is appropriate based on the evidence provided."

This legislation was aimed at creating and saving jobs.

    "justification": "The claim that \"Massachusetts has three state-mandated student tests and Finland just one\" can be labeled as conflicting because the article provides evidence that supports both sides of the statement.\n\nOn one hand, the evidence indicates that Massachusetts does have three state-mandated high school tests in English language arts, math, and a science-oriented subject. However, the evidence also states that students in Massachusetts from grades three through eight must take standardized state exams as well. These additional exams would increase the total number of state-mandated tests in Massachusetts beyond the claim's assertion of three.\n\nOn the other hand, the evidence for Finland shows that there is indeed one major exam at the end of high school students' senior year, known as the Finnish Matriculation Exam. However, the article also states that this exam consists of a minimum of four tests, and students may choose to take more than four tests if they wish. This information suggests that Finland does have more than one state-mandated student test, contradicting the claim that Finland has just one such test.\n\nTherefore, due to conflicting evidence presented in the article, it can be concluded that the claim \"Massachusetts has three state-mandated student tests and Finland just one\" is not entirely accurate or consistent with the information provided in the evidence."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the claim states that there is a \"traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees,\" while the evidence shows that this is not the case. The article explains that while some Senate Democrats, including Senator Maggie Hassan, have claimed that Supreme Court nominees need a 60-vote threshold to be confirmed, this is not supported by historical data or by the actual procedure for confirming a Supreme Court nominee.\n\nThe evidence demonstrates that in reality, a Supreme Court Justice nominee only needs a simple majority vote (51 votes) to be confirmed by the Senate. This is evident from the experiences of Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who were both confirmed with less than 60 votes, as well as the voting records of Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who were confirmed with more than 51 votes but without any 60-vote cloture motion being required.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence shows that a 60-vote threshold is not even a traditional practice for Supreme Court nominations. The article explains that filibustering a Supreme Court nominee and taking a cloture vote is far from \"traditional\" in Supreme Court nominations, having only happened four times in modern history.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there is a \"traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees\" conflicts with the facts presented in the evidence."

    "justification": "The claim \"In Rhode Island, a recent study showed that among a group of people who had been homeless for a year or more, Medicaid costs averaged about $60,000 per person\" is labeled as False because the evidence provided shows that this is an inaccurate statement. The report referenced by Anne Nolan, the head of Rhode Island's largest homeless shelter, actually stated that among long-term homeless people on Medicaid, the total charges for 67 individuals with the highest bills were $9,325,375 over a 28-month period. When calculated per person per year, this amounts to $10,795, which is far less than $60,000 and more closely resembles the average for all Medicaid recipients in Rhode Island. The misconception arises due to the confusion between total costs of the 67 high-cost users and average costs for all long-term homeless people on Medicaid, which were found to be $23,650 per person per year, according to another analysis from Eric Hirsch using the same data. Therefore, the statement is incorrect as it does not accurately represent the average Medicaid costs for the group of people described in the claim."

    "justification": "The claim \"In 2010, everybody said you can't dare let guns go into the national parks, and of course the rapes, murders, robberies and assaults are down about 85 percent since we did that\" is labeled as False because the evidence provided shows that the statement significantly overstates the decline in violent crimes on National Park Service land.\n\nThe evidence indicates that an analysis by Sen. Tom Coburn's office compared FBI crime data from 2008 to 2011, and based on this comparison, they reported a drop of 85% in violent incidents. However, upon further review of the actual data presented, it shows that the number of violent crimes decreased by 12%, not 85%. Moreover, the evidence clarifies that using 2008 as the \"before\" year for comparison is misleading because the law allowing guns in national parks was enacted in 2010. Comparing data from 2009 (the last full year before the gun ban was lifted) and 2011 would provide a more accurate representation of the change after the policy was implemented.\n\nIt is also important to consider that the overall crime rate in national parks is relatively low, which makes it challenging to draw firm conclusions based on percentage increases or decreases from year to year. Additionally, the article emphasizes that there is no definitive way to establish whether guns were a factor in the slight decrease between 2008 and 2011, nor can one determine if guns might have contributed to the increase in violent crimes from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim made by Sen. Tom Coburn regarding the significant decline in violent crimes on National Park Service land after allowing guns is false because it overstates the actual drop in violent incidents, misleadingly uses an inappropriate comparison year for the analysis, and fails to account for the many complexities surrounding crime statistics in national parks."

In some counties, like Harris County, an equal number of voting machines for each party was placed at every polling place, but longer lines were observed for Democratic voters due to a higher interest in the Democratic ballot and a larger number of Democratic voters in the county. In other counties like Tarrant County, a disproportionate number of voting machines were allocated to the Republican side based on past voter turnout data, leading to longer lines for Democratic voters. Therefore, the claim's assertion about an unequal distribution of voting machines cannot be universally applied across Texas during Super Tuesday polling."

The evidence states that the source of the claim was a database from 2007, and more recent data from 2013 presents a different picture.\n\nRegarding child marriage rates, the 2013 Demographic and Health Survey shows that 35.9 percent of Liberian women aged 20 to 24 reported being married by the time they were 18. This figure is fractionally lower than the female youth literacy rate of 64.2 percent in the same age group, according to the 2013 survey. Therefore, it cannot be asserted that a girl is more likely to be married by 18 than to know how to read based on this data.\n\nSimilarly, when considering literacy rates, the evidence shows that the 2013 survey reported a literacy rate of 64.2 percent for women between 15 and 24 years of age, with the literacy rate decreasing slightly to 58.9 percent when looking at women ages 20 to 24. This is significantly higher than the marriage figure of 35.9 percent reported from the same survey for the same age group.\n\nTherefore, the claim is conflicting because it is based on outdated data and presents an inaccurate representation of current conditions in Liberia regarding child marriage and literacy rates among girls and young women."

The article indicates that the recession, which coincided with the deepest losses of private-sector jobs in New Jersey, was not fully accounted for in Governor Chris Christie's statement. Additionally, it mentions the weak job growth preceding the recession and the loss of competitiveness of the state as factors that may have contributed to the job losses.

While it's true that the number of gun deaths reported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in 2013 was approximately 3,000 per month, the debate Hillary Clinton referred to took place in October 2015. The most recent CDC tally at the time was for the year 2013, and more recent data does not seem to exist.\n\nMoreover, the evidence suggests that the Gun Violence Archive's numbers, which are less comprehensive because they do not include suicides, are less than half of what the CDC counted in 2013. The archive will receive 2015 suicide data in about six months, and when that data is added, their total number of gun deaths could triple.\n\nFinally, while it's possible that the total for 2015 might be higher than 2013 due to an increase in gun suicides and homicides, the evidence does not provide conclusive proof to support Hillary Clinton's claim.

The article states that the average property tax bill in 1999 was roughly $4,240 and by 2009 it had climbed to about $7,280, representing a 71.36% increase (($7,280 - $4,240) / $4,240). The article also acknowledges that when rebates are factored in, the increase over the decade before Christie took office is less than 70%, but it remains significantly greater than 0%.

However, when discussing the speed at which these layoffs were carried out, there seems to be a discrepancy.\n\nIn the attack ad by Sen.

The evidence states that Fiorina was discussing her regrets about the speed at which she dismissed certain high-ranking executives, not the overall layoff process. This leaves room for interpretation and potential confusion about whether she specifically meant the 30,000 layoffs when she said she would have done them \"faster.\"\n\nTherefore, it is essential to consider both context and specificity when evaluating Fiorina's statement, which leads to the label of \"Conflicting\" being appropriate."

The evidence presents two different measures used by the state: one considers an F grade, while the other incorporates both F and D grades that did not meet their expected growth goals.\n\nAccording to the article, only 146 schools received an F grade, which is far from the claimed number of 500 failing schools. However, the state's law defines a \"low-performing\" school as one receiving either an F or D grade that did not meet its expected growth goals, and there are 547 such schools according to this definition.\n\nThe label \"failing\" is often understood to mean a school receiving an F grade. However, Donald Bryson, the North Carolina director of Americans For Prosperity, used the term \"low-performing\" to include D schools that did not meet their growth goals as well. This broader definition seems to be at odds with the common understanding of \"failing,\" which can lead to confusion and conflicting interpretations.\n\nIn addition, it is pointed out in the evidence that if a traditional grading scale were used, many more schools would receive an F grade due to North Carolina's unique grading system. This further complicates the assessment of whether there are 500 failing schools in North Carolina as claimed by Bryson.\n\nTo clarify the claim and determine its validity, it is essential to reconcile these different definitions and criteria used to identify \"failing\" schools in North Carolina. Without this clarification, the claim remains conflicting because it is based on two distinct, potentially inconsistent definitions of a \"failing\" school."

The claim also correctly identifies these two counties as being within New Hampshire's second congressional district."

    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim states that Donald Trump won 66 out of 67 counties in Florida during the Republican presidential primary in an unprecedented fashion, which had never happened before. However, the evidence presented shows that previous elections have had instances where a candidate won all or nearly all of the counties in Florida. For instance, in 2004, John Kerry won all 67 counties for the Democrats, and in 1980, Jimmy Carter won 100% of the counties for the Democrats. Furthermore, there are instances where candidates have split the state but still managed to win a large number of counties. For example, in 2012, both Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich split the state, yet Trump's claim implies that he was the first to win such a vast majority of counties. Therefore, the label \"False\" is appropriate because the evidence demonstrates that Trump did not achieve an unprecedented win in terms of winning all but one county in Florida. Instead, his win can be considered typical when compared to historical elections in Florida."

    "taxonomy_label": "interval",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the claim made by Mitt Romney in his speech during the 2012 fundraiser, that \"the president has been a disappointment. He told you he'd keep unemployment below 8 percent,\" conflicts with the actual statements and projections from President Obama and his advisers. The evidence shows that President Obama did not explicitly promise to keep unemployment below 8 percent; rather, economic advisors projected that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan might reduce unemployment to peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. This projection was subject to a significant margin of error and varied substantially from other private forecasters' predictions. Additionally, it is important to note that the unemployment rate exceeded 8 percent at some point during Obama's presidency. Thus, Romney's claim presents an oversimplification or misinterpretation of what was originally stated by President Obama and his advisers."

    "justification": "Justification: The claim that \"Says 'right now, we have more military spending than the next 10, 11, 12 countries combined'\" is true, as supported by the evidence presented in the article. The evidence cites data from two leading authorities on worldwide military spending \u2013 the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). According to SIPRI's data, the United States spent $711 billion on defense in 2011, which accounted for 41% of the world total. Meanwhile, the next top 12 spending nations combined only accounted for $670.9 billion, making the United States' military spending more than those of the next 10, 11, or 12 countries combined. Similarly, IISS data also showed that the United States' defense budget in 2011 was $739.3 billion, with the combined total of the next top 9 nations amounting to only $486.7 billion. Therefore, it is clear that the claim made by Newark Mayor Cory Booker is validated by the evidence provided, demonstrating that the United States does indeed spend more on its military than the next 10, 11, or 12 countries combined."

The current debt is not the same as the original debt from 1917. Therefore, we are not currently paying interest on the World War I-era debt.

Additionally, a review of data on borrowing by the other 49 states along with Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands confirms that Missouri is indeed the only state to receive a loan from the federal government for the unemployment trust fund during the past five economic downturns.\n\nTherefore, it is accurate to say that Missouri has been the only state forced to borrow money from the federal government for unemployment benefits during each of the last five recessions as claimed in the statement.

The article states that Sink's role in managing finances does not extend to voting on bond issues or vetoing bond appropriations, which are decisions made by the legislature and the governor. Furthermore, the article points out that the entire U.S. economy was suffering during Sink's term as CFO, suggesting that the increase in Florida's debt is consistent with national trends rather than a direct result of Sink's actions. Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that Sink specifically supported a $5.2 billion increase in Florida's debt without qualification, as the evidence presented shows that her role in the increase was shared with other officials and influenced by broader economic factors."

    "justification": "The claim, \"Says under his utility rate plan, 'An estimated 50 percent of our residential households will see a decrease in their water and wastewater bills,'\" is labeled as True. This is appropriate because the evidence provided clearly supports this statement. According to the text, Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones's proposed utility rate plan halves the base rates for all customers and more than doubles a charge based on the amount of water used. Additionally, the text contains specific numbers that demonstrate the impact on the residential households. The Department of Public Utilities chart shows that about half of the city's 51,832 residential customers (25,904) were billed for using 400 cubic feet or less each month in the 2012 fiscal year. This means that these households will see lower bills under the new rates because their increase in the volume fee would be less than the savings they would get from the halving of the base rate. Consequently, the mayor's claim is accurate, as an estimated 50 percent of residential households will indeed see a decrease in their water and wastewater bills."

The article states that Maine passed a ballot initiative in 2016 to gradually raise the minimum wage for tipped workers until it reached $12 in 2024. However, by early 2017, restaurant workers had organized a campaign against the higher wage, arguing that it would decrease their tips due to customer reluctance to tip as much if they knew the worker was earning close to minimum wage. This organizing effort resulted in the Maine legislature passing a new law in June 2017, making the minimum wage for tipped workers half of the regular minimum wage. This demonstrates that the state did reverse its decision on the minimum wage for tipped workers due to restaurant employees organizing en masse against the measure, which is consistent with the claim made."

While it is true that Senator Dan Patrick stated in a video announcing his run for lieutenant governor that the state budget \"actually cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs,\" analysis of the 2014-15 budget shows an increase, not a decrease, in border spending of about $118 million. Furthermore, the evidence shows a drop in specific categories of DPS spending, but not overall border security spending when considering other agencies involved in border operations. The increase in border spending was a fiscal priority for Governor Rick Perry and the state's border security efforts have been ongoing since 2005. This conflicting information between Patrick's statement and the actual budget figures leads to the label of conflicting for the claim."

The PPIC report did not include final statewide violent crime data for 2015, and the preliminary statistics for January to June 2015 only covered about half of the state's population. Furthermore, the authors of the PPIC report never claimed that either the state or the sample of cities saw a 34 percent increase in violent crime; instead, they mentioned that 34 out of the 66 California cities saw a double-digit percentage increase in violent crimes. Lastly, the most recent full-year crime stats from 2014 put California's violent crime rate at a 47-year low, according to the PPIC, which contradicts the claim that there has been an increase within the last year. Therefore, it is evident that Sundheim made an error in his statement and misrepresented the data provided by the PPIC."

While Kander provides sources and quotations, the Congressional Research Service report suggests that it cannot be definitively stated whether members would have voted against a pay increase if given the opportunity during some years. This means the claim may not be completely accurate for those specific years.\n\n2. In some instances, Blunt voted to order the previous question before an amendment to stop the pay increase could be proposed, but it cannot be said with certainty that he would have voted against a pay increase if given the chance during these years.\n\n3. Blunt did vote in favor of ordering the previous question every year from 1999 through 2007, which indirectly led to pay increases for members of Congress. However, in some cases, representatives made clear their intention to introduce a pay freeze before the vote to order the previous question was taken.\n\n4. In 2009, Blunt voted against a provision that would have prohibited the automatic pay adjustment for 2010; however, his salary did not increase due to another vote he made in relation to an omnibus appropriations act. This year's vote Kander claims as a vote to increase Blunt\u2019s pay is from the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, which froze federal civilian employee salaries for two years but indirectly affects Congressional pay adjustments due to the 1989 ethics reform bill.\n\n5. Kander's claim that a vote against this bill in 2010 is a vote to increase Blunt\u2019s pay may be an overreach, as it could be more accurate to say that he voted to protect Congressional pay increases, though it remains a stretch.\n\nOverall, the provided evidence indicates that there are instances where Blunt's actions indirectly led to pay increases but not explicit votes in favor of raising his own salary. This creates a conflict with Kander's claim that Blunt \"voted to raise his own pay 12 times.\""

While it is true that the number of teachers decreased under Christie's administration (by approximately 4,500), it is not clear whether all of these reductions were due to layoffs (as claimed by Steve Wollmer) or a combination of layoffs and retirements. Additionally, there is no hard data presented in the evidence to support the claim that 6,000 teachers were fired specifically, and Ed Schultz's assertion on his show is not corroborated by the available data from the New Jersey Education Department. Moreover, the evidence also suggests that other factors, such as budget cuts made by both Christie and the Democratic Legislature, and the expiration of stimulus aid, may have contributed to the school funding cuts and staff reductions.

While it is true that, according to the Eurostat data cited in the article, only 44,000 out of 213,000 asylum seekers between April and June 2015 were fleeing the Syrian civil war, this three-month period does not represent the entire refugee situation.\n\n   The evidence shows that if we look at all of 2015, Syrian refugees accounted for 52 percent of nearly 800,000 Mediterranean sea arrivals. This means that a significant majority of those who went into Europe were indeed Syrian refugees, contradicting Huckabee's claim. Additionally, the evidence also indicates that while not all asylum seekers during this period were Syrian, they came from countries like Afghanistan and Iraq, which are experiencing or recovering from conflict, rather than falsely claiming to be Syrian.\n\n   Therefore, the claim made by Huckabee is misleading because it presents a distorted picture of the refugee situation by focusing on a limited time period and conflating two separate phenomena: the Mediterranean crisis and internal migration between different European states.

The evidence presented supports this claim by providing multiple sources that confirm the number of uninsured residents in Texas (6.4 million in 2012, according to the Census Bureau), the number of adults on Medicaid at the time (around 1 million, according to the state Health and Human Services Commission), and the potential increase in enrollment with expansion (1.4 million estimated by the state commission and 1.7 million from the Urban Institute).\n\nFurthermore, it is stated that under Obamacare, federal government offered to pay for expanding Medicaid to adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level, and that Texas rejected this offer. Therefore, if Texas had accepted the deal, those who were not eligible before but would be under expansion (approximately 1.7 million uninsured adults according to Urban Institute) could have obtained health insurance right away.\n\nLastly, the evidence provides estimates of how many newly eligible adults are expected to sign up immediately with Medicaid expansion, which ranges from 341,000 in 2014 to over 1 million by 2016 (according to the state agency).

Therefore, incidents in which only two or three people are shot (the average Rubens offered when civilians take action) would generally be excluded from the category of mass shootings.\n\nAdditionally, the article states that there were only three cases documented where an armed civilian shot the attacker, and in two of those incidents, the civilian who took action was an off-duty police officer.

The article mentions that this was corrected from an earlier version that implied Brown was on death row, stating \"With nothing but the rest of his life in prison ahead of him,\" and clarifying that it was a copy editing error.\n\nAs for Kaboni Savage, while he was sentenced to death in a federal case for 12 counts of murder, El-Shabazz did not represent Savage during this case. Instead, another attorney (Christopher Warren) handled the defense and El-Shabazz was disqualified due to a conflict of interest related to an earlier case involving Savage.\n\nIn conclusion, El-Shabazz's statement that none of his clients has ever been sentenced to death is correct, based on the cases mentioned in the article. The article also includes expert opinions confirming this interpretation, stating that given the context and the fact that El-Shabazz was not the attorney during the cases where death sentences were handed down, the statement does not falsify the claim."

    "justification": "The claim \"Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States, while nationally, the real wage has decreased over the past eight years that Congressman (Bruce) Braley has been there by 2.7 percent\" is labeled as conflicting for several reasons based on the evidence provided.\n\nThe first part of the claim states that Iowa has the fourth fastest-growing personal income in the United States, which is supported by data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. However, the evidence shows that while this statement is technically correct during a specific time period (the second quarter of 2014), it is contextually misleading as the growth rate fluctuated significantly over the preceding quarters and Iowa ranked much lower in terms of full-year percentage changes compared to other states when studied over a longer period.\n\nThe second part of the claim asserts that the real wage has decreased nationally by 2.7 percent over the past eight years while Congressman Braley was there, but the evidence contradicts this statement. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers have remained relatively stable from 2005 to 2013 when adjusting for inflation. In fact, real wages in Iowa have grown faster over the same period compared to the national average, though not by the stated 2.7 percent decrease.\n\nOverall, the claim is conflicting because it presents inaccurate or misleading information regarding both personal income growth in Iowa and wage stagnation nationally during Congressman Braley's tenure. The comparison made between two different statistics (personal income and real wages) and two different time periods (most recent quarter versus the past eight years) also contributes to the conflict as it is not a meaningful or fair contrast to make."

    "claim": "\"In 1968, a full-time worker earning minimum wage, could actually support a family of three above the poverty line. Today, that same worker would earn less than the poverty line for a family of two.\"",

    "justification": "The claim is \"In 1968, a full-time worker earning minimum wage, could actually support a family of three above the poverty line. Today, that same worker would earn less than the poverty line for a family of two.\" The label for this claim is \"True\".\n\nThe evidence provided supports the truthfulness of this claim. In 1968, the minimum wage was $1.60 an hour, and an employee working full-time (40 hours/week for 52 weeks) would earn $3,328 per year. This income level was above the poverty thresholds for a three-person household that year ($2,817 annually for a home headed by a man and $2,516 for a home headed by a woman). However, it's important to note that there were some employees who were paid less than $1.60 an hour in 1968, which would have put them below the poverty line for a three-person household.\n\nFast forward to modern times, and the minimum wage has been set at $7.25 per hour. A full-time minimum wage earner now makes $15,080 annually. This income level falls slightly below the average 2013 poverty threshold for a family of two ($15,156). Therefore, it is accurate to say that today, that same worker earning the minimum wage would earn less than the poverty line for a family of two.\n\nThe justification for the \"True\" label is based on the comparison of income levels in 1968 and today, as reported by the Economic Policy Institute, which supports the claim that a full-time worker earning minimum wage today cannot support a family of three above the poverty line, and earns less than the poverty line for a family of two."

    "justification": "The label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because while Governor Ralph Northam stated that the technology allows COVID-19 personal protection equipment (PPE) to be decontaminated and reused 20 times without degrading performance, the supporting article provides evidence that contradicts this claim.\n\nThe evidence shows that the decontamination process using hydrogen peroxide vapor, developed by the Battelle Memorial Institute, can indeed decontaminate masks up to 20 times. However, it is not recommended as a best practice or in normal circumstances due to several factors: limited research on effectiveness, variation in mask performance after repeated use, complications in maintaining mask integrity and fit over time, potential worsening of fit during the decontamination process itself, and the need for hospitals to have additional protocols in place for safely collecting, transporting, and reusing the masks.\n\nFurthermore, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specified that the decontamination system may be effective up to 20 times but advised that recycling should only be done \"when there are insufficient supplies.\" Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends reuse as a crisis capacity strategy only.\n\nGiven these facts, it is clear that while the technology can decontaminate masks up to 20 times, the claim that they can be reused that many times without degrading performance is not supported by the best practices or recommendations from health authorities. This discrepancy between Northam's statement and the evidence provided makes the claim \"Conflicting.\""

The misleading part of the claim is that it might suggest a significant increase from zero, when in reality insurance companies could already charge three times as much for older consumers based on their age.

    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim \"Gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected\" can be labeled as conflicting because the evidence presented does not definitively support or refute this assertion. While it is true that Newt Gingrich accurately quoted a report from the FBI's National Gang Threat Assessment, which stated that there was indeed a 40 percent increase in gang members from 2009 to 2011, the evidence also indicates that there are several concerns about the reliability and validity of these statistics.\n\nFirstly, the FBI's estimate is based on a survey of law enforcement agencies, which may be subject to sampling error due to potential biases in the sample or the accuracy of the responses provided. Secondly, the FBI acknowledges that there may be some duplication or underreporting of gang members because of how each state and local law enforcement agency measures gang activity in their area. Thirdly, there is no universal definition of who counts as a gang member, making it difficult to discern accurate numbers. Fourthly, local law enforcement officials have an interest in overstating the number of gang members in their jurisdiction, since a bigger gang problem can help them secure more federal assistance. Lastly, the enormous increase in two years (as claimed by Gingrich) is questioned by criminologists, as it has not correlated with a significant increase in overall crime rates.\n\nIn addition, the evidence suggests that the former House speaker Newt Gingrich may have used Obama's presidency to mark time when discussing gang growth, but it is unclear from the provided evidence whether he intended to directly blame the president for an increase in gang activity. This ambiguity further supports the label of conflicting.\n\nIn summary, the label \"Conflicting\" is appropriate because the claim cannot be definitively verified or falsified based on the available evidence, which raises questions about the reliability and validity of the statistics used to support the claim, as well as the intent behind using Obama's presidency when discussing gang growth."

    "justification": "The claim that Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt is unsustainable and unpayable due to the greed of Wall Street vulture funds is labeled as conflicting because while it is true that Wall Street has played a role in exacerbating the situation, the evidence presented suggests that the majority of the debt was accumulated before Wall Street's involvement. The article mentions that the $72 billion debt did not appear solely due to Wall Street's maneuvers but rather has been building up for decades as a result of U.S. policy, local mismanagement, economic decline, and poor management decisions by the local government. Moreover, it was only in 2014 that hedge funds started purchasing a significant portion of Puerto Rico's debt, which was already unsustainable due to decades of accumulated debt. Therefore, while Wall Street is profiting off the situation, the label \"conflicting\" is appropriate as the claim oversimplifies the complex nature of Puerto Rico's debt crisis and places undue blame on Wall Street for a problem that has deep-rooted causes."

    "justification": "Justification for Label: Conflicting\n\nThe claim by Charlie Crist that Marco Rubio \"attacks me for positions he held, like, six months ago\" can be considered conflicting because the evidence provided demonstrates that both Crist and Rubio have consistently maintained similar or identical policy positions on various issues over an extended period. For instance, they have shown consistency on Social Security, the federal stimulus program, immigration policies, and even their general stances on the role of government in personal matters such as abortion rights.\n\nOn the issue of stem cell research, while Crist's stance has been generally supportive, he did oppose it at certain points in his political career, as demonstrated by his comments during his 1998 Senate run. However, his position seemed to shift over time, as evidenced by his vetoing state budget language banning tax dollars from being used to support human embryonic stem cell research in May 2010. Nevertheless, Crist's stance on this issue has not significantly changed since then, which contradicts the implication that Rubio is attacking him for positions he held six months ago.\n\nThe same can be said about their positions on abortion and Roe v. Wade, where Crist initially identified as pro-choice but opposed overturning Roe v. Wade during his 1998 Senate run. However, in the more recent 2010 Republican U.S. Senate primary, he seemed to take a pro-life stance without explicitly stating his position on Roe v. Wade. Again, this shift in Crist's rhetoric does not seem to be a significant change from the positions he held six months ago, as Rubio claims.\n\nIn terms of their respective attacks on each other, it appears that both candidates have been accused of flip-flopping and hypocrisy, with each candidate criticizing the other for positions they themselves have maintained or defended at different points in their political careers. This mutual criticism creates a conflicting situation where neither candidate can claim that the other is attacking them for positions held six months ago without qualification.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence provided indicates that both Crist and Rubio have maintained consistent policy positions on various issues over time, making it difficult to argue that Crist is being attacked for positions he held six months ago without considering the broader context of their political histories and evolving rhetoric. This situation creates a conflicting claim, as it is unclear whether Crist's accusation against Rubio is based on genuine changes in Rubio's policy positions or simply a matter of political convenience and selective memory regarding their shared political past."

This figure is much higher than the estimated range of 75 to 100 deaths provided in the claim. Furthermore, the number of non-fatal injuries by guns is also higher than the estimate given, with about 7,083 per month reported by the CDC for the year 2015.\n\nWhile it's true that the numbers provided by Ojeda would have been in the ballpark if he had been talking about gun-related deaths per day (with approximately 109 deaths per day), this still does not align with the claim made, which is about monthly figures. Therefore, the label of conflicting is appropriate as the data provided shows a significant discrepancy between the numbers presented in the claim and the official statistics on gun violence."

The deductions at issue do not pertain to outsourcing specifically and are instead standard business expense deductions that apply equally to domestic relocations.\n\nMoreover, the article states that under current law, there is no special provision that gives corporations a tax break or deduction for moving employees out of the country. Therefore, McConnell's votes did not incentivize outsourcing as the claim suggests.\n\nLastly, the article points out that the amount of money associated with these standard deductions is minuscule compared to corporate tax revenue overall and would not have a significant impact on a company's decision to engage in foreign activity. This further undermines the claim that McConnell voted for tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas.\n\nIn summary, while it is true that McConnell voted three times on legislation related to corporate tax deductions, those votes were not for tax breaks that incentivize outsourcing as claimed, and the deductions at issue are standard business expense deductions rather than special provisions for outsourcing.

The evidence reveals that the most recent financial report (as of June 30, 2013) showed the city needed $1.2 billion to cover its current and future pension obligations, supporting Harrop's claim about the funding needed. Moreover, the same report indicated that the Providence pension fund had $336 million in investments and other assets on the same date, which is less than the required funding amount ($1.2 billion), confirming that there was indeed a shortfall in the pension fund as Harrop claimed.

Jerry Brown has proposed 'diverting 30 percent of the funding' from the state\u2019s gas tax increase 'to non-road related projects like building parks and job training for felons'\" can be labeled as conflicting because the evidence provided shows a nuanced situation. On one hand, Assemblywoman Melendez claims that the governor is diverting 30 percent of transportation funding to non-road projects, which contradicts the main focus of the gas tax increase legislation, known as The Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017, intended for road repair and maintenance. On the other hand, the evidence reveals that while approximately 29% (or $818.7 million) of the overall $2.8 billion in new funding is allocated to categories such as rail, transit, active transportation, parks, recreation, food and agriculture, university research, and workforce development programs \u2013 many of which may not be directly related to road projects \u2013 this allocation does not necessarily mean that these funds are being diverted from their intended use. The gas tax increase was always intended to include these categories, according to the California Department of Transportation director Malcolm Dougherty. Additionally, existing laws require some gas tax revenue to go to state parks and food and agriculture programs, as explained in the evidence. Therefore, while there is a significant portion of funds going towards non-road related projects, this allocation does not equate to a diversion from the intended purpose of the gas tax increase, as claimed by Melendez. The article highlights ongoing debate and discussion surrounding the use of these funds, which justifies labeling the claim as conflicting rather than factually true or false."

According to newspaper accounts, the cost of this staircase was approximately $31,983. While it is not explicitly stated that this exact amount was spent on the spiral staircase, the article does mention that Webster spent about $100,000 in total on improvements to House facilities during his first months as Speaker, and the cost of the staircase falls within that range.\n\nMoreover, it is also mentioned that the staircase was intended to make it easier for Webster and other legislators to move between their offices without having to navigate through public areas filled with lobbyists, reporters, and members of the public. This purpose aligns with the common practice among speakers of making changes, upgrades, or renovations to House offices and facilities.\n\nFinally, it is noted that the staircase was closed off in 2006 during more than $500,000 of renovations ordered by then-Speaker Marco Rubio. While the article does not provide specific details about the fate of the staircase, it implies that it was still present at the time of its closure and cost approximately $31,983.\n\nGiven this evidence, it can be concluded that Daniel Webster did indeed spend money on a spiral staircase during his tenure as Speaker of the House, and the cost of this staircase was within the range stated in the claim. Therefore, the label \"True\" is appropriate for this claim."

    "taxonomy_label": "interval",
    "original_label": "False",
    "justification": "The claim that \"Says Travis County\u2019s sheriff refuses to enforce 8 USC 1373\" can be labeled as False because there is no factual evidence presented in the evidence text to support the allegation made by Greg Abbott, who accused the local sheriff of violating the federal law. The evidence text clarifies that Abbott did not specifically single out any law pertaining to local police agencies accepting or refusing \"detainer\" requests from federal authorities seeking a hold on inmates for deportation. Instead, his tweet referred to a 1990s law (8 USC 1373) that bars federal, state or local agencies or officials from restricting any agency or official from sending or receiving information regarding the citizenship status of any individual to/from federal immigration authorities.\n\nFurthermore, Wes Priddy of the sheriff\u2019s department stated there has been no change in operations that would violate the cited law. The policy put in place by Sheriff Sally Hernandez also defends her policy of not automatically honoring every federal request to detain immigrant inmates for up to 48 hours, with the exception of specific cases like murder, aggravated sexual assault or human trafficking or if agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant.\n\nAdditionally, ICE focuses on detainers, and their officers can continue to contact the department directly about an inmate and are allowed to interview jailed individuals subject to ongoing investigations, according to Priddy. Priddy also confirmed that information regarding each suspect booked into the jail is conveyed electronically to the Texas Department of Public Safety and then to federal agencies including ICE.\n\nFinally, the sheriff\u2019s office added a section to their policy (point No. 10) in the interest of clarity, stating that it \"in no way prohibits or restricts sending information to or requesting or receiving information from ICE regarding an individual\u2019s immigration or citizenship status.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence provided does not support the claim that Travis County\u2019s sheriff refuses to enforce 8 USC 1373."

    "claim": "Says 50 percent of millennials don\u2019t associate with \"any political party.\"",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim states that \"50 percent of millennials don\u2019t associate with any political party.\" However, the evidence indicates conflicting information regarding the percentage of millennial non-partisans. While it's true that 50% of millennials describe themselves as independents in one survey by Pew Research Center, the same report reveals that among those 50%, 44% lean Democratic and 31% lean Republican. This implies that when partisan leanings are considered, a majority (44%) still identifies with the Democratic Party. Furthermore, other surveys such as the 2012 survey done by American National Election Studies indicate an even smaller percentage of true independents among millennials. Therefore, while it may be accurate to say that many millennials do not identify strictly with a political party, the claim oversimplifies the complexity of partisan identification and leanings among this generation, hence the label \"Conflicting.\""

    "claim": "Says Libya \"Ambassador (Christopher) Stevens sent 600 requests for help\" in Benghazi.",
    "taxonomy_label": "statistical",
    "original_label": "Conflicting",
    "justification": "The claim that \"Christopher Stevens sent 600 requests for help in Benghazi\" is labeled as conflicting because there is clear contradictory evidence presented in the article text. The article states that during the investigation of the events in Benghazi, no such number of specific requests for help from Ambassador Stevens was found. In fact, it mentions that the Republicans' count is 569, not 600, and even if all of these requests originated from Stevens, the highest number Trump could cite would be 205, not 600. Additionally, the source suggests that there may have been some duplication in the count, which further undermines the claim that a specific number of 600 requests were made. Furthermore, it is noted that it's not even clear if all these requests were actually for Benghazi or involved the U.S. embassy in Tripoli as well. The article concludes by stating that few, if any, of these requests were likely from Stevens, making the claim even more questionable. Therefore, given this evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is conflicting with the facts presented in the investigation of the events in Benghazi."
