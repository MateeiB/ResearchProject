Additionally, John D. Lowry played a key role in restoring and preserving the movie. \n\nLabel: SUPPORTED. The evidence provided clearly supports the claim that Bambi is based on a book by Felix Salten.\n\n\nConsider three movies, each of which is either based on a book written by a specific author or not. In this puzzle, we'll use the property of transitivity to establish relationships between these movies. \n\n1. Movie A: Is it based on a book by Felix Salten?\n2. Movie B: Is it based on a book by John D. Lowry?\n3. Movie C: Is one of the books written by Felix Salten and John D. Lowry?\n\nRules:\n- Only movies that are based on a book are considered as \"Based on a Book\" in this puzzle.\n- A movie is considered \"Based on a Book\" if it's not mentioned separately as an independent film or animation.\n\nQuestion: Is Movie C 'Based on a Book'?\n\n\nWe use the property of transitivity to determine relationships between movies based on their authors' works and the evidence given in the conversation. Here's how we do that:\n- We know from the conversation, Movie A is \"Bambi\" which is based on a book by Felix Salten.\n- The Country Bears is also mentioned as being based on a different author's work (John D. Lowry).\nHowever, it does not mention anything about \"Der Hund von Florenz\", so we can't directly say if it's related to either author. This leaves us with Movie C.\n\n\nTo determine whether movie C is 'Based on a Book', we need to make an inductive logic. \nWe know that movies are only considered \"Based on a book\" if they're not mentioned separately as an independent film or animation. \nHere, there's no direct information provided about Movie C being mentioned separately as an independent film or animation. So, using the principle of exhaustion - we've examined all other possible situations and have no other evidence to go on \u2013 it can be inferred that Movie C might not be 'Based on a Book'.\n\nAnswer: We cannot definitively determine if movie C is 'Based on a Book' without more information."
